    "title": "Supreme Court Issues Citizens United Decision Enabling Unlimited Corporate Political Spending",
    "summary": "In a landmark 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC that corporations have First Amendment rights to make unlimited independent political expenditures, fundamentally transforming campaign finance law. The decision overturned key provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on political advertising. Rooted in Justice Lewis Powell's decades-long constitutional strategy, the ruling enabled the creation of Super PACs and dramatically increased dark money in politics, with corporations gaining unprecedented political influence. The decision has been widely criticized for promoting corporate personhood and giving disproportionate political power to large corporations.",
