The machinery of democratic subversion is no longer being assembled in darkness‚Äîit's operating in broad daylight, with governments openly punishing prosecutors, sanctioning judges, and declaring emergencies to bypass all constraints. The question is no longer whether democratic backsliding is occurring, but whether any institutions remain capable of stopping it.
