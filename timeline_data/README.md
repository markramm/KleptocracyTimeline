## Naming Convention

### CRITICAL: No Underscores Allowed

**File names and IDs must use HYPHENS ONLY - NO UNDERSCORES**

### File Names
Event files must follow this strict naming pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD--event-id-with-hyphens.yaml
```

**Rules:**
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601)
- Separator: `--` (double hyphen between date and ID)
- ID: lowercase letters, numbers, and **hyphens only**
- **NO UNDERSCORES (_)** anywhere in filenames or IDs
- Extension: `.yaml`

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `2024-01-15--trump-cabinet-wealth-report.yaml`
- ‚úÖ `2025-03-01--scotus-ruling-chevron.yaml`  
- ‚úÖ `2024-06-27--scotus-sec-v-jarkesy.yaml`
- ‚ùå `2024_01_15--event.yaml` (underscores in date)
- ‚ùå `2024-01-15--event_name.yaml` (underscores in ID)
- ‚ùå `2024-01-15--scotus_ruling.yaml` (underscores not allowed)

### Event IDs
The `id` field in the YAML must match the ID portion of the filename:
```yaml
id: trump-cabinet-wealth  # ‚úÖ Correct - uses hyphens
id: trump_cabinet_wealth  # ‚ùå Wrong - uses underscores
```

**ID Requirements:**
- Use hyphens (-) not underscores (_)
- Keep descriptive but concise
- Must be unique across all events
- Must exactly match the filename ID portion

All timeline files follow strict naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD--event-description.yaml`

### Format Rules
- **Date prefix**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Separator**: Double dash (`--`) separates date from description
- **Description**: Lowercase, hyphens between words, no underscores
- **Extension**: Always `.yaml`

### Examples
‚úÖ Correct: `2024-11-05--election-results-announced.yaml`
‚ùå Wrong: `2024-11-05_election_results.yaml` (uses underscore)
‚ùå Wrong: `2024-11-5--election.yaml` (date not zero-padded)

## Event Schema

### Required Fields

```yaml

## Citation Requirements

### Verification Status Levels

#### 1. **Confirmed** (Highest Standard)
- ‚úÖ Event date is in the past
- ‚úÖ Multiple credible sources (2+ preferred)
- ‚úÖ Sources have been accessed and content verified
- ‚úÖ All claims in summary are supported by sources
- ‚úÖ Archive URLs provided for key sources
- ‚úÖ No contradicting credible reports

#### 3. **Predicted**
- Future events based on official announcements
- Scheduled proceedings (trials, hearings, elections)
- Policy implementations with set dates
- Must update to confirmed/disputed after date passes

#### 4. **Disputed**
- Conflicting credible reports exist
- Key facts are contested
- Different sources report different versions
- Requires note explaining the dispute

### Source Format Requirements

```yaml
sources:
  - title: Full Article Headline      # REQUIRED: Exact headline
    url: https://original.url         # REQUIRED: Original URL
    outlet: Washington Post           # REQUIRED: Publication name
    date: '2024-01-15'                # REQUIRED: Publication date
    archived_url: https://web.archive.org/... # STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
    author: Jane Doe                  # Optional: Byline
    verified_claims:                  # Optional: For tracking
      - "Attorney General resignation"

```

### Archive Requirements

**Priority Archives** (Must archive within 48 hours):
- Government statements/documents
- Corporate press releases
- Controversial or disputed events
- Sources from outlets prone to paywall/deletion
- Social media posts

**Archive Services** (in order of preference):
1. Internet Archive (archive.org)
2. Archive.today (archive.is)
3. Perma.cc (for legal documents)
4. Screenshots with metadata (last resort)

## Inclusion Criteria

### Required Criteria (Must Meet ALL)

1. **Democratic Relevance**
   - Impacts democratic institutions or norms
   - Demonstrates capture or corruption patterns
   - Affects electoral integrity
   - Involves disinformation/information warfare
   - Shows regulatory or judicial capture

2. **Systemic Significance**
   - Not an isolated incident
   - Part of documented pattern
   - Sets precedent or policy
   - Has measurable institutional impact
   - Affects multiple stakeholders

3. **Factual Verifiability**
   - Based on documented facts, not speculation
   - Has specific date and details
   - Named actors (not anonymous sources only)
   - Corroborated by credible sources

4. **Neutral Documentation**
   - Uses objective, factual language
   - Avoids editorial commentary in title/summary
   - Includes relevant perspectives
   - Separates facts from analysis

### Exclusion Criteria (Do NOT Include)

‚ùå Opinion pieces without factual events
‚ùå Unverified rumors or speculation
‚ùå Personal scandals without systemic relevance
‚ùå Minor policy disagreements
‚ùå Events without reliable sources
‚ùå Duplicate events (merge instead)
‚ùå Pure predictions without official basis

### Edge Cases

For borderline events, ask:
1. Will this matter in 5 years?
2. Does it reveal systemic issues?
3. Is it part of a larger pattern?
4. Can it be objectively documented?

If 3+ are "yes", consider inclusion with `pending` status.

## Search Methodology

   - Review government releases
   ```

2. **Verification Steps**
   ```
   - Find original source/document
   - Cross-reference 2+ sources
   - Check for corrections/retractions
   - Verify dates and actors
   - Look for opposing viewpoints
   ```

   ```
   - Create timeline entry with pending status
   - Add all sources with dates
   - Create archive URLs
   - Note any disputes or uncertainties
   - Update status after full verification
   ```

### Testing Methodology

Before marking as `confirmed`, verify:

- [ ] Date accuracy (check multiple sources)
- [ ] Actor identification (full names, roles)
- [ ] Claim verification (each claim has source)
- [ ] Source quality (credible, accessible)
- [ ] Archive creation (especially priority sources)
- [ ] Pattern identification (link related events)
- [ ] Neutral language (remove editorial tone)
