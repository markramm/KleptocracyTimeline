title: U.S. Global Change Research Program dismantled with staff removed
summary: Trump administration dismantled 35-year-old U.S. Global Change Research Program
  (USGCRP) end of January 2025. Federal employees removed Tuesday, ICF International contract
  severed. Nearly 400 scientists informed Monday their services no longer needed for National
  Climate Assessment. Project 2025's Russ Vought wrote chapter on reshaping USGCRP to elevate
  "benefits" of climate change. David Legates said program needs to be "closed down, lock,
  stock and barrel," alerted Musk's DOGE.

notes: Multiple climate websites taken offline as part of dismantling. Program tracked
  global climate change and shaped regulations across government. Under Vought's proposal,
  USGCRP would be "confined to more limited advisory role" because "USGCRP actions can
  frustrate successful litigation defense." OMB would select researchers who question
  human contributions to climate change, give equal weight to industry studies.
