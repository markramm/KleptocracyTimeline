title: Administration deliberately evades court order on Venezuelan gang deportations
summary: U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found probable cause that the Trump administration
  showed "willful disregard" for his order to halt deportation flights of Venezuelan
  migrants. The administration flew planes with hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador
  despite the judge's order to return them to the U.S., deliberately rushing planes
  into international airspace to evade jurisdiction. A whistleblower reported DOJ
  official Emil Bove told attorneys they may need to tell courts "f*** you" regarding
  such orders.
