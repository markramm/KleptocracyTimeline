notes: This massive investment framework was announced just one month before the June
  2025 Iran strikes that eliminated Saudi Arabia's primary security threat, raising
  questions about whether the investment commitments influenced subsequent military
  decisions. Creates textbook emoluments violation by establishing massive foreign
  investment framework that benefits both U.S. interests and Trump's personal business
  empire, demonstrating how foreign governments can leverage business relationships
  to influence policy decisions.
