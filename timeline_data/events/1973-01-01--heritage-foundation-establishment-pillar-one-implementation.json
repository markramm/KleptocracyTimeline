  "date": "1973-01-01",
  "description": "The Heritage Foundation is established as a $100 million operation implementing the intellectual infrastructure pillar of the Powell Memorandum strategy. Rather than traditional lobbying, Heritage operates as an 'idea factory' designed to reshape fundamental assumptions about government and markets through seemingly neutral scholarly analysis. The foundation recruits academic stars, funds graduate students, and creates an intellectual ecosystem that makes corporate-friendly policies appear to emerge from independent research, establishing the template for systematic intellectual capture.",
