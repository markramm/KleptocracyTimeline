title: Brookings warns on legal limits of putting soldiers on Los Angeles streets
date: '2025-06-26'
summary: Brookings Institution legal scholars published an analysis on June 26, 2025,
  warning that the Trump administration's deployment of 700 Marines and federalized
  National Guard to Los Angeles streets violates legal limits and the Posse Comitatus Act.
  They analyzed the June 7 DOD memorandum authorizing military support for DHS immigration
  operations, concluding it dangerously expands Insurrection Act interpretation and
  normalizes using troops for domestic law enforcement without proper legal justification.

notes: This analysis came after federal courts found the LA deployment likely unlawful
  (June 12) but the Ninth Circuit stayed that ruling (June 19). Brookings warned this
  sets dangerous precedent for militarizing domestic law enforcement.
