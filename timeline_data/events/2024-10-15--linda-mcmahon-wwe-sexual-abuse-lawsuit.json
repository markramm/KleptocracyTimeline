  "summary": "Trump's Education Secretary nominee Linda McMahon was named in a lawsuit alleging she and Vince McMahon turned a blind eye to years of sexual abuse of underage \"ring boys\" by WWE announcer Melvin Phillips in the 1980s-90s. The lawsuit claims the McMahons knew about Phillips' abuse as early as the mid-1980s but only fired him in 1988 after continued allegations. Five anonymous plaintiffs, ages 13-15 when recruited, filed the suit.",
