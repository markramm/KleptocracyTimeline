title: Trump Campaign Organizes Fake Electors in Seven States
summary: The Trump campaign organized groups of fake electors to meet and cast fraudulent
  electoral votes in seven states Biden won - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada,
  New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These 84 fake electors signed false certificates
  claiming to be the 'duly elected' electors and sent them to Congress and the National
  Archives. RNC officials assisted at Trump's direct request, with emails showing
  campaign lawyers coordinating the scheme. Multiple participants have been criminally
  charged, with Michigan charging 16 fake electors with forgery and conspiracy. Kenneth
  Chesebro and Sidney Powell pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in Georgia. The
  fake certificates were intended for use on January 6 when Vice President Pence would
  count electoral votes. The scheme represented an unprecedented attempt to subvert
  the Electoral College system.
