  for allegedly leaking internal company information to competitors. Path founder Marshal Webb
  stated "This is unacceptable and there is zero tolerance for this." Shortly after Coristine's

  Law enforcement officials tracked Coristine in cybercrime chat rooms under usernames
  "Rivage" and "JoeyCrafter." In November 2022, "JoeyCrafter" posted seeking "capable,
  powerful & reliable L7" referring to Layer 7 DDoS attacks. EGodly thanked DiamondCDN
  in 2023 for providing "amazing DDoS protection and caching systems."
