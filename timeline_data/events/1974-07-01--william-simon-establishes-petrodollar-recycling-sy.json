  "title": "William Simon Establishes Petrodollar Recycling System",
  "summary": "US Treasury Secretary William Simon, fresh from the Salomon Brothers trading desk, arrived in Riyadh with instructions from President Nixon to negotiate a pivotal deal with Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani. Simon proposed that the US purchase large amounts of Saudi oil in dollars, with the Saudis using these dollars to buy US Treasury bonds, weaponry, and invest in US banks - creating the petrodollar recycling system. This arrangement addressed the critical threat to dollar supremacy following Nixon's 1971 decision to end dollar convertibility to gold amid mounting trade deficits and dwindling gold reserves. The deal structure included Saudi recycling of oil revenues into US Treasuries, US military protection and arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and a commitment that Saudi oil would be priced exclusively in dollars. King Faisal requested that Saudi purchases of US Treasury holdings remain secret, a condition maintained until 2016.",
