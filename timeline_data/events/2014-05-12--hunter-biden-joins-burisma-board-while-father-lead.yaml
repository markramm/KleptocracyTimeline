title: Hunter Biden Joins Burisma Board While Father Leads Ukraine Policy
summary: Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings,
  receiving up to $50,000 per month while his father Vice President Joe Biden led
  U.S. policy on Ukraine. State Department officials raised conflict of interest concerns
  in 2015. Devon Archer later testified to Congress that Hunter Biden was selling
  "the brand" and that Burisma would have "gone out of business" without the Biden
  name attached. Senate investigators documented over $3.15 million in payments to
  Hunter Biden's firm Rosemont Seneca Bohai from Burisma between 2014-2019.
