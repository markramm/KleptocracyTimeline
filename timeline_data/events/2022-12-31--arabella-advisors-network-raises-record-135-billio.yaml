title: Arabella Advisors Network Raises Record $1.35 Billion in Dark Money
summary: The Arabella Advisors network, managing five nonprofit funds including the
  Sixteen Thirty Fund, raised $1.35 billion from anonymous donors in 2022, making
  it the dominant force in Democratic dark money operations. The Sixteen Thirty Fund
  alone spent $196 million on political causes including $66 million supporting liberal
  politicians and ballot initiatives. Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss has contributed
  $245 million to Arabella entities since 2016, with $208 million going to the Sixteen
  Thirty Fund. The Atlantic called it 'the indisputable heavyweight of Democratic
  dark money,' noting it was the second-largest super-PAC donor in 2020. The network
  faced scrutiny in September 2022 when the D.C. attorney general issued subpoenas
  seeking information on alleged financial mismanagement.
