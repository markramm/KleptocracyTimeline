  "summary": "EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned facing at least 14 federal investigations \ninto corruption, ethics violations, and misuse of taxpayer funds. Scandals included: \nspending $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth, first-class travel costing over \n$100,000, using staff for personal errands like finding his wife a job and getting \na Chick-fil-A franchise, renting a Capitol Hill condo from a lobbyist for $50/night, \n24/7 security detail costing $3 million, and bypassing White House to give raises \nto favored aides. As Oklahoma AG, Pruitt had sued the EPA 14 times before leading \nit, epitomizing regulatory capture.\n",

  "notes": "Pruitt's tenure represented the most extreme case of regulatory capture - an oil \nindustry ally dismantling environmental protections from within. He met almost \nexclusively with industry representatives, rolled back dozens of regulations, and \ndeleted climate change references from EPA materials. His replacement, Andrew Wheeler, \nwas a former coal lobbyist, continuing the pattern of industry insiders running \nagencies meant to regulate those industries. Trump praised Pruitt even as he resigned.\n",
