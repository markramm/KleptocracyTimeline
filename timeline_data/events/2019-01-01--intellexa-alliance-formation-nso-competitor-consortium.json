  "title": "Intellexa Alliance Forms as \"Star Alliance of Spyware\" to Compete with NSO",
  "summary": "The Intellexa Alliance is formed as a marketing consortium of mercenary surveillance vendors to compete against NSO Group and Verint. The alliance includes Nexa Technologies (formerly Amesys), WiSpear/Passitora Ltd., Cytrox, and Senpai Technologies. Former Israeli Defense Forces commander Tal Dilian acquires Cytrox for under $5 million, rescuing the company and integrating it into the broader Intellexa ecosystem. This systematic coordination creates a European-based alternative to Israeli spyware dominance, with operations spanning North Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, and Ireland.",
