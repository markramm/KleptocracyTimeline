title: Elizabeth Warren reads 100 acts of Trump corruption into Congressional Record
  on 100th day
summary: Senator Elizabeth Warren marked Trump's 100th day in office by reading a
  comprehensive list of 100 documented acts of corruption into the Congressional Record.
  The list included the mass firing of 18 Inspectors General, the Trump family's $320+
  million cryptocurrency scheme, systematic removal of officials investigating Elon
  Musk's companies, $940 million in coerced free legal services, and unprecedented
  pay-for-access arrangements. Warren's speech created an official government record
  of the administration's kleptocratic actions, documenting the transformation of
  the U.S. government into a vehicle for personal enrichment.
