  "title": "Former Malaysian PM Najib Razak Charged in 1MDB Scandal",
  "summary": "Malaysian authorities charged former Prime Minister Najib Razak with criminal breach of trust, corruption, and money laundering related to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) sovereign wealth fund scandal. The charges marked a dramatic fall for Najib, who lost power in May 2018 partly due to public anger over the scandal. Investigators alleged that $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009-2014, with funds used to purchase luxury real estate, artwork, and jewelry worldwide. The scandal implicated high-profile figures including financier Jho Low, who orchestrated much of the scheme, and Goldman Sachs executives who helped raise money for 1MDB. US authorities estimated that over $1 billion flowed through Najib's personal accounts, including funds used to finance the Hollywood film 'The Wolf of Wall Street.' The case became a global symbol of kleptocracy, involving money laundering through luxury purchases, political donations, and high-end real estate in multiple countries.",
