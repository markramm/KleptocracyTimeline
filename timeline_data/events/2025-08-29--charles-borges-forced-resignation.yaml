title: SSA whistleblower Charles Borges forced to resign after exposing data breach
summary: |
  Charles Borges, SSA's Chief Data Officer, submitted an "involuntary resignation" citing
  retaliation after his whistleblower complaint about DOGE's mishandling of 300 million
  Americans' Social Security data became public. Borges reported experiencing "exclusion,
  isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear" creating intolerable work conditions.
  His resignation email was deleted from staff inboxes within 30 minutes, and SSA employees
  reported extremely low morale after "losing a ton of people" since DOGE's installation.

notes: |
  Borges accused SSA CIO Aram Moghaddassi (longtime Musk ally) of violating policies to
  create unsecured cloud copy of Social Security data. His resignation letter stated SSA's
  actions made his duties "impossible to perform legally and ethically." Posted on LinkedIn:
  "It is never wrong to be morally and ethically right with yourself."
