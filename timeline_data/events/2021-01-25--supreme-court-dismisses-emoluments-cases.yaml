title: Supreme Court Dismisses All Trump Emoluments Cases as Moot
summary: Supreme Court dismissed all three pending emoluments clause lawsuits against
  Trump as moot after he left office, including CREW v. Trump, DC/Maryland v. Trump,
  and Blumenthal v. Trump (200+ Democratic members of Congress). The Court vacated
  lower court decisions that had allowed cases to proceed, eliminating legal precedent
  and leaving constitutional questions about presidential business conflicts permanently
  unresolved. This created enforcement vacuum for future presidents accepting foreign
  payments.

notes: By waiting until Trump left office to dismiss cases, Supreme Court effectively
  immunized presidential profiteering from foreign governments. No president has ever
  been held accountable for emoluments violations.
