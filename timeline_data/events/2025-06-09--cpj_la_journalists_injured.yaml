  enforcement injured multiple journalists and assaulted others while they covered
  immigration protests in Los Angeles. The injuries occurred during federal military
  deployment to LA, with reporters hit by rubber bullets, tear gas, and physical assaults
  despite clear press identification. This preceded the July 11 federal court order
  prohibiting LAPD from using less-lethal weapons on journalists.
