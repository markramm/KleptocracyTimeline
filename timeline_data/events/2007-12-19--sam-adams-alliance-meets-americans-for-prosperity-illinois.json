  "summary": "The Sam Adams Alliance hosts a \"Meetup with Americans For Prosperity-Illinois\" on December 19, 2007, documenting early coordination between Koch network organizations in the pre-Tea Party period. This meeting represents part of the systematic groundwork being laid by Koch-funded organizations to create grassroots-appearing astroturf networks. The Sam Adams Alliance would later be profiled by The New York Times in July 2008 for its ties to the Koch brothers Americans for Prosperity network. This coordination demonstrates how the Koch network was building state-level political infrastructure more than a year before the Tea Party movement officially launched in February 2009.",
