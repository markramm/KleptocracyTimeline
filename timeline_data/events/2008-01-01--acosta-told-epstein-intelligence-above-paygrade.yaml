title: "Report: Acosta told Trump transition Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' (unconfirmed)"
summary: Investigative reporter Vicky Ward wrote in 2019 that, during Donald Trump's
  transition vetting, Alexander Acosta explained he had been told to 'back off' because
  Jeffrey Epstein 'belonged to intelligence.' No U.S. government review has substantiated
  intelligence ties; DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility later criticized the
  2007 non-prosecution agreement on other grounds without noting any intelligence issues.
