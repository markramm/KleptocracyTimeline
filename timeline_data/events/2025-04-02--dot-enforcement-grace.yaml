summary: DOT Secretary Sean Duffy announced April 2, 2025, sweeping suspension of
  greenhouse gas emissions enforcement, rescinding Biden-era GHG measurement rule
  that required states to track/reduce highway emissions. Following Trump's "Woke
  Rescission" memo, DOT eliminated climate change requirements for federal transportation
  funds. Two federal judges had already ruled DOT lacked authority for the emissions
  rule. Part of broader EPA/DOT rollbacks beginning Feb 18.

notes: DOT "Woke Rescission" memo directed elimination of all climate change, DEI,
  environmental justice policies by Feb 8. GHG rule would have required state DOTs
  to measure CO2 emissions on federal highways. Trump admin called it "unlawful" despite
  rule existing since Obama admin. EPA simultaneously rolled back 2027 NOx emissions
  standards for heavy-duty engines. First completed deregulatory action <100 days
  into administration.
