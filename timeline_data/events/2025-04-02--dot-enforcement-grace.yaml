date: '2025-04-02'
summary: The Department of Transportation announced an enforcement grace period on April 2,
  2025, suspending enforcement of new emissions standards until August 1, 2025. This four-month
  pause allows vehicles and equipment to operate without meeting federal emissions requirements,
  effectively permitting increased pollution during the grace period.
