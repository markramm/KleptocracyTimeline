The twelve-count indictment included wire fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering charges spanning from 2018 to 2023.

Authorities seized over 34 million in fraud proceeds, including 78 million from Himalaya Exchange accounts. The arrest exposed how Guo had leveraged his anti-Communist Party platform and American political connections to perpetrate one of the largest fraud schemes prosecuted by the Southern District of New York, while simultaneously operating influence networks including the Gettr social media platform.",
