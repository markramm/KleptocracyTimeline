  "title": "Heritage Foundation Founded as Conservative Think Tank Implementing Powell Strategy",
  "summary": "The Heritage Foundation is officially founded by Paul Weyrich, Edwin Feulner, and Joseph Coors, implementing the strategic vision outlined in the Powell Memorandum. Coors provides the crucial seed funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2021 dollars) to establish what becomes one of the most influential conservative think tanks in American politics. The organization is conceived as a conservative counterpart to the Brookings Institution, designed to provide intellectual ammunition for conservative policy positions and counter liberal academic influence. Weyrich serves as the first president, while Feulner becomes a founding trustee and later president. The foundation's creation represents a direct response to Powell's call for organized, well-funded conservative intellectual infrastructure to shape public policy and political discourse. This marks the beginning of systematic conservative think tank proliferation that will fundamentally alter American political debate.",
