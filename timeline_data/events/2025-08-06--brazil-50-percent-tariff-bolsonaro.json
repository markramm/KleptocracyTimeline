  "notes": "This represents a dangerous new precedent: using trade policy to punish countries for prosecuting corruption and coup attempts. Brazil's prosecution of Bolsonaro follows legitimate legal processes for his role in the January 8, 2023 attack on government buildings (Brazil's own January 6th). By imposing tariffs explicitly to protect Bolsonaro from prosecution, Trump signals that the US will use economic warfare to shield authoritarian allies from accountability. The $7.4 billion trade surplus makes this economically self-destructive, showing it's purely about protecting corrupt leaders globally.",
