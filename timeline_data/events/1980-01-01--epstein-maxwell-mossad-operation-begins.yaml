notes: Use cautious language and identify this as a claim attributed to Ari Ben‑Menashe.
  No primary documentary evidence has been produced in U.S. courts, and recent statements
  by Israeli officials, including former PM Naftali Bennett, reject the 'Mossad' narrative.
  Balance any inclusion of this item with clear labeling as 'disputed'.
