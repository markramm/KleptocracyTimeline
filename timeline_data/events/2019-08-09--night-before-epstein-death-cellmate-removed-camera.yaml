title: Night before Epstein death - cellmate removed, cameras will malfunction, guards
  will sleep
summary: On the night before Jeffrey Epstein's death, his cellmate was mysteriously
  removed from his cell, surveillance cameras would malfunction during critical hours,
  and guards assigned to monitor him would fall asleep during their shifts. These
  'coincidences' created the perfect conditions for what would be ruled a suicide
  the following morning.
