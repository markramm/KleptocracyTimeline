title: Trump launches $TRUMP memecoin three days before inauguration
summary: Donald Trump launched the $TRUMP memecoin on January 17, 2025 at 9 PM via TruthSocial,
  three days before his inauguration. The token reached a $27 billion market cap within
  24 hours, with Trump's 800 million tokens (held by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC)
  briefly valued over $20 billion. While Trump entities earned $350 million in fees,
  813,294 retail investors lost $2 billion according to NYT analysis, with the price
  reaching $73 before dropping below $40 after inauguration. Ethics experts condemned
  it as unprecedented monetization of the presidency.
