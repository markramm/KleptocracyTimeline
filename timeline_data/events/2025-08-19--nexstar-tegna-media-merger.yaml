notes: This merger represents dangerous media consolidation that threatens local journalism
  and democratic discourse. When one company controls TV stations reaching 80% of
  American households, it gains unprecedented power to shape public opinion and political
  narratives. The Trump administration's explicit creation of a "regulatory-friendly
  environment" shows how deregulation serves media monopolization. Combined with the
  Gray Media acquisitions, we're seeing rapid consolidation of local news into a few
  corporate hands, reducing diverse perspectives and enabling coordinated propaganda.
  Local news, trusted by communities, becomes a vector for centralized messaging.
