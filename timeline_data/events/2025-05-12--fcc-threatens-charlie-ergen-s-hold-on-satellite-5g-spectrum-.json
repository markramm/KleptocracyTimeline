    "title": "FCC Launches Inquiry into EchoStar's Satellite Spectrum Utilization",
    "summary": "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr initiated an official inquiry into EchoStar's Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) spectrum utilization after SpaceX challenged the company's license compliance. SpaceX alleged EchoStar was using less than 5% of its allocated spectrum, potentially setting the stage for license reallocation. This inquiry coincided with broader FCC efforts to optimize spectrum efficiency and promote 5G and satellite communication infrastructure.",
