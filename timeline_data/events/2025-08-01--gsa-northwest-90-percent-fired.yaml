title: GSA northwest region sees 90% of employees fired
summary: By March 2025, entire regions of GSA were effectively fired, with 90% of roughly
  200 employees in the northwest region's Public Buildings Service terminated. GSA also
  fired all 100 employees in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and at least 600
  more in late February. Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian created a "murder board"
  to identify positions to cut, targeting a 63% total workforce reduction (3,557 positions).

notes: 'Elon Musk announced on X that GSA''s 18F technology team "has been deleted,"'
  with roughly 90 federal technologists fired around midnight as part of reduction-in-force.
  This represents one of the most extreme targeted eliminations of federal expertise.
