  "date": "1971-08-23",
  "description": "Future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell drafts 'Attack on American Free Enterprise System,' a comprehensive strategy for corporate capture of American democratic institutions through four coordinated pillars: intellectual infrastructure (think tanks, universities), legal capture (Federalist Society, corporate-friendly precedents), media control (parallel conservative media ecosystem), and political integration (lobbying, revolving door). The memorandum establishes the systematic approach that will transform American democracy over the following 50 years, creating the institutional foundation for oligarchic capture.",
