notes: This represents the most dramatic purge of federal employees in US history.
  A 41,311% increase is not normal attrition or performance management - it's systematic
  political cleansing of the civil service. The targeting of specific agencies like
  Interior (environmental protection), Forest Service (public lands), CFPB (consumer
  protection), and SBA (small business support) shows the purge focuses on agencies
  that regulate corporate interests or provide public services. Combined with Schedule
  F stripping protections from 50,000 positions, this transforms the federal government
  from a professional civil service into a patronage system where political loyalty
  trumps expertise. The scale suggests not just policy change but fundamental restructuring
  of American governance.
