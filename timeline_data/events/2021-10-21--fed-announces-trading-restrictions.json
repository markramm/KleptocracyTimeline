  "title": "Fed Announces 'Tough New Rules' After Trading Scandal",
  "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announces new ethics rules barring senior officials from actively trading individual securities following the Kaplan-Rosengren scandal, but critics argue the rules are inadequate and lack enforcement mechanisms. The policy gives the Fed's Designated Agency Ethics Officer 'sole discretion' to decide whether violations are material, with the Officer appointed and removable by the Fed Chair, creating systematic conflict of interest where officials can protect themselves from accountability. Senator Elizabeth Warren calls the policy 'a dismal failure' ridden with conflicts of interest.",
