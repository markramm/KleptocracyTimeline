title: Critical Briefing - Bondi Informs Trump His Name Appears in Epstein Files
summary: In mid-May 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Donald Trump that his
  name appeared multiple times throughout the Epstein documents. According to sources
  who spoke to WSJ and CNN, the files contained "several unsubstantiated claims about
  Trump and others that the Justice Department found not to be credible." This briefing
  fundamentally altered the administration's approach to releasing the files.
