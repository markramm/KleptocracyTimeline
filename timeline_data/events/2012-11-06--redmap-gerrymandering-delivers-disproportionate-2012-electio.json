  "title": "REDMAP Gerrymandering Delivers Disproportionate 2012 Election Results",
  "date": "2012-11-06",
  "description": "The first election under REDMAP's gerrymandered congressional maps demonstrates the devastating effectiveness of systematic redistricting manipulation. Despite Democratic House candidates receiving 1.4 million more votes nationally than Republicans, the GOP retains control of the House with a 234-201 majority. The gerrymandered maps produce extreme distortions in key swing states: In Pennsylvania, Democrats win 51% of votes but secure only 28% of legislative seats and lose the congressional delegation 13-5 despite casting 83,000 more votes for Democratic candidates. Wisconsin Democrats win 53% of statewide votes but capture only 36 of 99 Assembly seats, while Obama wins the state by nearly 7 points yet Republicans maintain a 5-3 congressional majority. Michigan Democrats win the majority of votes but Republicans secure 9 of 14 House seats. Ohio Republicans capture 75% of congressional seats with just over 50% of the vote. These results represent the culmination of REDMAP's $30 million investment and establish a decade-long pattern of minority rule through gerrymandering. The systematic nature of these distortions triggers numerous court challenges, with Pennsylvania's map later declared unconstitutional and Wisconsin's becoming the basis for Gill v. Whitford Supreme Court case.",
