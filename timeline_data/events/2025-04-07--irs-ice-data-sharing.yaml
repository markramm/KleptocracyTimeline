title: IRS forced to share taxpayer data with ICE despite official objections
summary: IRS-ICE data sharing agreement signed April 7 provides ICE access to taxpayer information despite IRS official objections about privacy violations and statutory prohibitions. The agreement, part of DOGE integration breaking down agency silos, enables ICE to use tax return data for targeting and deportation operations. IRS employees reported being given "backpacks full of laptops" for simultaneous access to multiple previously-segregated databases.
