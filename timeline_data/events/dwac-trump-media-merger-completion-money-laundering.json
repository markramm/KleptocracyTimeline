  "title": "DWAC-Trump Media Merger Completes Despite Fraud Investigations and International Money Laundering Probes",
  "summary": "The Digital World Acquisition Corp and Trump Media & Technology Group merger was completed, creating a public company valued at over $5 billion and providing Trump with a potential $3.5 billion windfall. The merger proceeded despite ongoing SEC fraud investigations, criminal insider trading prosecutions, and federal probes into potential money laundering involving Russian oligarch connections. New York investigators had previously examined whether TMTG violated anti-money laundering laws by accepting $8 million connected to Russian sources, while federal authorities discovered that a wealthy DWAC investor was allegedly connected to attempts to move assets from Russia, Ukraine, and China through Caribbean intermediaries. The completion of the merger despite these investigations demonstrated the weakness of regulatory enforcement and the ability of politically connected entities to complete lucrative deals even under active investigation. Trump Media became publicly traded as DJT on NASDAQ, providing a liquid asset for Trump's political and legal financing while retail investors remained exposed to the risks identified by multiple federal investigations into the underlying fraud and money laundering networks.",
