  "date": "2002-09-01",
  "description": "The White House Iraq Group creates a comprehensive talking points distribution system that provides identical messaging frameworks to television networks, ensuring synchronized propaganda dissemination across supposedly independent media platforms. This system enables precise coordination of messaging themes, timing, and framing across multiple networks, creating the appearance of organic consensus while actually orchestrating systematic manipulation. The infrastructure includes daily briefings, message discipline protocols, and coordinated response mechanisms that transform disparate media outlets into components of a unified propaganda apparatus.",
