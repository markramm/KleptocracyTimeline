title: Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman Assassinated by Masked Gunman Posing as Police
summary: Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband killed by Vance Luther
  Boelter, 57-year-old evangelical Christian security company owner wearing realistic
  mask and police disguise. Boelter carried list of approximately 70 targets including
  politicians, abortion providers, and activists. Also visited homes of Senator John
  Hoffman and his wife, wounding both. Attack represents chilling escalation of stochastic
  terrorism where lone actors are inspired by ambient hostile rhetoric rather than direct
  organizational command. Marks dangerous inflection point in decade-long political violence trend.

notes: Northwestern researchers established direct statistical causation between Trump
  tweets and violence magnitude. This assassination exemplifies stochastic terrorism
  pattern where inflammatory rhetoric inspires lone actors without direct commands.
