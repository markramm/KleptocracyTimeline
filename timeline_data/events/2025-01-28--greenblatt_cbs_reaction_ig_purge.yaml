summary: Interior Inspector General Mark Greenblatt, who was originally appointed by
  Trump in his first term, told CBS News he was "stunned" by his Friday night
  firing on January 24, 2025. Greenblatt said "It's very bizarre" and questioned
  the motives, offering two interpretations - either Trump "doesn't believe in our
  independence" or "wants lackeys to rubber stamp what he's trying to do."
