description: Trump revokes Biden's 2021 executive order promoting competition in the
  economy, with DOJ welcoming move toward "America First Antitrust" focused on "free
  markets" instead of enforcement against monopolies. Critics say this undercuts promises
  to protect Americans and favors the rich and powerful.

notes: The revocation of competition enforcement measures represents a direct benefit
  to large corporations and monopolies at the expense of small businesses and consumers.
  The framing as "America First Antitrust" and "free markets" obscures the actual
  impact of reducing enforcement against anti-competitive practices. This aligns with
  the kleptocratic pattern of rewriting rules to benefit economic elites while claiming
  to help ordinary Americans. The timing suggests coordination with major corporate
  donors who opposed Biden's antitrust enforcement.
