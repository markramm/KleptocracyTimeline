The report found\nRussian interference was \"sweeping and systematic\" and violated U.S. criminal law. While\nestablishing \"multiple links\" between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mueller did not find\nsufficient evidence of criminal conspiracy. None of the 140+ contacts were reported to\nauthorities, and the Trump team attempted to cover up every single one.\n",
