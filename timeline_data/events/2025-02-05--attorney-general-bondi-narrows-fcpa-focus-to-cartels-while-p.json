  "title": "Attorney General Bondi Narrows FCPA Focus to Cartels While Pausing Corporate Bribery Cases",
  "summary": "Attorney General Pamela Bondi issued memorandum directing DOJ to prioritize FCPA cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations while Executive Order paused enforcement against American companies bribing foreign officials for business advantages in \"critical minerals, deep-water ports, or other key infrastructure.",
  "description": "The memorandum came five days before Trump's executive order suspending FCPA enforcement for 180 days. The order stated FCPA has been \"abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States\" and that enforcement against American companies for \"routine business practices\" actively harms American economic competitiveness. The pause allows U.S. companies to engage in foreign bribery without consequences, particularly in strategic sectors, while DOJ reviews all existing FCPA investigations with mandate to \"restore proper bounds\" on enforcement.",
