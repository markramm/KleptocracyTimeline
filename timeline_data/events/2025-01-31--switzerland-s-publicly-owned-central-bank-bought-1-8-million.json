  "summary": "The Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank majority owned by public entities,\npurchased 111,300 shares of Trump Media & Technology Group valued at $1.78 million\nduring Q3 2024, according to SEC disclosures. By February 2025, the bank's holdings\nincreased to 157,500 shares worth $5.37 million. President Trump owns approximately 53%\nof Trump Media through a trust controlled by Donald Trump Jr. The purchase by a foreign\ngovernment-controlled entity raises significant Emoluments Clause concerns given Trump's\nmajority ownership stake in the company. Another Swiss public financial institution,\nZürcher Kantonalbank, also owns 14,796 shares worth $237,000, further complicating\nthe potential constitutional conflict.\n",
