title: Fireworks CEO Provides $750K-$1M Gift After Trump Delays Tariffs
summary: Phantom Fireworks CEO Bruce Zoldan met with Trump in May 2019 to lobby against
  tariffs on Chinese fireworks. Shortly after, Zoldan's company provided an estimated
  $750,000-$1,000,000 in fireworks and services for Trump's "Salute to America" July
  4th event. The administration delayed imposing planned tariffs on fireworks around
  this period. Ethics watchdogs identified this as a glaring case of pay-to-play.
