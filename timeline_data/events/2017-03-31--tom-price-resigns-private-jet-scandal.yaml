title: HHS Secretary Tom Price Resigns After $1 Million Private Jet Scandal
summary: |
  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned after revelations he spent 
  over $1 million in taxpayer funds on private jets and military aircraft for travel 
  that included personal business. Price took at least 26 private charter flights 
  costing over $400,000, often to places where he had personal business or could 
  have flown commercially for a fraction of the cost. His resignation marked the 
  first Cabinet-level departure due to corruption scandal in the Trump administration, 
  setting a pattern of ethical violations that would plague multiple Cabinet members.

notes: |
  Price's corruption went beyond just the flights - he also traded healthcare stocks 
  while crafting healthcare legislation as a congressman. His resignation after just 
  231 days made him one of the shortest-serving HHS secretaries. Trump initially 
  defended Price but forced his resignation when the scandal became politically damaging. 
  Price offered to reimburse only $51,887 of the over $1 million spent.
