title: Executive Order 14171 reinstates 'Schedule F' in excepted service
summary: On Inauguration Day, President Trump signed EO 14171 directing OPM to re-create
  Schedule F (rebranded as "Schedule Policy/Career"), reclassifying up to 50,000 policy-influencing
  federal positions and stripping civil service protections to enable replacement
  with political appointees, reviving a 2020 proposal that had been rescinded in 2021.
