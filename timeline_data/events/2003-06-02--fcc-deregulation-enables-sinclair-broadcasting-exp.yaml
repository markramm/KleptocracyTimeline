title: FCC Deregulation Enables Sinclair Broadcasting Expansion
summary: The Bush administration's FCC under Chairman Michael Powell enabled massive
  media consolidation benefiting Sinclair Broadcasting through deregulation of ownership
  rules. The 2003 FCC vote to increase the national ownership cap from 35% to 45%
  particularly benefited Sinclair due to the UHF discount rule, which allowed stations
  on UHF frequencies to count as half their actual reachâ€”most Sinclair stations were
  UHF. This regulatory framework enabled Sinclair to operate 62 television stations
  by 2004 and implement unprecedented conservative programming mandates including
  must-run segments like 'Bottom Line with Boris' 9 times per week and synchronized
  conservative scripts across all stations. Despite 700,000+ public comments opposing
  deregulation (99% opposed), Powell's FCC prioritized corporate consolidation over
  media diversity. Congress later rolled back the cap to 39% in 2004 due to public
  outcry, but the UHF discount remained, creating the regulatory foundation that later
  enabled Sinclair's attempted 2017 Tribune Media acquisition that would have reached
  72% of U.S. households. The Bush-era deregulation transformed local news into centralized
  conservative messaging, with Sinclair using the trusted local news format for political
  propaganda through identical scripts and mandatory conservative commentary segments.
