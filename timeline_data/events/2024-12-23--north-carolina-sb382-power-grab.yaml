title: North Carolina Republicans Strip Governor's Power to Appoint Election Board
  Members
summary: North Carolina's SB 382, deceptively framed as "disaster relief," transferred
  power to appoint State Board of Elections members from Democratic Governor Josh
  Stein to Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek, effective May 2025. Unprecedented
  power grab enacted after Democrats won governorship. Governor Cooper and Governor-elect
  Stein filed suit December 23, 2024, citing constitutional violations. Law passed
  during lame duck session specifically to prevent incoming Democratic governor from
  appointing election oversight board. Represents systematic effort to control election
  machinery.
