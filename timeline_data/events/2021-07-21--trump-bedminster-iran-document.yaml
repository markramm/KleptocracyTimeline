title: Trump shows classified Iran attack plan at Bedminster, admits can't declassify
summary: |
  Audio recording captured Trump showing classified documents about U.S. attack plans on Iran
  to people without security clearances at his Bedminster golf club. Trump stated: "As
  president I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret."
  This admission proved Trump knew he retained classified material and lacked power to
  declassify it after leaving office, becoming key evidence in Jack Smith's prosecution.

  Meeting included writer and publisher working on Mark Meadows' memoir and two Trump staffers,
  none with security clearances. Trump was attempting to rebut claims about Mark Milley
  preventing him from attacking Iran. He described the document as "highly confidential" and
  "secret information." Later denied having documents in Fox News interview.
