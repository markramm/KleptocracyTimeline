  "title": "Trump Misses Transition Donor Disclosure Deadline, Declines Federal Funding",
  "summary": "President Trump missed the February 19 deadline to disclose private donors for his presidential transition, breaking a long-standing transparency practice. By declining federal funding of $19.4 million, Trump avoided requirements to cap donations at $5,000 per person and publicly list donor details.",
  "description": "Trump chose not to accept $19.4 million in federal transition funds, effectively avoiding mandatory donor disclosure requirements. The Presidential Transition Act typically requires detailed reporting of transition funding within 30 days of taking office, but Trump's team has not complied.",
