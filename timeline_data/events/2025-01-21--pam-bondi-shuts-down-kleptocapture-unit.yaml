description: Attorney General Pam Bondi, who received over $3 million from Trump businesses
  including Truth Social stock, shuts down FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force and
  DOJ's KleptoCapture unit on first day. Units had recovered billions in Russian oligarch
  assets and investigated foreign election interference. Bondi previously declined
  to investigate Trump University after receiving $25,000 illegal donation to her
  PAC.

notes: Bondi's immediate elimination of units investigating foreign influence and
  recovering oligarch assets signals administration's openness to foreign corruption.
  The KleptoCapture unit had recovered over $5 billion in Russian oligarch assets
  supporting Ukraine. The Foreign Influence Task Force investigated election interference
  and foreign lobbying violations. Their elimination removes key mechanisms for combating
  foreign corruption while Bondi herself has received millions from Trump businesses,
  creating massive conflicts of interest.
