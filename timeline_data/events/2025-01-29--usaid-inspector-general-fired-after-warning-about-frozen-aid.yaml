title: USAID Inspector General Fired After Warning About Frozen Aid Creating Half-Billion
  Dollar Loss
summary: USAID Inspector General Paul Martin was fired two weeks after issuing report
  warning that emergency aid freeze ordered by administration meant half a billion
  dollars in food aid might spoil or be stolen. Martin's firing came as part of broader
  pattern targeting watchdogs who issued unfavorable reports about administration
  policies.
description: Paul Martin issued a report documenting how the administration's freeze
  on foreign aid programs had stopped emergency assistance from moving, creating conditions
  where $500 million in food aid was at risk of spoilage or theft. Two weeks after
  the report, Martin was terminated along with other inspectors general. The firing
  demonstrated the administration's retaliation against oversight officials who documented
  negative consequences of policy decisions, particularly those affecting humanitarian
  programs.
