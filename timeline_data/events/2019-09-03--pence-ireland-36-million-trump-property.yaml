title: Pence's Ireland Trip Costs $3.6 Million with Detour to Trump Property
summary: Vice President Mike Pence's September 2019 stay at Trump Doonbeg in Ireland
  cost taxpayers $3.6 million total, requiring a 181-mile detour from Dublin meetings.
  Pence flew across Ireland to stay at Trump's golf resort rather than in Dublin where
  his official meetings occurred. The unnecessary detour enriched Trump's struggling
  Irish property while violating domestic emoluments principles through excessive
  taxpayer expenditure at presidential properties.

notes: Pence claimed Trump suggested the property. The 181-mile detour from Dublin
  meetings demonstrated prioritizing Trump's financial benefit over government efficiency
  and taxpayer interests.
