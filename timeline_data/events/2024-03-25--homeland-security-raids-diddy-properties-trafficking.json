  "title": "Homeland Security Launches Major Sex Trafficking Investigation Against Sean Combs",
  "summary": "Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) conducted simultaneous raids on Sean Combs' properties in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami as part of a comprehensive federal sex trafficking investigation. Federal prosecutors unveiled a three-count indictment alleging a decade-long criminal enterprise involving sexual exploitation, trafficking, and systematic abuse. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for prostitution.\n\nKey allegations include operating a criminal organization called the 'Combs Enterprise' that systematically abused and exploited women, including organizing elaborate 'Freak Offs' - orchestrated sexual performances involving commercial sex workers. The investigation revealed extensive electronic documentation and evidence of coercion, intimidation, and interstate transportation for sexual purposes.\n\nPotential sentences include life imprisonment for racketeering and sex trafficking charges, signaling the serious nature of the federal investigation.",
