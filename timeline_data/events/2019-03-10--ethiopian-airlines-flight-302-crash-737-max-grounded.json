  "date": "2019-03-10",
  "description": "Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people aboard due to the same MCAS system malfunction that caused the Lion Air crash. This second fatal incident within five months exposed the FAA's regulatory capture, as the agency had initially resisted grounding the aircraft until international pressure forced their hand on March 13, 2019.",
