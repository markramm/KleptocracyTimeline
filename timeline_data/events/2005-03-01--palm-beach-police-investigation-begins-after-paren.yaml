summary: Palm Beach Police Department begins investigating Jeffrey Epstein after a
  parent reports finding $300 in their 14-year-old daughter's room and learns it came
  from Epstein for a 'massage.' This marks the beginning of the law enforcement investigation
  that would eventually expose Epstein's systematic abuse of minors, though it would
  take years to overcome institutional protection.
