  "title": "Barre Seid Donates .6 Billion to Leonard Leo Dark Money Network",
  "summary": "Chicago businessman Barre Seid provides .6 billion to Leonard Leo's Marble Freedom Trust through opaque transactions, representing the largest known donation to a political advocacy group in U.S. history. This unprecedented infusion of dark money consolidates Leo's control over conservative legal and political networks, providing resources to \"crush liberal dominance\" in news, entertainment, and institutions. The donation transforms Leo from judicial kingmaker into broader conservative movement architect with billion-dollar resources to reshape American institutions beyond the courts.",
