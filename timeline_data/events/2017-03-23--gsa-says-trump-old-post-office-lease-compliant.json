  "title": "GSA deemed Trump Old Post Office lease 'compliant'; agency watchdog later faulted failure to consider Emoluments Clause",
  "summary": "On March 23, 2017, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced that its contracting\nofficer found the Trump Old Post Office LLC in compliance with the lease's Section 37.19\n(the \"no elected official\" clause). In January 2019, the GSA Inspector General reported that\nthe agency did not meaningfully evaluate the Constitution's Emoluments Clauses when issuing\nthat compliance determination, recommending a legal review. Congressional oversight hearings\nlater probed the discrepancy.\n",
  "notes": "Show both sides: (1) GSA's official compliance letter; (2) GSA OIG's finding that GSA failed to\nassess constitutional issues. Include the hearing record for additional context.\n",
