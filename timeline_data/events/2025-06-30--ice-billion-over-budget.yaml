title: ICE exceeds budget by $1 billion while claiming "cash crisis" for Pentagon funds
summary: ICE exceeded its budget by $1 billion by June 2025 while simultaneously claiming a "deep cash crisis" to justify emergency declarations redirecting Pentagon funds. The $170 billion enforcement budget represented a 400% increase, with funds flowing to politically-connected contractors through no-bid deals. The manufactured crisis enabled bypassing congressional appropriations to access military funding.

notes: Financial analysis showed ICE had sufficient funds through fiscal year but claimed crisis to access emergency military appropriations. The diverted Pentagon funds went directly to private contractors without competitive bidding.
