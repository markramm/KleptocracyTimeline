title: Trump Freezes Ukraine Military Aid Demanding Biden Investigation
summary: President Trump froze $391 million in congressionally approved military aid
  to Ukraine while pressuring President Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son
  Hunter. In a July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelensky 'I would like you to do us
  a favor though' immediately after Zelensky mentioned needing Javelin missiles to
  defend against Russia. Trump asked Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani and Attorney
  General Barr to investigate Biden, saying 'Biden went around bragging that he stopped
  the prosecution.' The aid freeze endangered Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression.
  A whistleblower complaint revealed the scheme, leading to Trump's first impeachment.
  The House voted 230-197 to impeach for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,
  though the Republican Senate acquitted 52-48. This marked the first time a president
  used military aid as leverage for personal political gain against a domestic rival.
