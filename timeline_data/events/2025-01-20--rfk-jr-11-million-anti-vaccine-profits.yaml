notes: Kennedy's appointment places an anti-vaccine activist with zero medical training
  in charge of America's health infrastructure. His $11.3 million anti-vaccine income
  and biotech investments create massive conflicts while overseeing FDA drug approvals
  and NIH research funding. Plans to fire 600 NIH employees and end water fluoridation
  demonstrate ideology over science. His Children's Health Defense spread vaccine
  misinformation linked to measles outbreaks, yet he now controls CDC vaccine policy.
