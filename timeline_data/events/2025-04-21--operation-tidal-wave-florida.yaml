summary: Operation Tidal Wave (April 21-26, 2025) resulted in 1,120 arrests across Florida, the largest number in a single state in one week in ICE's history. While ICE claimed all were "criminal aliens," 37% had no criminal convictions beyond immigration violations. Governor DeSantis and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan called it a "test run" and "warm up" for future operations. The operation utilized 287(g) agreements to integrate state and local law enforcement into immigration enforcement.
