title: Operation Tidal Wave arrests 1,120 in Florida with 37% having no criminal record
summary: Operation Tidal Wave (April 21-26) resulted in 1,120 arrests across Florida with 37% having no criminal record, explicitly described by DHS as "a preview" and political "model for other states." The operation targeted communities based on demographics rather than criminal activity, with Acting Director Todd Lyons calling community raids "direct response to sanctuary policies" despite Florida having no sanctuary jurisdictions.
