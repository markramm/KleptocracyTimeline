  "summary": "Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage booked approximately 500 rooms at \nTrump International Hotel in New York during his U.S. visit, generating significant \nrevenue at a time when the hotel was experiencing declining bookings. The stay \noccurred just days before the October 2, 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi \nat the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Trump's response to the Khashoggi murder was \nnotably muted, stating \"maybe he did, maybe he didn't\" regarding MBS's involvement, \nwhile emphasizing Saudi arms purchases and economic ties.\n",

  "notes": "The timing of these payments is critical - the Saudi government was funneling money \nto Trump's business while orchestrating the murder of a Washington Post journalist \nand U.S. resident. Trump's subsequent defense of MBS despite CIA conclusions about \nhis role in the murder demonstrates how foreign payments may have influenced U.S. \nforeign policy decisions. Trump repeatedly cited Saudi economic ties when defending \nthe kingdom.\n",
