  "notes": "GENIUS requires stablecoin issuers hold liquid asset reserves, grant coin holders bankruptcy priority. Subjects issuers to AML/sanctions compliance. No direct tax changes - IRS still treats crypto as property (Notice 2014-21). House also passed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (SEC/CFTC roles) and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Trump fulfilled campaign promise to make US \"crypto capital of the world.\" Bill legitimizes $3T crypto industry.",
