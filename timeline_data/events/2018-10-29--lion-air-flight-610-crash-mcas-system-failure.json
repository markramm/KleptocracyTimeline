  "date": "2018-10-29",
  "description": "Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people aboard. The crash was caused by a malfunctioning MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that repeatedly pushed the aircraft's nose down due to faulty angle-of-attack sensor data, a system that pilots were not informed about during training.",

  "summary": "A fatal aviation disaster revealing critical design flaws in Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft. The crash of Lion Air Flight 610 exposed systemic issues in aircraft design, maintenance, and pilot training, resulting from a malfunctioning Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). Investigators found multiple contributing factors, including miscalibrated sensors, inadequate pilot training, and Boeing's decision to obscure MCAS system details from flight manuals.",
