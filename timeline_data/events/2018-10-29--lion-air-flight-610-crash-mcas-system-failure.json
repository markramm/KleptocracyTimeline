  "description": "Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people aboard. The crash was caused by a malfunctioning MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that repeatedly pushed the aircraft's nose down due to faulty angle-of-attack sensor data, a system that pilots were not informed about during training.",
