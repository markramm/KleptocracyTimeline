  "date": "2002-08-26",
  "description": "The White House Iraq Group formalizes systematic media coordination infrastructure through regular meetings with television network executives, establishing pre-arranged booking protocols, talking point distribution systems, and synchronized messaging frameworks. This infrastructure enables coordinated propaganda campaigns like the September 8, 2002 'mushroom cloud' blitz by transforming disparate media outlets into a unified propaganda apparatus. Network executives agree to prioritize government access over journalistic independence, creating institutional mechanisms for systematic manipulation of public discourse.",
