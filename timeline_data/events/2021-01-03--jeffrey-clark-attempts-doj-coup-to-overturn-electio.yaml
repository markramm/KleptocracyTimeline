title: Jeffrey Clark Attempts DOJ Coup to Overturn Election
summary: Environmental lawyer Jeffrey Clark attempted to use the Department of Justice
  to overturn the 2020 election by sending false fraud letters to swing states. Clark
  drafted a letter falsely claiming DOJ had identified 'significant concerns' about
  the election and urging Georgia to convene a special legislative session to appoint
  Trump electors. When Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Deputy Richard Donoghue
  refused, Trump nearly appointed Clark as Acting AG on January 3. In an extraordinary
  White House meeting, DOJ leadership and White House counsel threatened mass resignations
  if Clark was installed, with Donoghue telling Trump 'you're going to get a completely
  incompetent person running the department.' Trump backed down only when warned the
  entire DOJ leadership would resign. Clark was later charged in Georgia's RICO case,
  had his law license suspended, and faced disbarment proceedings. His actions represented
  the closest attempt to weaponize DOJ to steal an election.
