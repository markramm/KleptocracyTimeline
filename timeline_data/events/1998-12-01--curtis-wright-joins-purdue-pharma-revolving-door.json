  "date": "1998-12-01",
  "description": "Dr. Curtis Wright IV, the FDA medical review officer who approved OxyContin in 1995, joins Purdue Pharma as Executive Director for Risk Assessment and Health Policy with a compensation package exceeding $379,000 annually. This move occurred less than three years after Wright overseen the controversial approval process where he allowed Purdue to help draft his medical officer's review and approved the misleading 'reduced abuse liability' label language. Wright's transition from regulator to regulated represents one of the most egregious examples of the pharmaceutical industry revolving door, raising serious questions about conflicts of interest in the FDA approval process that enabled the opioid epidemic.",
