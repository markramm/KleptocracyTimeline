  24-hour security surveillance requiring DPS escorts and "permission slips" to

notes: Democrats fled to Illinois, New York, Massachusetts to break quorum and block
  mid-decade redistricting ordered by Trump. Upon return, Speaker Burrows imposed
  unprecedented surveillance requiring "permission slips" signed by Speaker and
  mandatory DPS escorts to leave chamber. Collier filed habeas corpus petition
  calling restraint illegal. Maps would give GOP 30 of 38 Texas congressional
  seats. Represents escalation to police-state tactics against opposition.
