title: Sophisticated Swatting Campaign Targets Over 50 Congress Members in December
summary: Coordinated swatting campaign targeted over 50 members of Congress in December
  2024 alone, representing technologically enabled form of political violence that weaponizes
  law enforcement against political opponents. Romanian national Thomasz Szabo later
  pleaded guilty in June 2025 for leading international swatting network, revealing global
  dimensions of coordinated harassment campaigns. Swatting involves making false emergency
  calls to trigger armed police responses at targets' homes, creating life-threatening
  situations. Represents new evolution in political intimidation tactics using technology.
