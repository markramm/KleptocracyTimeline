title: Trump pardons financial criminals including wire fraud convict and money launderers
summary: President Trump issued pardons to multiple financial criminals in his first
  week, including a Trump loyalist convicted of wire fraud, a corporation fined $100
  million for money laundering violations, and the son of a longtime Republican donor.
  The pardons extended to Rod Blagojevich who had been convicted of corruption charges
  for attempting to sell Barack Obama's Senate seat. These pardons established a pattern
  of using presidential clemency power to protect financial criminals connected to
  Trump's political network.
