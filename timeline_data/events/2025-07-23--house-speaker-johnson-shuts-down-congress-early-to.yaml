title: House Speaker Johnson Shuts Down Congress Early to Block Epstein Files Vote
summary: House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly sends Congress into early summer recess
  on July 23, 2025, specifically to prevent a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency
  Act discharge petition led by Representatives Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna
  (D-CA). The petition had gained bipartisan momentum following public pressure for
  transparency about Jeffrey Epstein's connections. Johnson announced July 21 he would
  block any Epstein-related votes, then executed the early shutdown two days later.
