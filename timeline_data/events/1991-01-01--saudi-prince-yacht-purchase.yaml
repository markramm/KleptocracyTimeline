notes: The yacht was originally named "Nabila" and was purchased by Trump from the
  Sultan of Brunei in 1988 for $29 million, then renamed "Trump Princess." Prince
  Alwaleed renamed it "Kingdom 5KR" after purchase. Trump reportedly sailed on it
  only once - its maiden voyage from the Azores to New York harbor. In 1995, Prince
  Alwaleed would again rescue Trump by taking his 51% stake in the Plaza Hotel. This
  established a pattern of Saudi financial intervention during Trump's business crises,
  creating potential future conflicts of interest.
