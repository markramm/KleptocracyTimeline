title: During Title 42, unaccompanied children were held in hotels by contractors (e.g., Hampton Inn) before expulsion attempts
summary: Associated Press reporting in July and August 2020, along with litigation
  by the Texas Civil Rights Project, revealed DHS contractors held migrant children,
  some as young as 1, in hotels (including Hampton Inns) without standard childâ€‘welfare
  protections under the Title 42 expulsion policy. Court-appointed monitors documented
  these practices. Court action subsequently limited the practice, and children were
  transferred into ORR custody.
