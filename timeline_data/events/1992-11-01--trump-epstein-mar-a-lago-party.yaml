notes: The footage was shot by NBC for Faith Daniels' talk show "A Closer Look" profiling Trump's lifestyle after his divorce from Ivana. About 15-20 cheerleaders spent the night at Mar-a-Lago. The video was unearthed from NBC archives and aired publicly in July 2019 following Epstein's federal sex trafficking charges, contradicting Trump's later attempts to minimize their relationship.
