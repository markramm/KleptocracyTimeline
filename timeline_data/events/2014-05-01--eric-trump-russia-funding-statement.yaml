title: Eric Trump says all funding comes from Russia, not U.S. banks
summary: |
  Golf writer James Dodson reported that Eric Trump told him in 2014: "We don't rely on
  American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia." When asked about financing
  golf courses during the recession when banks weren't lending, Eric allegedly added they had
  "guys that really love golf" who were "really invested in our programmes." Eric Trump
  later denied making these statements in 2017.
