  (Maison de l'Amitié) for $95 million through his County Road Property LLC—more than 
  double what Trump paid in 2004. The sale occurs during the financial crisis when 
  property values were generally declining, raising questions about the transaction.

notes: The $95 million sale price was remarkably high given the 2008 financial crisis 
  when luxury real estate values were generally declining. Trump nearly doubled his 
  investment in four years during a period when most property values fell. The property 
  was later demolished and subdivided, with total sales exceeding $108 million.
