title: Rybolovlev Completes $95 Million Money Laundering Transaction Through Trump
summary: Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev purchased Trump's Palm Beach mansion for
  $95 million—a $55 million profit during the financial crisis—completing what Jeffrey
  Epstein documented as "a classic money laundering setup" with Trump "fronting for
  someone" who "didn't have $40 million lying around."

notes: This transaction exemplifies the systematic Russian money laundering through
  Trump real estate that Epstein documented, with continuing conspiracy aspects making
  it currently prosecutable despite occurring in 2008. Represents core evidence in
  what prosecutors could charge as continuing RICO conspiracy involving Trump Organization
  as criminal enterprise, with financial crimes remaining prosecutable through continuing
  concealment doctrines despite statute of limitations.
