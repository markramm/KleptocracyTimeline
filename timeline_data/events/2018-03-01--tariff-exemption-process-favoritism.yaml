title: Trump Tariff Exemption Process Shows Political Favoritism
summary: Academic study of over 7,000 tariff exemption requests finds firms with political
  connections to Trump, especially those donating to Trump or Republican causes, had
  significantly higher approval rates, while those linked to Democrats were more often
  denied. Internal government audits describe the 2018 exclusion program as "neither
  transparent nor objective," overwhelmed by lobbying and informal backdoor appeals.
