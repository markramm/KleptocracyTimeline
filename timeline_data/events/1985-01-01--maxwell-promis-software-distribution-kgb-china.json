  "summary": "Robert Maxwell begins systematic distribution of the weaponized PROMIS software with intelligence backdoors to foreign governments including the Soviet KGB and Chinese Military Intelligence (PLA-2). According to sworn affidavits, Maxwell sells China a copy of PROMIS for $9 million in 1985, revealing the software's 'trap door' secret. Working with Israeli Mossad operative Rafi Eitan, Maxwell ultimately distributes over $500 million worth of the surveillance-enabled PROMIS software to intelligence agencies worldwide, creating a global espionage network that allows Western intelligence to monitor foreign governments and organizations.",
