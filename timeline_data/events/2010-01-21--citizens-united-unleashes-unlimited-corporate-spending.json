  "title": "Supreme Court Citizens United Decision Unleashes Unlimited Corporate Spending",
  "summary": "Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that corporations can spend unlimited amounts on elections through independent expenditures, enabling creation of Super PACs and dark money networks. The decision dramatically reshaped campaign finance, allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on independent political expenditures, fundamentally altering the landscape of American electoral politics. Later investigations revealed substantial transparency issues, with ProPublica reporting that tracing donor identities became nearly impossible, potentially allowing corporations to leverage tax advantages through anonymous political donations.",
