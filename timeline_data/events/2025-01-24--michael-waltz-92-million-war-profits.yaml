notes: 'Waltz exemplifies military-industrial complex corruption: create wars as congressman,
  profit through contracting, then shape policy as NSA. His $92 million windfall from
  Metis Solutions came from $930 million in Afghanistan contracts secured while he
  advocated against withdrawal. The Signal security breach - adding journalist to
  classified military chat - shows dangerous incompetence with classified information.
  Now positioned to create new conflicts benefiting defense contractors who enriched
  him.'
