title: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Resigns Facing 18 Federal Investigations
summary: |
  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned while under at least 18 federal investigations 
  for corruption, conflicts of interest, and ethics violations. Scandals included: 
  involvement in a Montana land deal benefiting himself and Halliburton chairman, 
  using wildfire funds for personal travel, chartered flights costing $139,000, 
  reassigning employees who disagreed with him, meetings with donors during official 
  travel, and his wife using government vehicles. Zinke oversaw the largest reduction 
  of protected federal lands in U.S. history, shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-
  Escalante monuments to open them for mining and drilling.

notes: |
  Zinke's replacement, David Bernhardt, was an oil and gas lobbyist with so many 
  conflicts of interest he carried a card listing them. This exemplified the Trump 
  administration pattern of appointing industry insiders to dismantle the agencies 
  meant to regulate them. Zinke's reduction of national monuments was later found 
  to benefit uranium mining companies that had lobbied for the changes. He was the 
  fourth Trump Cabinet member to resign under ethics clouds.
