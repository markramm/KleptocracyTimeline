  "title": "Charles Keating Purchases Lincoln S&L: Systematic Fraud Network",
  "summary": "Charles Keating, through American Continental Corporation, purchases Lincoln Savings and Loan for $51 million. Exploiting the deregulated environment created by Garn-St Germain, Keating rapidly expands Lincoln's assets from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion over four years through high-risk real estate speculation and fraudulent bond sales. Keating coordinates a systematic influence network, providing $1.5 million in campaign contributions to five U.S. Senators (the \"Keating Five\") who later pressure regulators to overlook Lincoln's suspicious activities, demonstrating coordinated regulatory capture across legislative and executive branches.",
