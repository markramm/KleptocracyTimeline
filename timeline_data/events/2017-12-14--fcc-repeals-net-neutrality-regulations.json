  "summary": "The FCC voted along party lines to repeal Obama-era net neutrality regulations, eliminating rules that prevented internet service providers from blocking, slowing, or prioritizing web traffic. The decision shifts internet regulation from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission, potentially allowing ISPs to control internet access and speed based on financial agreements.",
