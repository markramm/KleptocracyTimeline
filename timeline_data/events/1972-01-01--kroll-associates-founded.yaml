title: Jules Kroll founds Kroll Associates, pioneering private intelligence industry
summary: Jules Kroll founded Kroll Associates in 1972 in New York, initially as a
  consultancy serving corporate purchasing departments before expanding into financial
  investigations in the 1980s. The firm earned the nickname "CIA of Wall Street" and
  "Wall Street's Private Eye" by systematically recruiting former CIA, FBI, Mossad,
  and MI5 employees, creating a private intelligence capability that paralleled government
  operations while serving corporate clients. French intelligence alleged it was a
  CIA front, establishing the template for the modern private intelligence industry.

notes: Kroll Associates demonstrated the commercial viability of private intelligence
  operations following post-Watergate reforms. The firm expanded beyond its 1972 founding
  into financial sector investigations in the 1980s when corporations approached them
  to profile investors and takeover targets. This established the template for modern
  private intelligence firms operating outside government restrictions.
