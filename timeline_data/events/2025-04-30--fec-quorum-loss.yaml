title: FEC Loses Policymaking Quorum After Commissioner Resignation
date: 2025-04-30
summary: Commissioner Allen Dickerson resigned on April 30, 2025, leaving the FEC
  with only three members and no quorum. Combined with Trump's February firing of
  Ellen Weintraub and Sean Cooksey's January resignation, the FEC cannot investigate
  complaints, conduct audits, levy fines, issue rules or advisory opinions, or hold
  meetings. This marks the fourth time in FEC history it lacks quorum, effectively
  shutting down campaign finance enforcement.

- Multiple outlets and law firms note enforcement shutdown following quorum loss
notes: Issue One noted "Without a quorum, the FEC is a watchdog without a bark or
  bite." Trump had not announced any appointments as of April 30, leaving campaign
  finance enforcement completely paralyzed. The FEC's last action before shutdown
  was fining Rep. Maxine Waters.
