title: Krome detention center operates at 300% capacity with severe human rights violations
summary: Krome detention facility operated at 300% capacity with 1,677 people crammed into space for 580, forcing detainees to sleep on feces-covered concrete floors and eat while shackled "like dogs." Senator Ossoff's investigation documented 510 credible abuse reports including 41 cases of physical/sexual abuse and 18 cases of child mistreatment. Despite court orders, conditions persisted as private contractors profited.
