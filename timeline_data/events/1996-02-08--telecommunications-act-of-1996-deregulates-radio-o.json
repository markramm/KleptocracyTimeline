  "title": "Telecommunications Act of 1996 Deregulates Radio Ownership, Enabling Media Consolidation",
  "summary": "President Clinton signs the Telecommunications Act of 1996 into law, fundamentally deregulating radio ownership and setting the stage for unprecedented media consolidation. The act eliminates the previous limit of 40 radio stations nationwide that any single company could own, opening the door for corporate media conglomerates to rapidly acquire hundreds of stations. Before this legislation, media ownership rules were designed to ensure diversity of viewpoints and prevent monopolization of local airwaves, with the belief that concentrated ownership would threaten democratic discourse. The act also removes restrictions on local market ownership, allowing companies to own multiple stations in the same market for the first time. Corporate interests and telecommunications lobbyists successfully convinced Congress that deregulation would increase competition and improve service, arguments that prove false as consolidation actually reduces competition and homogenizes content. The legislation passes with bipartisan support, reflecting the influence of corporate lobbying over democratic policymaking. Within months, companies like Clear Channel Communications begin aggressive acquisition campaigns that transform the radio industry. The act represents a classic example of regulatory capture, where the industries being regulated effectively write their own rules through legislative influence, prioritizing corporate profits over public interest in diverse, local media coverage.",
