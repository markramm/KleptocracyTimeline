notes: This meeting represents the beginning of Thiel's systematic cultivation of
  political talent aligned with his anti-democratic vision. Vance, then a Yale Law
  student from a working-class background, becomes Thiel's most successful political
  investment. The relationship demonstrates how tech billionaires build parallel power
  structures by identifying and funding ambitious individuals willing to advance their
  ideological agenda.
