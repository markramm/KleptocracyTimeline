title: Guidance to Georgia officials on mass voter challenges
summary: A coalition led by Campaign Legal Center, ACLU of Georgia, and other civil rights groups sent guidance to Georgia election officials on handling mass voter challenges under SB 189. The letter outlined legal concerns about baseless challenges based on unreliable data, reminded officials of federal NVRA limitations on voter purges, and provided best practices to prevent erroneous removal of eligible voters. This followed over 34,000 challenges filed immediately after SB 189 took effect July 1, 2024, with lawsuits subsequently filed to block the law's provisions.

notes: SB 189 allows challenges based on death records, past registration elsewhere, tax exemptions suggesting primary residence elsewhere, or P.O. box addresses. Within 90 days of the law taking effect, over 45,000 voter challenges were filed statewide. Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the law under NVRA and constitutional grounds.
