title: Deutsche Bank fined $630 million for $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme
summary: |
  Deutsche Bank paid $630 million to U.S. and UK regulators for facilitating $10 billion in
  Russian money laundering through "mirror trades" from 2011-2015. The scheme converted rubles
  to dollars through sham stock trades between Moscow and London offices. During this same
  period, Deutsche Bank was Trump's primary lender, providing $2.5 billion in loans while
  other banks refused. Compliance officers later flagged suspicious Trump and Kushner
  transactions to Russians, but executives overruled reporting them.

notes: |
  The bank paid $425 million to New York regulators and Â£163 million to UK authorities.
  Mirror trades involved fake stock transactions to convert rubles to dollars through
  offshore accounts in Cyprus and British Virgin Islands. While no direct Trump involvement
  proven, the timing overlapped with Trump receiving major loans when other banks refused.
