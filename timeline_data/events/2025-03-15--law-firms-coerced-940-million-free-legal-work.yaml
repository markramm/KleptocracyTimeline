title: Trump administration coerces law firms into $940 million of free legal work
summary: The Trump administration pressured major law firms to provide $940 million worth of free legal services to defend administration policies and officials. Firms were told that refusing to provide pro bono representation would result in losing all federal government contracts and being blacklisted from future work. Multiple firms reported receiving threats from White House officials demanding they assign top partners to defend controversial policies without compensation. This unprecedented extortion of the legal profession represented nearly a billion dollars in forced labor.
