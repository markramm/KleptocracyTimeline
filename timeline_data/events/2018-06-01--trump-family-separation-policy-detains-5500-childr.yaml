title: Trump Family Separation Policy Detains 5,500 Children in Cages
summary: The Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' family separation policy forcibly
  removed over 5,500 children from their parents at the border, detaining them in cages
  at facilities described as 'concentration camps' by historians. Children as young
  as 4 months were taken, with no tracking system to reunite families. Audio recordings
  captured children crying for their parents while guards mocked them. At least 7 children
  died in custody. The policy's architect, Stephen Miller, called it a deterrent despite
  knowing it violated international law. Documents revealed the administration knew
  it would separate families but proceeded anyway. Private prison companies CoreCivic
  and GEO Group profited billions from expanded detention contracts. Federal judges
  ordered reunification but over 1,000 children still remained separated by 2021. The
  UN Human Rights Office called it 'government-sanctioned child abuse.' Physicians
  for Human Rights documented lasting psychological trauma equivalent to torture.
