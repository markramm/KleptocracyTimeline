  "title": "Grand jury issues subpoena demanding all classified documents from Trump",
  "summary": "A federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring Trump to return all documents \"bearing\nclassification markings\" in his possession. This legal demand came after the National\nArchives discovered classified materials in boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's\nalleged failure to fully comply with this subpoena, including moving boxes to conceal\ndocuments from his attorney's search, became central to the obstruction charges filed\nagainst him in 2023.\n",

The indictment later\nalleged Trump directed boxes be moved before his attorney's June 2 search, ensuring the attorney\nwould not locate all responsive documents."
