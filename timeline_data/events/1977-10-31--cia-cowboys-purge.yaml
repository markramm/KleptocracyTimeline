notes: The purge followed congressional investigations into CIA abuses revealed during
  Watergate. Turner believed many officers were "still playing cowboy" outside proper
  controls. Of the 820 eliminated positions, 649 were cut through attrition, 154 through
  involuntary retirement, and 17 were directly fired. Some dismissed officers later
  moved to private security firms, though the major intelligence privatization surge
  would not occur until after 9/11. The cuts created significant institutional memory
  loss and ongoing tensions within the CIA.
