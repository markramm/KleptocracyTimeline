title: Brennan Center warns Georgia SB 189 spurs mass voter challenges
summary: The Brennan Center warned that Georgia's SB 189, effective July 1, 2024, dramatically
  eases third-party challenges to voter eligibility, enabling mass challenges based on unreliable
  data. The law requires local boards to hold hearings when there's "probable cause," specifically
  including known unreliable information sources. Within days of the law taking effect, activists
  filed over 34,000 challenges, with 89% of recent challenges coming from just six right-wing
  activists using tools like EagleAI and IV3. The law prevents challenges within 45 days of
  elections from being heard until after certification.

notes: SB 189 builds on Georgia's SB 202 from 2021. The law was immediately weaponized,
  with 243 challenges filed in Bibb County on day one. Tools like VoteRef, EagleAI,
  Check My Vote, and IV3 are being used to generate mass challenges across multiple states.
