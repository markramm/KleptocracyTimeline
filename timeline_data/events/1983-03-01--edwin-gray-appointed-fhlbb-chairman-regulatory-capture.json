  "title": "Edwin Gray Appointed FHLBB Chairman: Regulator from Industry",
  "summary": "Reagan appoints Edwin Gray as Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, exemplifying regulatory capture through appointment of a former thrift industry executive to oversee the industry. Gray initially reduces thrift examinations by 26% between 1981-1984, cuts regulatory staff, and lowers net worth requirements from 5% to 3%. Starting S&L examiner salaries are set at just 4,000 annually, with average examiner tenure of only 2 years. The OMB controls examiner funding rather than the FHLBB, creating institutional conflicts that favor industry over oversight.",
