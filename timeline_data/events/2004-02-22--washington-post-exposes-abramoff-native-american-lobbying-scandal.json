  "title": "Washington Post Exposes Abramoff Native American Lobbying Scandal",
  "summary": "The Washington Post published a groundbreaking investigation by journalist Susan Schmidt exposing the Jack Abramoff and Michael Scanlon lobbying scandal involving Native American tribal clients. The investigation revealed that the two lobbyists had charged six Native American tribes more than $82 million in fees and expenses over three years for lobbying and public relations work, often billing far more than the going rate for such services. Whistleblower Tom Rodgers had provided key documents to Schmidt in February 2004, spurring the investigation. The Post revealed that Abramoff and Scanlon had grossly overbilled tribal clients and were secretly splitting multi-million dollar profits through a complex kickback scheme. The article exposed how they charged the Louisiana Coushatta tribe over $30 million and other tribes similarly excessive amounts while providing questionable services. This investigation triggered federal criminal investigations and Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearings that would ultimately uncover one of the largest congressional corruption scandals in U.S. history.",
