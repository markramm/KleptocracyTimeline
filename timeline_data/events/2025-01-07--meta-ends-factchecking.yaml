date: '2025-01-07'
importance: 5
summary: Meta announced ending its third-party fact-checking program in the United
  States on January 7, 2025, replacing it with a "Community Notes" system where users
  write and rate notes about potentially misleading content. Mark Zuckerberg stated
  the previous system "too often became a tool to censor," with the change applying
  specifically to U.S. political content and phasing in over the following months,
  raising concerns about misinformation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
