  "notes": "Maps would flip 5 Republican-held seats Democratic, moving from 43-9 to 48-4 Democratic advantage in 52-seat delegation. Temporary measure through 2030 census, then returns to nonpartisan commission. Part of national redistricting war with 7 other states considering responsive map changes. Demonstrates escalating partisan warfare over congressional control.",
