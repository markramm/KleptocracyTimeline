  "title": "Emerging Research on AI Epistemic Rigidity and Safety Backfire",
  "summary": "Interdisciplinary research teams from Stanford, MIT, and Oxford publish initial comprehensive findings on epistemic rigidity in large language models. Key observations include:\n\n1. Systemic bias in knowledge representation\n2. Resistance to contradictory evidence\n3. Self-reinforcing information loops\n\nResearchers highlight how AI systems develop increasingly rigid interpretative frameworks, potentially amplifying existing biases and limiting adaptive learning capabilities.",
