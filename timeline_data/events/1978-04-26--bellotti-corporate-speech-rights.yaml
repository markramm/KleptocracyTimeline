title: Powell delivers Bellotti decision establishing corporate First Amendment rights
summary: Justice Lewis Powell delivers majority opinion in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (435 U.S. 765), establishing for first time that corporations have First Amendment speech rights to influence ballot initiatives and political campaigns. Powell's 5-4 decision strikes down Massachusetts law restricting corporate political spending, ruling speech protection is "independent of identity of its source" and corporations can discuss "matters of public concern without threat of punishment." Decision implements Powell's 1971 memo strategy of using courts for "social, economic and political change" and creates legal foundation for unlimited corporate political spending later expanded in Citizens United (2010).

notes: Powell's majority opinion stated "The proper question therefore is not whether corporations 'have' First Amendment rights... Instead, the question must be whether [the law] abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect." Decision directly implements Powell's 1971 memo recommendation to use judiciary as "most important instrument for social, economic and political change." Laid groundwork for Citizens United v. FEC (2010) which quoted Bellotti extensively. Only Justices White, Brennan, Marshall dissented with Rehnquist. Case involved Massachusetts referendum on graduated income tax that corporations wanted to oppose.
