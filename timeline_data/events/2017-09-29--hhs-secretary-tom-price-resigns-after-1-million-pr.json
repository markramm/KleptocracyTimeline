  "title": "HHS Secretary Tom Price Resigns After $1 Million Private Jet Scandal",
  "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned after revelations he spent \nover $1 million in taxpayer funds on private jets and military aircraft for travel \nthat included personal business. Price took at least 26 private charter flights \ncosting over $400,000, often to places where he had personal business or could \nhave flown commercially for a fraction of the cost. His resignation marked the \nfirst Cabinet-level departure due to corruption scandal in the Trump administration, \nsetting a pattern of ethical violations that would plague multiple Cabinet members.\n",

  "notes": "Price's corruption went beyond just the flights - he also traded healthcare stocks \nwhile crafting healthcare legislation as a congressman. His resignation after just \n231 days made him one of the shortest-serving HHS secretaries. Trump initially \ndefended Price but forced his resignation when the scandal became politically damaging. \nPrice offered to reimburse only $51,887 of the over $1 million spent.\n",
