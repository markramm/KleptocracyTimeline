title: NYT Reveals Bush NSA Warrantless Surveillance Program
summary: The New York Times revealed the Bush administration's secret warrantless
  surveillance program, exposing massive domestic spying without court approval. The
  President's Surveillance Program (codenamed 'Stellar Wind') began October 4, 2001,
  allowing NSA to monitor international phone calls and emails involving U.S. persons
  without FISA court warrants. The program surveilled up to 500 people simultaneously,
  requiring only 'reasonable basis' rather than 'probable cause' for targeting Americans.
  NSA collected telephone and internet metadata, conducted data mining of communications
  and financial transactions, and bypassed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
  established in 1978. The Bush administration justified the program using presidential
  war powers and the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Only 8 members
  of Congress were briefed on the program's existence. Justice Department attorney
  Thomas Tamm leaked the program to reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, who
  won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize. The revelation sparked intense debate about executive
  power versus civil liberties, leading to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 granting
  retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies.
