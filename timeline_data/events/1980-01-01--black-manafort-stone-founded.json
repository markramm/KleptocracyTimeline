  "summary": "Republican operatives Charlie Black, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone founded Black, Manafort & Stone in 1980, pioneering the modern lobbying industry. The firm became infamous as the 'Torturers' Lobby' for representing dictators including Ferdinand Marcos, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Jonas Savimbi. A 1992 Center for Public Integrity report detailed how the firm earned millions whitewashing brutal regimes while maintaining close ties to Republican administrations, with Donald Trump as their first client.",
