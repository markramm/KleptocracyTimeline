title: Kellyanne Conway Commits 50+ Hatch Act Violations, No Consequences
summary: White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway committed over 50 Hatch Act violations
  by repeatedly using her official position to influence elections, with the Office
  of Special Counsel finding she violated the law on dozens of occasions including
  advocating for Roy Moore and against Doug Jones in the Alabama Senate race. OSC recommended
  her removal from federal service, calling her violations 'egregious, notorious, and
  ongoing,' but Trump refused any disciplinary action. Conway appeared on TV in her
  official capacity attacking Democratic candidates and promoting Republicans. When
  asked about the violations, Conway said 'let me know when the jail sentence starts.'
  This normalized lawbreaking at the highest levels, with at least 13 senior Trump
  officials violating the Hatch Act including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and multiple
  Cabinet secretaries. The administration's refusal to enforce the law established
  that ethics rules were optional for those in power, fundamentally undermining government
  integrity.
