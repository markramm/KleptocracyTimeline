  "title": "Timothy Geithner Treasury Appointment Citigroup Conflicts",
  "summary": "Timothy Geithner confirmed as Treasury Secretary despite extensive conflicts with Citigroup during his tenure as NY Federal Reserve President. Maintained unusually close relationships with Citi executives including mentor Robert Rubin, having dozens of meetings in 2007-2008 - more than with any other firm. As Fed President, eased regulatory oversight allowing Citi to blow billions on subprime mortgages requiring largest bank rescue in US history. Later slow-walked direct presidential order to prepare Citigroup breakup, instead engineering multiple bailouts through Fed loans and guarantees.",
