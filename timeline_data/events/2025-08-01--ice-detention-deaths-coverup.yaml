title: ICE covers up 12+ detention deaths while private contractors profit
summary: At least 12 documented deaths occurred in ICE detention facilities in 2025, with systematic coverups preventing accurate counting. Deaths resulted from medical neglect, suicide, violence, and heat exposure. Despite violations causing deaths, private detention contractors continued receiving full payments with no penalties. CoreCivic and GEO Group stocks reached all-time highs as death counts mounted.
