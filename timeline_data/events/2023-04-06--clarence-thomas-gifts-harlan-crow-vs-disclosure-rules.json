  "title": "ProPublica reveals decades of luxury travel/gifts to Justice Thomas; 2023 Judicial Conference narrows hospitality exemption",
  "summary": "ProPublica documented years of undisclosed luxury travel and gifts for Justice Clarence Thomas\nfrom billionaire Harlan Crow and other benefactors. In March 2023, the Judicial Conference\nclarified that \"personal hospitality\" does not exempt disclosure of non-commercial transportation\n(e.g., private jets) and hospitality paid by entities. Thomas later amended disclosures acknowledging\nomissions; federal courts declined referral for prosecution while citing prior staff guidance ambiguity.\n",
  "notes": "Present both investigative findings and the judiciary's evolving disclosure guidance. Include\nThomas's subsequent amended filings and SCOTUSBlog's coverage of the non-referral and guidance dispute.\n",
