title: One Big Beautiful Bill Act Transfers $3.4 Trillion Upward Through Tax Cuts
  and Slush Funds
summary: Trump's signature budget reconciliation bill increases federal deficits by
  $3.4 trillion over 10 years while transferring wealth upward, with 65% of benefits
  flowing to top 10% of earners. Creates multiple opaque funding streams including
  $100M OMB slush fund for "efficiencies" and $10B DHS border fund with minimal oversight.
  Permanently extends 2017 tax cuts, expands pass-through deduction to 23%, and raises
  estate tax exemption to $15 million, directly benefiting Trump Organization structure.

notes: Bill provides $170 billion in immigration enforcement through reconciliation
  to avoid oversight, creates "significant discretion" for agencies per CBO. Committee
  for Responsible Federal Budget called accounting gimmicks "would make Enron executives
  blush."
