title: Ninth Circuit stays district court order on LA deployment
date: '2025-06-19'
importance: 10
summary: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a district court order on June
  19, 2025, that had found the Trump administration's military deployment to Los Angeles
  likely violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The stay allowed federal troops and federalized
  National Guard to remain deployed in LA while the administration appealed, despite
  the lower court finding the deployment constituted unlawful use of military for
  domestic law enforcement.

  lower court finding likely Posse Comitatus violations. Part of broader pattern of
  courts enabling administration's domestic military deployments.
