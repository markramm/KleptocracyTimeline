notes: This represents the most direct example of regulatory capture in presidential
  history, where the chief executive dismantled federal enforcement targeting the
  exact industry generating his family's wealth through foreign investment channels.
  Dissolution represents complete regulatory capture where presidential conflicts
  of interest led to dismantling of federal law enforcement mechanisms designed to
  prevent exactly the crypto-enabled corruption patterns Trump's ventures exemplify.
