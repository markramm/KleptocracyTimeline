notes: This event exemplifies how cryptocurrency enables foreign nationals to make
  direct payments to sitting president while obscuring the transaction's nature and
  gaining unprecedented access to White House policy-making. Direct payment from Chinese
  national under federal investigation to sitting president, followed by immediate
  White House access and favorable regulatory treatment, represents textbook emoluments
  violation and potential obstruction of justice.
