title: Justin Sun Becomes First White House Crypto Dinner Guest After $75 Million
  Investment
summary: Chinese crypto billionaire Justin Sun invested $75 million in Trump's World
  Liberty Financial (75% of proceeds go to Trump family as fees, netting them ~$56 million)
  and over $20 million in $TRUMP memecoin, totaling $93+ million in Trump crypto ventures.
  Sun attended a May 2025 black-tie gala at Trump's Virginia golf club where he received
  a $100,000 Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. The SEC paused its 2023 fraud charges against
  Sun after his investment announcement.

notes: Sen. Richard Blumenthal called this "an unprecedented, pay-to-play scheme to provide
  access to the presidency to the highest bidder." Bloomberg analysis showed most top
  $TRUMP holders used foreign exchanges off-limits to US residents. The Trump family
  directly earned up to $56 million from Sun's investment through their 75% fee structure.
  SEC mysteriously paused fraud case after Sun's investment, suggesting quid pro quo.
