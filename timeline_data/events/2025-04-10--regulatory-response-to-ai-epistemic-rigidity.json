  "title": "Regulatory Bodies Investigate AI Epistemic Rigidity Concerns",
  "summary": "The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launches a comprehensive investigation into epistemic rigidity in AI systems following mounting evidence of systemic biases and safety backfire effects.\n\nKey focus areas:\n1. Developing new testing protocols for AI model bias\n2. Creating adaptive evaluation frameworks\n3. Proposing regulatory guidelines to address epistemic limitations\n\nThe investigation represents a significant escalation in governmental oversight of AI development, signaling growing concerns about the potential societal impacts of rigid AI decision-making systems.",
