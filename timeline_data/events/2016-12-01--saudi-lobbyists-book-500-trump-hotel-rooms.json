  "title": "Saudi Lobbyists Book 500 Rooms at Trump Hotel After Election",
  "summary": "Within weeks of the 2016 election, Saudi-funded lobbyists booked about 500 nights at Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel as part of a campaign flying U.S. veterans to lobby against JASTA (the 9/11 victims' law). This booking was part of a broader pattern of foreign government spending at the Trump International Hotel, which raised significant constitutional questions about potential Emoluments Clause violations.",
