notes: Raid began 7 AM with 10 FBI agents, continued until 1:40 PM. Investigation
  targets Bolton's 2020 memoir "The Room Where It Happened" which Biden DOJ had
  cleared and dropped lawsuit over in 2021. Patel tweeted "NO ONE is above the
  law" during raid. Trump claimed ignorance but called Bolton "real lowlife."
  Represents weaponization of FBI against prominent Trump critic using previously
  settled classified documents as pretext.
