title: Trump Issues Mass Pardons to 1,500 January 6 Defendants Including Violent Offenders
summary: President Trump pardoned approximately 1,500 January 6 defendants on his
  first day in office, including violent offenders who assaulted police officers.
  Pardoned Proud Boys leaders like Enrique Tarrio returned to public activism, with
  Joe Biggs describing their CPAC reception as "we're like Gods." Multiple pardoned
  defendants re-arrested within weeks for new crimes including domestic violence and
  burglary. Others filed $100 million lawsuits against DOJ claiming wrongful prosecution.
  Mass pardons sent unprecedented signal that political violence carries no consequences
  if aligned with right cause, marking watershed moment in normalization of violence.
