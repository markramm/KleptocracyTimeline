title: Trump appears in Epstein aircraft logbooks multiple times (DOJ exhibits)
summary: Department of Justice exhibits from U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell include
  Epstein aircraft logbooks showing Donald Trump's name on several domestic flights
  in the 1990s, primarily between Florida and New York. Media tallies commonly count
  seven or more such entries; there is no evidence of travel to Epstein's private
  island, and logs do not establish criminal conduct.

  entries document names and dates but are not evidence of wrongdoing.
