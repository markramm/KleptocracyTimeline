  "title": "During Sprint merger review, T-Mobile executives spent ~$195,000 at Trump's D.C. hotel",
  "summary": "While seeking federal approval of the T-Mobile–Sprint merger, T-Mobile executives sharply increased spending at Trump International Hotel in Washington—about $195,000 on rooms, meeting space, and services—according to company letters and reporting. The company said the stays did not affect the merger's review. T-Mobile executives began extensively patronizing the Trump Hotel immediately after announcing their merger with Sprint, raising significant conflicts of interest concerns that prompted congressional investigation and oversight.",
  "notes": "Use company letter figures reported by Reuters and the Washington Post; note that the FCC/DOJ approvals proceeded separately, but the patronage raised conflict-of-interest concerns.",
