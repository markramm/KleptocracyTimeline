title: Bush Valentine Day Massacre Fires Two Inspector Generals
summary: President Bush fired two experienced Inspector Generals on Valentine's Day
  2002 in what became known as the 'Valentine's Day Massacre,' undermining federal
  oversight independence. Louise Jordan, Inspector General at Corporation for National
  and Community Service, and Roberta Gross, NASA Inspector General with 7 years experience
  battling cost overruns, were both dismissed on February 14, 2002. The firings were
  handled so poorly they appeared to be personal or political payback, creating lasting
  concerns about political interference with oversight functions. Bush's broader approach
  involved systematic appointment of political loyalists rather than mass firingsâ€”a
  2004 House Government Reform Committee report found 43 Bush-appointed inspectors
  general had highly politicized backgrounds, with over 60% having prior political
  experience compared to less than 25% under Clinton. More than one-third had worked
  in the Bush White House. The 2002 firings sent a clear intimidation message to other
  IGs about political interference, effectively undermining inspector general independence
  for the remainder of the administration. The scandal ultimately led to enhanced
  protections in the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, requiring 30-day Congressional
  notice for IG removals.
