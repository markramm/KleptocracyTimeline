notes: |
  Thiel's RNC speech represents watershed moment in tech-politics alignment, legitimizing Trump among Silicon Valley elite while providing Trump movement with intellectual and financial backing. Speech focuses on American decline narrative and need for disruption, avoiding social issues while emphasizing technological stagnation under current system. This public endorsement precedes Thiel's broader project of funding anti-establishment candidates like J.D. Vance who share his vision of dismantling democratic constraints on capital.
