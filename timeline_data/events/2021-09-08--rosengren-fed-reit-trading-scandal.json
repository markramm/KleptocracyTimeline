  "title": "Boston Fed President Rosengren REIT Trading Scandal Exposed",
  "summary": "Bloomberg reveals Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren made multiple purchases and sales in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and mortgage-backed securities during 2020 while publicly warning about commercial real estate market contagion risks. Rosengren's trades in real estate funds directly conflicted with his public warnings and his role setting Federal Reserve policy on mortgage-backed security purchases during pandemic crisis, demonstrating systematic regulatory capture where Fed officials profit from markets they regulate.",
