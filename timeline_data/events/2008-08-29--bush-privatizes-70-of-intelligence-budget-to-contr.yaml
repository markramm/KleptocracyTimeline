title: Bush Privatizes 70% of Intelligence Budget to Contractors
summary: By 2008, the Bush administration had privatized 70% of the intelligence budget
  to private contractors, creating a 'shadow intelligence community' with unprecedented
  corporate access to classified information. Associate DNI Ronald Sanders confirmed
  that 37,000 'core' intelligence contractors represented 27% of the intelligence
  community workforce, with companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, SAIC, and CACI gaining
  dominant positions. Intelligence spending grew dramatically post-9/11, with the
  National Intelligence Program reaching 7.5 billion by 2008 and over 00 billion spent
  from 2001-2013. Half of Booz Allen's 25,000 employees held top secret clearances,
  while SAIC ran major NSA programs including the failed + billion Trailblazer project.
  The privatization created security vulnerabilities exposed when Edward Snowden,
  a Booz Allen contractor, leaked classified NSA documents in 2013. A revolving door
  emerged between government and contractors, with figures like Mike McConnell moving
  from NSA Director to Booz Allen to DNI and back to Booz Allen. This transformation
  moved U.S. intelligence from primarily government-operated to majority contractor-operated
  within a single decade, undermining democratic accountability of core national security
  functions.
