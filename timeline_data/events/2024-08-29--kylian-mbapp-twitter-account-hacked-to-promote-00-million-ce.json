  "summary": "Soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé's official X (Twitter) account was compromised in a sophisticated crypto scam on August 29, 2024. Hackers used his 14.4 million follower account to launch a fraudulent $MBAPPE token on the Solana blockchain, which rapidly reached a $464 million market cap before crashing to near-zero within minutes. The incident represents an advanced evolution of celebrity social media account hijacking for cryptocurrency fraud, where hackers directly exploit high-profile accounts instead of traditional celebrity endorsements.",
