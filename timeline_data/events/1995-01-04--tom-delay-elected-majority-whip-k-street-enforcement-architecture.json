  "title": "Tom DeLay Elected Majority Whip - Creates K Street PAC Tracking System",
  "summary": "Following the Republican Revolution, Tom DeLay is elected House Majority Whip and implements systematic lobbying control mechanisms. DeLay creates the notorious 'friendly/unfriendly' PAC classification system, maintaining a notebook tracking which of the 400 largest PACs contribute to Republicans vs Democrats. This becomes the enforcement mechanism for the K Street Project, with DeLay telling lobbyists: 'If you want to play in our revolution, you have to live by our rules.' The system fundamentally transforms Washington lobbying by creating explicit pay-to-play requirements.",
