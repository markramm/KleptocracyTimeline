title: Noem reveals she killed 14-month-old dog and goat in memoir
summary: In her memoir "No Going Back," Kristi Noem wrote about shooting her 14-month-old
  dog Cricket and a goat on her ranch 20 years ago. She described Cricket as "untrainable"
  after the dog attacked chickens and attempted to bite her. She then shot a goat
  because it smelled bad and knocked down her children. Noem defended the killings
  as examples of making tough leadership decisions, severely damaging her VP prospects.
