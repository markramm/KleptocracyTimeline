title: Trump allegedly orders deletion of Mar-a-Lago surveillance footage
summary: |
  Carlos De Oliveira told a Trump employee in Mar-a-Lago's audio closet that "the boss"
  wanted the surveillance server deleted after DOJ subpoenaed footage on June 24. De Oliveira
  and Walt Nauta had inspected cameras on June 25, walking through tunnels with flashlights.
  This alleged deletion attempt, occurring after FBI agents visited to collect classified
  documents, led to additional obstruction charges in the superseding indictment against
  Trump, Nauta, and De Oliveira.

notes: |
  De Oliveira, a 20-year Trump employee who became property manager in January 2022, asked
  about server retention period (45 days) before requesting deletion. He later lied to FBI
  in January 2023 interview, saying he "never saw nothing" regarding boxes. This brought
  total charges against Trump to 40 counts.
