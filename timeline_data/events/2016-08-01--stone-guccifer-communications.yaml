notes: Direct evidence of Stone coordination with Russian military intelligence. First
  time anyone in Trump's orbit acknowledged contact with a hacker that claimed responsibility
  for hacking the DNC. July 2018 Mueller indictment states Russian officers posing
  as Guccifer 2.0 "wrote a person who was in regular contact with senior members"
  of Trump campaign, matching Stone's messages.
