title: Trump Plans Massive Tariffs Amid Market Manipulation Concerns
summary: Trump's plans for massive tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and the EU raised
  concerns about insider trading. Observers warned that if insiders shorted the market
  knowing a tariff shock was coming, "they could make billions off of a deliberately
  engineered economic downturn." Trump simultaneously purged independent regulators
  and installed loyalists in agencies like SEC and DOJ, heightening concerns about
  unchecked insider trading.
