  "title": "Powell Memorandum Establishes Blueprint for Conservative Think Tank Strategy",
  "summary": "Lewis F. Powell Jr. delivers his confidential memorandum \"Attack on American Free Enterprise System\" to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, providing the strategic blueprint for corporate political mobilization. The 34-page document outlines how business should systematically defend against perceived anti-corporate sentiment through \"careful long-range planning,\" coordinated financing, and creation of intellectual infrastructure. Powell emphasizes the need for \"highly qualified scholars\" and organizations with \"national reputation\" to counter what he sees as threats to the free enterprise system. This memorandum directly inspires the creation of conservative think tanks including the Heritage Foundation and becomes the foundational document for the modern conservative movement's institutional strategy. The memo leads to dramatic business mobilization: corporate PACs increase from under 300 in 1976 to over 1,200 by 1980, and corporations with Washington public affairs offices grow from 100 in 1968 to over 500 in 1978.",
