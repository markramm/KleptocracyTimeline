  "summary": "ICE contractor MVM Inc. detained Valentina Galvis and her infant son at the Sonesta O'Hare hotel in Chicago for five days in June 2025, continuing the practice of using commercial hotels as unofficial detention centers. MVM employee JoAnna Granado transported them from the hotel. Investigation revealed MVM regularly maintains rooms at Sonesta hotels in Atlanta and Los Angeles as well, suggesting a widespread network of hotel-based detention operating outside standard oversight. This practice violates detention standards requiring proper facilities and allows ICE to circumvent congressional oversight laws.",

  "notes": "The use of airport hotels allows ICE and its contractors to detain immigrants in locations not subject to detention facility standards or congressional oversight visits. Staff at multiple Sonesta properties acknowledged MVM's regular presence, indicating a systematic practice. This shadow detention network operates parallel to official ICE facilities, making it impossible for Congress to conduct oversight as these locations are not on any official detention facility lists.",
