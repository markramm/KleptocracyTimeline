title: Private Prison Stocks Soar as CoreCivic, GEO Donate $2.8M to Trump
summary: Private prison companies CoreCivic and GEO Group saw their stock prices surge
  100% and 98% respectively after donating nearly $2.8 million to Trump's campaign
  and inauguration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions immediately reversed Obama's order
  to phase out private prisons, declaring 'this will restore BOP's flexibility.' The
  companies secured $45 billion in detention contracts as the administration implemented
  family separation policies that increased detention needs. GEO Group moved its annual
  conference to Trump National Doral, paying the Trump Organization directly. CoreCivic
  and GEO spent $1.6 million lobbying in 2017 alone. ICE detention in private facilities
  increased 40% while conditions deteriorated, with 24 deaths in custody during Trump's
  term. Both companies' executives gained direct White House access through Mar-a-Lago
  memberships. The quid pro quo demonstrated how campaign contributions directly translated
  into billion-dollar government contracts.
