title: DHS rescinds 'protected areas' memorandum
date: '2025-01-20'
summary: Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine Huffman rescinded Biden's 2021 "protected areas" policy
  on January 20, 2025, eliminating restrictions on immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals,
  churches, playgrounds, shelters, and disaster sites. The new directive gives ICE agents
  "common sense" discretion for enforcement anywhere. DHS stated "Criminals will no longer be
  able to hide in America's schools and churches." On January 31, ICE Acting Director Vitello
  issued guidance for case-by-case determinations. Healthcare facilities lost protection,
  raising concerns about public health impacts.
