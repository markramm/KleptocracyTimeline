  "title": "Cambridge Analytica Facebook Scandal Exposes Systematic Digital Information Warfare Infrastructure Evolution from WHIG Media Coordination Template",
  "summary": "The Guardian and New York Times revelation that Cambridge Analytica harvested 87 million Facebook profiles for political manipulation exposes the systematic evolution of information control systems from WHIG's episodic media coordination to comprehensive digital information warfare infrastructure enabling systematic democratic manipulation. The scandal reveals how WHIG's template for coordinated propaganda distribution evolved into algorithmic psychological targeting systems where social media platforms systematically manipulate democratic processes through psychographic profiling, micro-targeting, and cognitive manipulation at unprecedented scale. Cambridge Analytica's systematic deployment of 'surveillance capitalism' for political manipulation demonstrates the acceleration of WHIG information coordination template: instead of requiring coordinated media booking and synchronized messaging, digital platforms now enable systematic democratic manipulation through algorithmic control systems that automatically target and influence voters based on psychological vulnerabilities. The scandal exposes systematic information warfare infrastructure where private corporations systematically control democratic information processes through technological platforms that bypass constitutional protections for democratic discourse, First Amendment guarantees, and equal access to information necessary for democratic decision-making. This represents the culmination of WHIG information control evolution: systematic technological infrastructure enabling ongoing democratic manipulation without requiring crisis conditions or coordinated human propaganda campaigns.",
