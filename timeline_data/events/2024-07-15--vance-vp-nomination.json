  "notes": "Vance's selection as VP represents Peter Thiel's greatest political victory, placing his hand-picked candidate one heartbeat from presidency. The selection validates Thiel's long-term strategy of identifying, funding, and elevating ideologically aligned politicians to dismantle democratic institutions from within. Vance's journey from Yale Law student to VP in 13 years, entirely facilitated by Thiel's money and mentorship, establishes new template for oligarchic political control. His presence on ticket signals tech-authoritarian capture of Republican Party."
