title: Saudi Crown Prince's Entourage Books Trump Hotel During Khashoggi Crisis
summary: |
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's entourage booked approximately 500 rooms at 
  Trump International Hotel in New York during his U.S. visit, generating significant 
  revenue at a time when the hotel was experiencing declining bookings. The stay 
  occurred just days before the October 2, 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
  at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Trump's response to the Khashoggi murder was 
  notably muted, stating "maybe he did, maybe he didn't" regarding MBS's involvement, 
  while emphasizing Saudi arms purchases and economic ties.

notes: |
  The timing of these payments is critical - the Saudi government was funneling money 
  to Trump's business while orchestrating the murder of a Washington Post journalist 
  and U.S. resident. Trump's subsequent defense of MBS despite CIA conclusions about 
  his role in the murder demonstrates how foreign payments may have influenced U.S. 
  foreign policy decisions. Trump repeatedly cited Saudi economic ties when defending 
  the kingdom.
