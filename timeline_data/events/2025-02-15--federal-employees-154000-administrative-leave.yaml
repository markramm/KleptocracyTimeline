notes: The Deferred Resignation Program represents a calculated strategy to accelerate
  the replacement of career civil servants with political loyalists. By placing 154,000
  employees on paid administrative leave while they await buyouts, the administration
  effectively removes institutional knowledge and expertise while maintaining the
  fiction of voluntary departures. Combined with the 59,000 jobs already eliminated
  and Schedule F reclassifications, this creates space for wholesale replacement of
  the federal workforce with politically aligned appointees. The scale exceeds any
  previous administration's workforce changes.
