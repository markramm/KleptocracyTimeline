title: Commerce Department changes broadband policies benefiting Starlink up to $20B
summary: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick overhauled the $42.5B BEAD broadband program
  to adopt "tech-neutral approach" allowing satellite providers like Starlink to receive
  $10-20B instead of expected $4.1B, while directing staff to "increase satellite
  usage regardless of other considerations" and specifically recommending Elon Musk's
  Starlink to rural broadband leaders.
