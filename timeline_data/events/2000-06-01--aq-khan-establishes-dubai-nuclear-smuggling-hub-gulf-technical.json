  "title": "A.Q. Khan Establishes Dubai Nuclear Smuggling Hub Through Gulf Technical Industries",
  "summary": "A.Q. Khan's nuclear smuggling network established Gulf Technical Industries as a front company in Dubai, creating the primary transshipment hub for nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Peter Griffin set up the Dubai-based shell company in June 2000, which B.S.A. Tahir would use to order centrifuge components from Malaysian factories and coordinate shipments through UAE ports. Khan himself maintained a penthouse on Dubai's al-Maktoum Road and made 41 trips to Dubai from 1999 onwards according to Pakistan government records. The Dubai hub utilized UAE's free trade zones and minimal oversight to create what intelligence agencies later described as nuclear proliferation 'factories' consisting of 'a fax machine and an empty office' that would facilitate illegal shipments and shut down immediately after deals were completed. This operation demonstrated the fundamental vulnerability of UAE port infrastructure that would later become central to the 2006 Dubai Ports World controversy, as the same ports used for nuclear smuggling were proposed for management by UAE-controlled companies.",
