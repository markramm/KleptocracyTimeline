  "description": "Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins announces elimination of 72,000 VA jobs - 15% of workforce - while claiming \"no cuts to benefits\" despite these workers directly providing veteran healthcare and services. Cuts target medical staff, claims processors, and mental health counselors serving 9 million veterans. Collins previously voted against expanding VA healthcare while in Congress.",

  "notes": "Collins's claim of \"no cuts to benefits\" while eliminating 72,000 jobs providing those benefits exemplifies administration doublespeak. The 15% workforce reduction targets the exact employees delivering healthcare, processing disability claims, and providing mental health services to 9 million veterans. This follows pattern of claiming to support veterans while systematically dismantling the infrastructure serving them. Collins's congressional record of opposing VA expansion reveals long-term hostility to veteran services."
