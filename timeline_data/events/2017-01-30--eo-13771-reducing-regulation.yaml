title: 'Executive Order 13771: Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs'
summary: Trump signed EO 13771 on January 30, 2017, establishing a "two-for-one" rule requiring agencies to eliminate two existing regulations for every new regulation, with zero net cost increase. A November 2017 OIRA report claimed agencies achieved a 22-to-1 deregulatory ratio in eight months, saving $8.1 billion. Public Citizen and others sued but were dismissed for lack of standing. Biden rescinded the order on his first day in office, January 20, 2021.
