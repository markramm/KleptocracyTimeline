title: Goldman Sachs Alumni Take Control of Trump Economic Policy
summary: Despite campaign rhetoric opposing Wall Street, Trump appointed an unprecedented
  concentration of Goldman Sachs executives to key positions. Gary Cohn, who received
  a $285 million severance from Goldman, became National Economic Council Director.
  Steven Mnuchin, a 17-year Goldman partner who initially failed to disclose $95 million
  in assets, became Treasury Secretary. Dina Powell served as Deputy National Security
  Adviser. Jay Clayton, longtime Goldman attorney, chaired the SEC. Even Steve Bannon
  and Anthony Scaramucci had Goldman backgrounds. Critics dubbed the administration
  'Government Sachs' as these appointees rolled back Dodd-Frank regulations and reduced
  SEC enforcement against financial institutions.
