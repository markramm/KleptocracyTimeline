  "title": "Bondi Fires 20 Justice Department Employees Tied to Trump Prosecutions",
  "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi fires 20 additional Justice Department employees specifically identified for their involvement in prosecuting Trump, including prosecutors who worked on January 6th cases and classified documents investigation. The targeted firings represent continuation of systematic purge designed to eliminate any DOJ personnel who participated in investigating or prosecuting Trump. The systematic targeting demonstrates institutional capture where Justice Department personnel decisions are based on loyalty to Trump rather than professional qualifications or legal expertise. Bondi's systematic elimination of prosecutors creates precedent for political control over career law enforcement officials, weaponizing DOJ hiring and firing to serve presidential political interests.",
