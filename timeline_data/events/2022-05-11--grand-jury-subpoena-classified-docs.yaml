title: Grand jury issues subpoena demanding all classified documents from Trump
summary: |
  A federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring Trump to return all documents "bearing
  classification markings" in his possession. This legal demand came after the National
  Archives discovered classified materials in boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's
  alleged failure to fully comply with this subpoena, including moving boxes to conceal
  documents from his attorney's search, became central to the obstruction charges filed
  against him in 2023.

notes: |
  Trump's team requested deadline extension and raised claims about presidential declassification
  authority without asserting Trump had actually declassified the documents. The indictment later
  alleged Trump directed boxes be moved before his attorney's June 2 search, ensuring the attorney
  would not locate all responsive documents.
