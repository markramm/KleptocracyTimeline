title: U.S. pauses enforcement of foreign official bribery laws
summary: Trump signed an executive order on February 10, 2025, "Pausing Foreign Corrupt
  Practices Act Enforcement," directing DOJ to cease all new FCPA investigations and
  review existing cases. AG Pam Bondi had already issued a February 5 memo prioritizing
  only cartel-related foreign bribery. The AG has 180-360 days to create new guidelines
  to "restore proper bounds" and "prioritize American interests." The order doesn't
  affect SEC civil enforcement or other bribery laws. During Trump's first term, DOJ
  reached some of the largest-ever FCPA settlements, and 2024 was a "banner year"
  for enforcement, making this reversal particularly significant.

notes: Enables U.S. companies to engage in previously illegal foreign corruption during
  pause. Five-year statute of limitations means violations could still be prosecuted
  by future administrations. Foreign governments' anti-bribery laws still apply.
