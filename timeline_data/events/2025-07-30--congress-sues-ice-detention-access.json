  "title": "Twelve House Democrats sue Trump administration for blocking detention facility oversight",
  "summary": "Twelve Democratic members of Congress filed suit in federal court after being systematically denied access to ICE detention facilities nationwide. The lawsuit challenges DHS's new policy requiring seven-day advance notice for visits and blocking all access to ICE field offices, which violates federal law guaranteeing congressional oversight. Plaintiffs include Reps. Jason Crow (CO), Jamie Raskin (MD), Veronica Escobar (TX), and others who were physically blocked from facilities in California, Colorado, Texas, Maryland, and New York despite the law permitting unannounced inspections.",
