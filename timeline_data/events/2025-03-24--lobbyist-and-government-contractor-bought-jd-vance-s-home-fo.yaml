title: Government contractor who received $179M in federal contracts buys VP Vance's home for $170K over asking
summary: |
  Christopher Garcia, CEO of Health Supply US which has received $179 million in government
  contracts primarily from Defense and Homeland Security, purchased Vice President JD Vance's
  Alexandria, Virginia home on March 14 for $1.9 million—$172,025 over the $1.69 million
  asking price. Garcia, who served as a Trump Commerce Department appointee from 2017-2018
  and later registered as a lobbyist, bought the property through Nevada LLC 9 EDR just
  five days after it was listed. Vance had purchased the five-bedroom farmhouse for $1.64
  million in February 2023. The above-market purchase by a government contractor with
  extensive federal business raises conflict of interest concerns.
