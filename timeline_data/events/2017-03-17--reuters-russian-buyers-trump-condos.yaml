title: Reuters finds Russians paid $98.4 million for Trump-branded Florida condos
summary: |
  Reuters investigation revealed at least 63 Russian nationals invested $98.4 million in
  Trump-branded properties in South Florida, primarily in Sunny Isles Beach. The buyers
  purchased units at Trump Grande, Trump Towers, and Trump Hollywood, with about one-third
  of all units owned through LLCs that mask true ownership. Most purchases were all-cash
  transactions over $1 million each, and owners didn't declare these assets in Russia,
  fitting patterns associated with money laundering though no illegality was proven.

  Investigation examined seven Trump-branded towers in South Florida. Found 703 of 2,044
  units (one-third) owned by LLCs. Sunny Isles Beach, nicknamed "Little Moscow," has the
  highest concentration of Russian-born residents in the U.S. All buyers investigated were
  legal; none on sanctions lists.
