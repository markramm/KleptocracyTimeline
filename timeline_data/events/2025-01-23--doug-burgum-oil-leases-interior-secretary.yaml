description: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, worth over $100 million from Microsoft
  acquisition, maintains active oil and gas leases with Continental Resources while
  overseeing federal land use policy. As North Dakota governor, designated his own
  real estate holdings as federal opportunity zones, directly benefiting from tax
  breaks he helped create. Now controls drilling permits on federal lands where he
  holds financial interests.

notes: Burgum's appointment places someone with direct fossil fuel financial interests
  in charge of federal drilling permits. His maintenance of Continental Resources
  leases while controlling Interior Department decisions on federal lands represents
  textbook regulatory capture. Previous abuse of opportunity zone designations to
  benefit his own real estate shows pattern of using government power for personal
  enrichment. Controls 500 million acres of federal land and 2.5 billion acres of
  mineral estate while maintaining private drilling interests.
