title: Trump Awards $812M No-Bid COVID Contract to Newly Formed Phlow Corporation
summary: Phlow Corporation, incorporated just months before, received an $812 million
  pharmaceutical manufacturing contract without competitive bidding during the COVID-19
  pandemic. Trump adviser Peter Navarro told officials 'my head is going to explode
  if this contract does not get immediately approved.' The company had no prior pharmaceutical
  manufacturing experience. Separately, Kodak, a photography company emerging from
  bankruptcy, received a $765 million government loan to manufacture pharmaceuticals
  despite lacking relevant experience. Kodak executives made millions from suspicious
  stock trades before the announcement, with the stock price surging 2,190% in two
  days before the SEC investigation halted the deal.
