title: Paul Dans departs as Project 2025 director amid campaign controversy
summary: Paul Dans departed as Project 2025 director on July 30, 2024, amid Trump campaign
  pressure to distance from the Heritage Foundation blueprint. The departure followed
  campaign concerns about the project becoming a political liability, though Russell
  Vought later claimed Trump privately supports the work. Dans also left his position
  at Heritage Foundation around the same time, with later allegations of professional
  misconduct emerging, though the policy phase of Project 2025 was largely complete.

notes: Departure coincided with Trump campaign's public distancing from Project 2025
  despite private support. Dans had been with Heritage Foundation since 2021 and led
  the policy development phase which was nearly complete by July 2024. Later misconduct
  allegations emerged but were separate from the departure reasons.
