title: Bush Creates Faith-Based Initiatives Directing Billions to Religious Groups
summary: President Bush signed Executive Orders establishing the White House Office
  of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, directing billions in federal funding
  to religious organizations while allowing employment discrimination based on religious
  beliefs. By 2006, faith-based organizations received nearly .2 billion in over 3,000
  grants, representing a 21% increase from 2003-2005. The initiatives created centers
  in eleven federal agencies, fundamentally altering church-state separation by allowing
  taxpayer-funded religious discrimination in hiringâ€”the first time since the 1960s
  federal funding permitted employment discrimination based on religion. Veterans
  Affairs grants to faith-based homeless organizations increased 287% (176 to 506
  organizations, 2002-2007) while domestic nutrition assistance grew 9 billion (75%
  increase since 2001). Constitutional challenges led to Hein v. Freedom From Religion
  Foundation (2007), where the Supreme Court ruled taxpayers lacked standing to challenge
  executive branch spending from general appropriations, making it harder to challenge
  discretionary spending under the Establishment Clause. Critics argued the initiatives
  failed the Lemon test by having sectarian purposes, lacking neutrality toward religion,
  and creating excessive government-religion entanglement while raising concerns about
  proselytization and religious coercion in federally funded programs.
