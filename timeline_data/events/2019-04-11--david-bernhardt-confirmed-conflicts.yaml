title: David Bernhardt Confirmed as Interior Secretary Despite 27 Conflicts of Interest
summary: |
  Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as Interior Secretary despite him having the most 
  conflicts of interest of any Trump Cabinet nominee - 27 former clients and employers 
  actively lobbying the Interior Department. A former oil and gas lobbyist, Bernhardt 
  had so many potential conflicts he literally carried a card listing them. His former 
  clients included Halliburton, Cobalt International Energy, and California's Westlands 
  Water District. Within weeks of confirmation, he blocked endangered species protections 
  and opened Arctic lands for drilling that his former clients sought. Environmental 
  groups called him a "walking conflict of interest."

notes: |
  Bernhardt's confirmation represented peak regulatory capture - the Senate knowingly 
  confirmed someone whose conflicts were so numerous he needed a reference card. He 
  immediately began implementing policies benefiting his former clients, including 
  weakening the Endangered Species Act and opening millions of acres for drilling. 
  His tenure demonstrated how the Trump administration transformed government agencies 
  into tools for the industries they were meant to regulate.
