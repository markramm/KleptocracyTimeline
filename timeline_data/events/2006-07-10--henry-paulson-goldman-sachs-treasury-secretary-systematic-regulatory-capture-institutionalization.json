  "title": "Henry Paulson Goldman Sachs CEO Appointment as Treasury Secretary Institutionalizes Systematic Regulatory Capture Through Revolving Door Infrastructure",
  "summary": "President Bush's appointment of Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson as Treasury Secretary institutionalizes systematic regulatory capture through revolving door infrastructure that expands WHIG corporate coordination template into comprehensive Wall Street-government fusion. Paulson's appointment represents systematic evolution from episodic corporate-media coordination to permanent institutional capture where financial industry systematically controls government regulatory policy through direct personnel integration. The Treasury Secretary position provides Goldman Sachs with systematic control over federal financial policy, regulatory implementation, and crisis response mechanisms through established corporate-government coordination infrastructure that bypasses competitive appointment processes and democratic accountability. Paulson's later oversight of $12.9 billion Goldman Sachs bailout through TARP program demonstrates systematic corporate-state fusion where government policy serves corporate profit maximization through coordinated personnel networks that eliminate regulatory independence. This appointment establishes systematic template for regulatory capture: major corporations achieve direct government control through revolving door appointments that systematically corrupt regulatory independence and democratic accountability through permanent corporate-government integration mechanisms.",
