  "title": "Trump Attempts to Unilaterally Fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook",
  "summary": "In an unprecedented move, President Trump attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging mortgage fraud and challenging the independence of the central bank. Cook filed a lawsuit arguing Trump lacks legal authority to remove her, and Federal Judge Jia Cobb granted a temporary restraining order blocking the firing.\n\nKey Details:\n- Trump claimed to be firing Cook based on mortgage fraud allegations from Bill Pulte\n- Cook filed a lawsuit arguing Trump lacks legal authority to remove her\n- Federal Judge Jia Cobb granted a temporary restraining order blocking the firing\n- Judge concluded Trump violated Cook's due process rights and the Federal Reserve Act\n\nBackground: The allegations stem from two home loans Cook obtained in 2021, with Trump citing claims from Bill Pulte about potential primary residence misrepresentation. No criminal charges were filed.\n\nSignificance: This incident highlights the ongoing tension between executive power and institutional independence, with potential long-term implications for democratic governance and central bank autonomy. It represents a direct challenge to the Federal Reserve's independence and potentially sets a dangerous precedent for political interference in monetary policy.",
