  "title": "Supreme Court Navigates Contentious Emergency Powers Dispute",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court issued two critical emergency rulings in May 2025 that revealed deep institutional tensions: granting a stay in Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees to allow large-scale federal workforce reductions, and vacating a district court order blocking summary removals in Trump v. J.G.G. These decisions highlight ongoing legal disputes about presidential authority and executive power, with significant dissent from liberal justices.",
