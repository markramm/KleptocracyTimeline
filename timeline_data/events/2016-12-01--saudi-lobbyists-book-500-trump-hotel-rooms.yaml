title: Saudi Lobbyists Book 500 Rooms at Trump Hotel After Election
summary: |
  Saudi government-paid lobbyists reserved approximately 500 nights at Trump's 
  Washington D.C. hotel within a month of his 2016 election victory, paying around 
  $270,000. The bookings were made by lobbyists representing Saudi Arabia who brought 
  groups of U.S. military veterans to Washington to lobby against a law allowing 
  families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. The payments represent one of the 
  earliest examples of foreign governments directing money to Trump properties 
  following his election.

notes: |
  The Saudi government used lobbyists to funnel money to Trump's business immediately 
  after his election, establishing a pattern of foreign governments paying Trump 
  properties that would continue throughout his presidency. The veterans were often 
  not told who was paying for their trips. This occurred while Trump was president-elect 
  and had not yet divested from his businesses.
