    "title": "Trump Establishes Strategic Crypto Reserve, Expanding U.S. Digital Asset Strategy",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, committing the U.S. government to stockpile Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The reserve will be capitalized through forfeited assets and aims to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. The initiative sparked both market excitement and industry skepticism.",
    "description": "The Strategic Crypto Reserve will hold approximately $17 billion in Bitcoin and $400 million in other digital assets, sourced primarily from government asset forfeitures. The initiative prohibits selling deposited Bitcoin, treating it as a strategic reserve asset analogous to gold.",
