  "date": "1995-12-12",
  "description": "The FDA approves Purdue Pharma's OxyContin with controversial labeling claiming 'delayed absorption, as provided by OxyContin tablets, is believed to reduce the abuse liability of a drug.' This approval was overseen by Dr. Curtis Wright IV, who allowed Purdue to help draft his medical officer's review and met secretly with company representatives in a hotel near FDA offices. The approval was based on theory rather than rigorous clinical studies designed to assess abuse potential, despite Wright knowing this claim was unsubstantiated. This misleading label language would become central to Purdue's aggressive marketing campaign that fueled the opioid epidemic.",
