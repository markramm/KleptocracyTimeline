  "title": "Kansas City Fed Denies Reserve Trust Master Account",
  "summary": "Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City initially denies Reserve Trust Company's application for master account access in June 2017, one month after former Fed Governor Sarah Bloom Raskin joined the fintech's board. The initial denial would later become evidence of potential corruption when the bank reversed its decision in 2018, raising questions about whether Raskin's subsequent communications with Kansas City Fed President Esther George influenced the approval process, demonstrating systematic revolving door corruption where former Fed officials leverage their positions for private sector benefit.",
