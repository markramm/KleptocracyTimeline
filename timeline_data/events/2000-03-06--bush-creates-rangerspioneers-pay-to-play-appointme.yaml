title: Bush Creates Rangers/Pioneers Pay-to-Play Appointment System
summary: 'George W. Bush formalized an unprecedented campaign bundling system where
  ''Rangers'' raising 00,000+ and ''Pioneers'' raising 00,000+ received federal appointments.
  In 2000, 241 Pioneers reached their goals, contributing to Bush raising 7 million
  in first 4 months. By 2004, the program included 221 Rangers, 327 Pioneers, and
  62 ''Super Rangers'' raising 8.5 million combined. The pay-to-play pipeline was
  systematic: 173 Rangers/Pioneers received federal appointments, including 29 ambassadors
  and 4 Cabinet secretaries. Key examples included Mercer Reynolds (Texas Rangers
  co-owner with Bush) becoming Ambassador to Switzerland, Thomas Scully (Medicare
  administrator) designing Part D legislation favoring donors, and Sam Fox (Swift
  Boat funder) becoming Belgium ambassador. Designed by Karl Rove, this represented
  the most extensive formalization of campaign bundling in presidential politics.
  Nearly 1 in 5 elite fundraisers received appointments, creating direct quid pro
  quo between massive donations and government positions. The system institutionalized
  wealthy donors'' access to federal policy-making roles regardless of qualifications.'
