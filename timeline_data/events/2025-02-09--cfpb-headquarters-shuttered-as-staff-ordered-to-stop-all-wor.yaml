title: CFPB Headquarters Shuttered as Staff Ordered to Stop All Work
summary: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees were ordered to "stand down
  from performing any work task" as headquarters was shuttered through February 14.
  Acting Director Russell Vought and chief legal officer Mark Paoletta halted all
  CFPB operations unless specifically cleared, beginning systematic dismantling of
  consumer protection agency.
description: The work stoppage order came as part of broader effort to dismantle CFPB.
  Staff were locked out of headquarters while leadership prepared mass layoffs. This
  was followed by termination of 73 probationary employees on February 11, and RIF
  notices to 1,400+ employees in April, intending to reduce staff from 1,690 to just
  207. DOGE official Gavin Kliger reportedly kept staff up 36 hours straight to ensure
  layoff notices went out, "screaming at people he did not believe were working fast
  enough." Federal judge temporarily blocked the mass layoffs but appeals court later
  allowed them to proceed.
