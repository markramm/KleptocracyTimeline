title: Iran Nuclear Strikes Deliver Strategic Benefits to Saudi Business Partners
summary: Trump's June 2025 military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities delivered
  optimal strategic outcomes for Saudi Arabia while Trump maintained $530 million
  in current Saudi business relationships, creating textbook emoluments violations
  where foreign business interests potentially influenced presidential war powers
  decisions.

notes: This represents the convergence of foreign business interests and presidential
  military action that constitutional scholars identify as the most dangerous form
  of corruption the Framers sought to prevent through emoluments prohibitions. Constitutional
  Crisis Assessment identifies this as "textbook emoluments problem" representing
  "exactly what the Framers feared" - foreign financial relationships potentially
  compromising presidential judgment on matters of war and peace.
