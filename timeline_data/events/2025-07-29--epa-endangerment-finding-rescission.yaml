title: EPA Proposes Rescinding GHG Endangerment Finding and Vehicle Standards
date: 2025-07-29
summary: EPA proposed July 29, 2025, rescinding 2009 Endangerment Finding underpinning
  all U.S. greenhouse gas regulations. Administrator Zeldin called it "largest deregulatory
  action in history," saving $54 billion annually. Proposal claims CAA Section 202(a)
  doesn't authorize climate regulations, questions scientific record. Comment period
  through Sept 22, virtual hearings Aug 19-21.

notes: 'Proposal advances 3 arguments: 1) CAA Section 202(a) doesn''t authorize climate
  standards 2) 2009 Finding unreasonably analyzed science 3) No vehicle tech can meaningfully
  address climate without greater harm. D.C. Circuit upheld finding in 2023, SCOTUS
  refused to hear case. Would eliminate legal basis for all EPA GHG regulations if
  finalized. Major environmental deregulation targeting foundational climate rule.'
