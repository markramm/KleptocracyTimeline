  "summary": "President Trump issued an executive order on February 10, 2025, pausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) enforcement for 180 days. The order halts all DOJ and SEC investigations and prosecutions of U.S. companies for bribing foreign officials, pending new guidelines that will \"prioritize American economic and national security interests.\" This effectively legalizes foreign bribery by U.S. corporations during the pause period.",
