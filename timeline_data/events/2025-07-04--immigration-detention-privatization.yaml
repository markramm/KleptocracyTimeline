title: Budget Bill Allocates $45 Billion for Private Immigration Detention Centers,
  308% Increase
summary: One Big Beautiful Bill provides $45 billion for building new immigration
  detention centers, with overwhelming majority going to private companies contracted
  to build and run facilities. Represents 308% increase over ICE's FY2024 detention
  budget, creating capacity for 125,000 beds operated by private contractors rather
  than federal employees. Part of $170 billion immigration enforcement funding channeled
  through reconciliation to avoid congressional oversight.

notes: Funding structured to flow primarily through private contractors rather than
  expanding federal capacity, ensuring public funds generate private profits while
  reducing public control over detention operations.
