title: 'Alligator Alcatraz tent detention camp in Everglades evacuated by federal court'
summary: A $450 million tent detention facility dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" operated in the Everglades with detainees facing extreme heat exceeding 110Â°F, severe bug infestations, and denial of basic sanitation. Federal courts ordered emergency evacuation after finding conditions constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Despite violations, contractors received full payment with CoreCivic's CEO declaring "Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand."
