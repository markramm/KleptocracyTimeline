  "title": "BBC China Seized with Nuclear Components from A.Q. Khan Dubai Hub",
  "summary": "Italian authorities seized the German-flagged cargo vessel BBC China at the port of Taranto carrying nuclear centrifuge components bound for Libya's weapons program. The ship had picked up its cargo in Dubai, which served as the primary transshipment hub for A.Q. Khan's nuclear smuggling network. Five shipping containers were removed under conditions of great secrecy, containing gas centrifuge parts manufactured in Malaysia by the Scomi Group and shipped through Khan's Dubai-based operations managed by his Sri Lankan associate Buhary Syed Abu Tahir. This seizure exposed how Dubai's port infrastructure was systematically exploited by the world's most dangerous nuclear proliferation network to ship weapons-grade materials to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The incident directly contradicted later claims by Dubai Ports World and UAE officials about port security, as Dubai had served as the nerve center for nuclear smuggling operations for over a decade without detection by UAE authorities.",
