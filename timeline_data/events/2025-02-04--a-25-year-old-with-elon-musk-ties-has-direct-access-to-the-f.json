    "summary": "A 25-year-old engineer, Marko Elez, with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX and X, was granted administrator-level access to the US Treasury Department's critical $5 trillion payment systems, raising significant concerns about institutional security and potential regulatory capture.",
    "description": "Marko Elez, a 25-year-old software engineer with previous experience at SpaceX and X (Twitter), was granted administrator-level access to critical US Treasury payment systems through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His access included the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which manages over $5 trillion in annual federal payments.\n\nKey details:\n- Received access on February 3-5, 2025\n- Laptop configured with read/write permissions to payment system databases\n- Resigned on February 6, 2025, after access misconfiguration was discovered\n- Potential ability to modify or interrupt federal payment systems\n\nThe incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in government technology infrastructure and raises questions about the Trump Administration's approach to hiring and system access.",
