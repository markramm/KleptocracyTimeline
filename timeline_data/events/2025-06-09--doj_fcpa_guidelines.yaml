title: DOJ issues updated guidelines for FCPA investigations and enforcement
summary: The Justice Department released updated Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
  guidelines on June 9, 2025, signaling the end of the blanket enforcement pause instituted
  in February. The new guidelines prioritize U.S. business interests and significantly
  narrow enforcement focus, effectively decriminalizing many forms of foreign bribery
  previously prosecuted.
