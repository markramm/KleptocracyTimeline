  "title": "Corporate Registered Lobbyists Increase 1,400% as Powell Memo Strategy Succeeds",
  "summary": "By 1982, the number of corporate registered lobbyists in Washington DC had exploded from just 175 in 1971 (when the Powell Memo was written) to nearly 2,500, representing a staggering 1,400% increase over eleven years. This dramatic expansion directly implemented Lewis Powell's strategic memorandum calling for coordinated corporate political mobilization to counter perceived attacks on the free enterprise system. The growth was systematically orchestrated through organizations like the Business Roundtable (1972), Heritage Foundation (1973), and ALEC (1973), which provided infrastructure for corporate coordination and lobbying strategy. The increase coincided with major corporate political victories including defeating antitrust legislation (1975), blocking labor law reform (1977-1978), and establishing corporate First Amendment rights (Bellotti v. First National Bank, 1978). This lobbyist explosion fundamentally altered the balance of political influence in Washington, creating what scholars recognize as the foundation of modern corporate capture of democratic institutions and regulatory agencies.",
