title: DHS ends sensitive locations policy allowing ICE arrests at churches and schools
summary: The Department of Homeland Security ended a long-standing policy that restricted
  ICE agents' ability to arrest undocumented people at sensitive locations including
  houses of worship, schools, and hospitals. DHS stated "Criminals will no longer
  be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest," marking a significant
  escalation in enforcement tactics that breaks with decades of precedent.
