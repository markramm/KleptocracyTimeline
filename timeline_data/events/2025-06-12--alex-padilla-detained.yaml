summary: Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) was forcibly removed from DHS Secretary Kristi
  Noem's press conference at Los Angeles FBI headquarters on June 12, 2025. After
  interjecting with a question six minutes into Noem's remarks about immigration protests,
  uniformed FBI police forced him to his knees, handcuffed him while on the ground,
  and detained him. DHS falsely claimed he didn't identify himself, though video shows
  he did. He was released after being identified as a senator.

notes: First Latino senator to represent California was detained despite identifying
  himself. Gov. Newsom called it "outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful." Noem falsely
  claimed on Fox News that Padilla "burst into the room" and "started lunging towards
  the podium," contradicted by video evidence. This occurred during military deployment
  to LA for immigration protests.
