title: Supreme Court Blocks Biden OSHA Vaccine Mandate as Executive Overreach
summary: The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to block President Biden's OSHA mandate requiring
  businesses with 100+ employees to enforce COVID vaccination or weekly testing, affecting
  84 million workers. The Court held that while OSHA can regulate 'occupational dangers,'
  it lacks authority to 'regulate public health more broadly.' The majority wrote
  that requiring vaccination of 84 million Americans 'selected simply because they
  work for employers with more than 100 employees' exceeded OSHA's statutory authority.
  The Biden administration withdrew the mandate on January 26. The Court simultaneously
  upheld a narrower CMS mandate for healthcare workers receiving federal funds. This
  marked a significant limit on executive agency power to address emergencies without
  clear Congressional authorization.
