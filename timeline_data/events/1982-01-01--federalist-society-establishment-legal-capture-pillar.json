  "date": "1982-01-01",
  "description": "The Federalist Society is established to systematically cultivate conservative lawyers from law school through their entire careers, implementing Pillar Two of the Powell Memorandum strategy. Operating alongside corporate-funded legal foundations like Pacific Legal Foundation (1973) and Mountain States Legal Foundation (1977), the Federalist Society creates a comprehensive legal capture apparatus. By 2020, this patient strategy achieves complete success with six of nine Supreme Court justices as Federalist Society members, lower courts packed with corporate-friendly judges, and legal doctrines limiting corporate liability established as constitutional orthodoxy.",

  "historical_significance": "The Federalist Society's establishment completed the systematic legal capture strategy outlined in the Powell Memorandum. Through patient, comprehensive cultivation of conservative legal professionals, it achieved near-complete transformation of the American legal system, establishing corporate-friendly legal doctrines as constitutional orthodoxy and demonstrating the effectiveness of long-term institutional capture strategies."
