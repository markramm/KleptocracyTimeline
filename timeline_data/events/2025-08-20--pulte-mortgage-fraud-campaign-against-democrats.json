  "summary": "William Pulte uses FHFA access to mortgage databases to accuse Senator Adam Schiff and NY AG Letitia James of mortgage fraud, establishing pattern of weaponizing financial surveillance against Trump opponents.",
  "description": "Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte expands his mortgage fraud campaign beyond Fed Governor Lisa Cook to include Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Using FHFA's access to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage data covering most US home loans, Pulte searches political opponents' mortgage applications for technical violations around primary residence declarations. All three targets are prominent Trump critics - James prosecuted Trump for fraud, Schiff led impeachment efforts, Cook opposed Trump's Fed policies. Critics call this \"incredibly dangerous abuse of office\" using GSE control for political enemies list.",

  "notes": "Pulte's systematic campaign represents unprecedented abuse of government mortgage databases for political targeting. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which process majority of US mortgages, giving Pulte access to private financial data of millions. His focus on primary residence technicalities in mortgage applications creates pretext for criminal referrals. Rep. Maxine Waters calls this \"alarming actions\" raising \"serious concerns about conflicts of interest, legal violations.\" Pattern resembles Nixon's enemies list but with modern financial surveillance capabilities."
