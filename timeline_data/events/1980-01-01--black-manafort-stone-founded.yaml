notes: 'The firm represented numerous brutal dictators including Ferdinand Marcos (Philippines),
  Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire), Jonas Savimbi (Angola), and Sani Abacha (Nigeria). By
  1991-1992, their work with dictators brought in $3.3 million. In 1984, Peter Kelly
  joined as a named partner, creating the first bipartisan lobbying shop. The firm
  was acquired by Burson-Marsteller in 1991 and later merged to form BKSH & Associates
  in 1996. Trump was their first client, establishing a long relationship between
  these political operatives and Trump.'
