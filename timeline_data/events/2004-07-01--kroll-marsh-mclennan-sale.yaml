title: Kroll Associates sold to Marsh & McLennan for $1.9 billion
summary: Marsh & McLennan acquired Kroll Inc. for $1.9 billion in July 2004, absorbing
  the 'private CIA' into a major insurance conglomerate. The acquisition represented
  the full corporatization of intelligence capabilities, with Kroll's 3,000 employees
  in 65 offices worldwide conducting investigations and risk assessments for corporations
  and governments. The deal highlighted how privatized intelligence had become a multi-billion
  dollar industry operating with minimal oversight.

notes: The $1.9 billion sale price reflects the massive commercial value of intelligence
  capabilities that had been pushed into private hands by post-Watergate reforms,
  creating a shadow intelligence industry serving the highest bidders. Sale demonstrates
  how post-Watergate intelligence privatization created lucrative industry where former
  government capabilities were monetized through private firms serving corporate clients
  and foreign governments without equivalent oversight.
