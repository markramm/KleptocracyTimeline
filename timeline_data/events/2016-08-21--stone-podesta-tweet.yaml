title: Stone tweets "Podesta's time in the barrel" 47 days before WikiLeaks
summary: Roger Stone tweeted "Trust me, it will soon be the Podesta's time in the
  barrel" on August 21, 2016 - 47 days before WikiLeaks released Podesta emails on
  October 7. Even Podesta himself didn't know about the hack until WikiLeaks began
  leaking. Stone claimed he meant Podesta's business dealings, not emails, despite
  telling Florida GOP group on August 10 he had "communicated with Julian Assange."

notes: Direct evidence of campaign coordination with Russian intelligence operations.
  Rep. Adam Schiff asked - "Is it a coincidence that Roger Stone predicted that John
  Podesta would be a victim of a Russian hack and have his private emails published,
  and did so even before Mr. Podesta himself was fully aware that his private emails
  would be exposed?"
