title: Trump Claims Absolute Immunity from Congressional Oversight
summary: The Trump administration claimed 'absolute immunity' to block all congressional
  oversight, with White House Counsel Pat Cipollone declaring Congress had no 'legitimate
  legislative purpose' for investigations. Don McGahn defied House subpoenas despite
  federal judges ruling presidents 'are not kings.' John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Mick
  Mulvaney, and dozens of officials refused to testify about Ukraine, Russia, and other
  scandals. The administration blocked all document requests, instructing the entire
  executive branch not to cooperate with impeachment proceedings. Trump sued his own
  accounting firm and banks to prevent them from complying with congressional subpoenas.
  Federal courts repeatedly ruled against these claims, with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson
  writing that 'absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony simply does
  not exist.' This unprecedented stonewalling prevented Congress from fulfilling its
  constitutional oversight role, establishing a dangerous precedent that the executive
  branch could simply ignore legislative branch authority.
