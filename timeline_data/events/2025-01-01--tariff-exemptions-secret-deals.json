  "summary": "In Trump's second term after 2024, favoritism in tariff policy became more blatant. Instead of a public application process for exemptions, deals are now struck in secret with industry executives and lobbyists making their case privately. The administration issued a list of over 1,000 exempted products with minimal explanation. Wall Street Journal warned this opaque system invites even greater cronyism.",
