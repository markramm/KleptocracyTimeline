  "title": "Tax Day Tea Party Protests Organized by Koch Network Groups",
  "summary": "The first coordinated nationwide Tax Day Tea Party protests take place across the United States, organized primarily by Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks - both organizations rooted in the Koch brothers' former Citizens for a Sound Economy. These protests, presented as grassroots citizen uprisings against government spending and taxation, are actually orchestrated by well-funded corporate advocacy groups with deep ties to billionaire industrialists. The protests demonstrate the effectiveness of the astroturfing infrastructure developed over decades, successfully creating the appearance of organic citizen outrage while advancing corporate political interests. FreedomWorks had been planning major protests since March 2009, following Rick Santelli's February rant, with Brendan Steinhauser directing the organizational efforts. The events mark the public launch of the Tea Party as a seemingly grassroots political force, though academic research later confirms its astroturfed origins.",
