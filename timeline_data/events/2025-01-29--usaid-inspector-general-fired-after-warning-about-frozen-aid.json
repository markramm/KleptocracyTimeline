  "title": "USAID Inspector General Fired After Warning About Frozen Aid Creating Half-Billion Dollar Loss",
  "summary": "USAID Inspector General Paul Martin was fired two weeks after issuing report warning that emergency aid freeze ordered by administration meant half a billion dollars in food aid might spoil or be stolen. Martin's firing came as part of broader pattern targeting watchdogs who issued unfavorable reports about administration policies.",
  "description": "Paul Martin issued a report documenting how the administration's freeze on foreign aid programs had stopped emergency assistance from moving, creating conditions where $500 million in food aid was at risk of spoilage or theft. Two weeks after the report, Martin was terminated along with other inspectors general. The firing demonstrated the administration's retaliation against oversight officials who documented negative consequences of policy decisions, particularly those affecting humanitarian programs.",
