  "title": "South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol Declares Martial Law, Triggering Democratic Crisis",
  "summary": "On December 3, 2024, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law at 11 PM, a shocking move that lasted only six hours before being unanimously rejected by the National Assembly. Claiming to protect against 'anti-state forces', Yoon's decree was widely seen as an attempt to circumvent the opposition-controlled legislature. The incident led to his Defense Minister's resignation, nationwide protests, and an impeachment process that ultimately removed him from office on April 4, 2025. This event marked a critical test of South Korea's democratic institutions, which ultimately proved resilient by swiftly countering the authoritarian impulse.",
