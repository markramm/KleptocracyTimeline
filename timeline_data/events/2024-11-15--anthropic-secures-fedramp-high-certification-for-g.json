  "title": "Anthropic Secures FedRAMP High Certification for Government AI Deployment",
  "summary": "Anthropic achieved FedRAMP High certification for Claude, the most stringent security requirement for handling unclassified sensitive government data, followed by Palantir announcing a partnership to provide U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to Claude 3 and 3.5 in classified environments.\n\nThis represents the first deployment of Claude models in classified government settings, demonstrating how AI safety rhetoric serves as a pathway to critical national security infrastructure contracts. Anthropic leveraged their Constitutional AI framework and safety positioning to gain unprecedented access to government decision-making systems.\n\nThe partnership with Palantir, a company with extensive intelligence community ties, positions Anthropic's AI systems at the center of national security operations. This integration of private AI systems into classified government functions raises significant concerns about corporate influence over state surveillance and intelligence activities.\n\nAnthropic's approach differs from competitors by emphasizing constitutional AI principles and safety frameworks, which proved effective in gaining government trust and security clearances. The company's partnerships with external domain experts in terrorism, radicalization, and national security further embedded them within government policy networks.",
