  "summary": "Melania Trump launched her $MELANIA cryptocurrency two days after Donald Trump's coin, with highly suspicious trading patterns. Just 24 wallets rapidly purchased massive amounts of Melania tokens immediately after launch, netting a combined $99.6 million windfall within hours. The coordinated buying pattern suggested insider trading or manipulation, as these wallets appeared to have advance knowledge of the coin's launch and timing.",
