  "title": "Federal Reserve Approves Section 20 Subsidiaries for JP Morgan, Citicorp, and Bankers Trust",
  "summary": "The Federal Reserve Board approves bank holding companies JP Morgan & Co., Citicorp, and Bankers Trust to establish Section 20 subsidiaries for underwriting mortgage-backed securities, municipal revenue bonds, and commercial paper. This regulatory decision represents the first major breach in Glass-Steagall's separation of commercial and investment banking, allowing banks to earn up to 5% of revenue from previously prohibited securities activities. The approval establishes 'firewalls' between commercial banks and their securities affiliates but creates the regulatory framework for systematic Glass-Steagall erosion.",
