title: Ex-DOGE worker Coristine attacked, Trump threatens federal DC takeover
summary: |
  Edward "Big Balls" Coristine, 19, was assaulted during attempted carjacking by 10 teenagers
  in Logan Circle at 3 AM. Trump immediately used the incident to threaten federal takeover
  of DC, stating "If D.C. doesn't get its act together, we will have no choice but to take
  Federal control." This occurred despite violent crime being down 26% and at 30-year lows.
  The incident became pretext for deploying 1,450+ National Guard troops to DC, placing
  local police under federal control.

notes: |
  Two 15-year-old suspects from Maryland arrested. Coristine had resigned from government
  in June 2025. Trump's response came within hours of incident. Federal takeover threats
  escalated to actual deployment of Guard troops by August 11. Crime statistics showed DC
  actually safer than in decades, contradicting Trump's "totally out of control" narrative.
