title: Trump Model Management Lawsuit Dismissed on Technicality Despite Evidence
summary: Federal judge dismisses Alexia Palmer's class-action lawsuit against Trump
  Model Management on procedural grounds, ruling she failed to exhaust administrative
  remedies before filing suit. The dismissal avoided ruling on the merits of extensive
  evidence showing models were paid less than $4,000 while H-1B applications promised
  $75,000 salaries, housed in overcrowded conditions, and subjected to illegal working
  conditions. The case was dismissed just as Trump's presidential campaign gained
  momentum.
