title: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) created; Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy
  tapped to lead
summary: Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, creating the Department of Government
  Efficiency (DOGE) by renaming the U.S. Digital Service to "U.S. DOGE Service" for 18 months.
  Elon Musk leads the temporary organization set to expire July 4, 2026, with a mandate to upgrade
  federal IT systems to "private-sector standards" and cut $500 billion in annual federal costs.
  Vivek Ramaswamy departed the same day to run for Ohio governor. The order formalized what was
  announced in November 2024, placing DOGE within the Executive Office of the President despite
  earlier claims it would operate "outside of Government."
