  "date": "2002-08-20",
  "description": "Television network executives at CNN, NBC, CBS, and other major networks make systematic corporate policy decisions to prioritize government access and cooperation over journalistic independence and skeptical reporting. These executives implement booking policies that favor government officials, establish editorial guidelines that discourage challenging government narratives, and create institutional incentives for reporters and producers to maintain positive relationships with administration officials. This corporate decision-making transforms supposedly independent news organizations into compliant government messaging platforms, abandoning journalistic principles for access privileges.",
