title: Fisher Sand & Gravel Wins $2B Border Wall Contracts After Fox News Lobbying
summary: Fisher Sand & Gravel received over $2 billion in border wall contracts after
  CEO Tommy Fisher appeared on Fox News over 20 times lobbying Trump directly, despite
  the company's history of tax fraud and environmental violations. Senator Kevin Cramer
  personally lobbied Trump for Fisher at a White House meeting. The Pentagon Inspector
  General investigated potential improper White House influence after Trump repeatedly
  mentioned Fisher by name, ordering the Army Corps to award them contracts. Fisher's
  first $400 million contract came despite finishing last in the competitive bidding
  process. The company paid $40 million in tax fraud penalties in 2009 and faced multiple
  environmental violations. A section of Fisher's wall in Texas began showing signs
  of erosion within months. The contracts demonstrated how Fox News appearances and
  political connections trumped qualifications in government contracting. Fisher also
  built a private border wall that violated international treaties.
