    "summary": "Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev purchased Trump's Palm Beach mansion, 'Maison de L'Amitié', for $95 million—more than double Trump's 2004 purchase price of $41.35 million. The transaction, occurring during the 2008 financial crisis, drew significant scrutiny from Senator Ron Wyden and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team for potential money laundering or illicit financial dealings. Rybolovlev later demolished the property and subdivided the land, selling individual lots for a combined $108.2 million.",
