title: Kushner Receives $1.28B Qatar Bailout After Blockade Reversal
summary: Jared Kushner's underwater 666 Fifth Avenue property received a $1.28 billion
  bailout from Brookfield Property Partners, where Qatar Investment Authority held
  a 7-9% stake, just months after Trump reversed U.S. support for the Saudi-led Qatar
  blockade. The Kushners had desperately sought Qatari financing since 2015, with
  Charles Kushner personally flying to Doha in April 2017 seeking investment. After
  Qatar refused, Kushner supported the Saudi blockade in June 2017. When the blockade
  threatened U.S. military interests at Al Udeid Air Base, Trump reversed course.
  Brookfield then paid the Kushners' entire $1.28 billion mortgage in a 99-year lease
  deal that real estate experts called uncommercial. The timeline suggested U.S. Middle
  East policy was influenced by Kushner's personal financial crisis. Kushner simultaneously
  maintained backchannel communications with Saudi Crown Prince MBS via WhatsApp.
