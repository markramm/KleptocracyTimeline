title: Jeffrey Clark's Attempted DOJ Takeover to Overturn Georgia Election Results
  Fails
summary: In dramatic Oval Office confrontation, Trump attempted to install Jeffrey
  Clark as Acting Attorney General to use DOJ to overturn Georgia's election results.
  White House call logs already listed Clark as "Acting Attorney General" that afternoon.
  Scheme collapsed when Acting AG Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy AG Richard Donoghue, and OLC
  head Steven Engel threatened mass resignations, joined by all Assistant Attorneys
  General. Trump backed down when faced with complete DOJ leadership exodus.

notes: Clark had drafted letter to Georgia officials falsely claiming DOJ found significant
  election fraud. Only mass resignation threats from entire DOJ leadership prevented
  weaponization of department for election overthrow.
