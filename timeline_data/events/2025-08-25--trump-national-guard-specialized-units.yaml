notes: This represents a significant expansion of military involvement in domestic
  law enforcement, traditionally restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. The creation
  of "specialized units" specifically for public order issues suggests preparation
  for widespread civil unrest suppression. The combination with federal control of
  DC police creates a centralized force answerable directly to the executive branch,
  bypassing local civilian control. The "quick reaction force" language echoes military
  counterinsurgency doctrine being applied domestically.
