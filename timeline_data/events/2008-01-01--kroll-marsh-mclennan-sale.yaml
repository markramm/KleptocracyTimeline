notes: The $1.9 billion sale price reflects the massive commercial value of intelligence
  capabilities that had been pushed into private hands by post-Watergate reforms,
  creating a shadow intelligence industry serving the highest bidders. Sale demonstrates
  how post-Watergate intelligence privatization created lucrative industry where former
  government capabilities were monetized through private firms serving corporate clients
  and foreign governments without equivalent oversight.
