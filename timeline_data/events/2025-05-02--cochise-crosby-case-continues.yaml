summary: Cochise County Supervisor Thomas Crosby's trial for conspiring to delay the 2022 election certification was pushed back from May to September 2025. Crosby faces felony charges for refusing to certify the county's votes by the legal deadline, risking 47,000 voters' ballots. He has incurred $263,000 in legal fees and seeks $300,000 from the county's insurer. Co-supervisor Peggy Judd pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. An appeals court ruled Crosby wasn't protected by legislative immunity.

notes: Crosby was the only Arizona county supervisor to miss the Nov 28, 2022 certification deadline. He claimed voting machines weren't properly accredited. This case sets precedent for whether local officials can refuse to certify election results they disagree with.
