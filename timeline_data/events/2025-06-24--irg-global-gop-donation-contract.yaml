title: Emergency contractor donates $10,000 to Florida GOP, receives $6.2 million in contracts hours later
summary: IRG Global Emergency Management donated $10,000 to the Florida GOP on June 24, 2025, and received a $1.1 million Alligator Alcatraz contract hours later. Within a week, the company secured two additional contracts totaling $5.1 million for shuttle transportation, emergency services, and air operations. IRG, formed in February 2025, is an offshoot of Access Restoration Services (ARS), which previously donated $250,000 to DeSantis PACs and holds $108 million in state contracts. The contracts bypassed competitive bidding using emergency powers, with IRG ultimately receiving $20.8 million total despite being a new company.

notes: IRG executives linked to companies sued for inflating hurricane insurance claims. Employees alleged they were used as "pawns in a plan to file inflated insurance claims in federally-declared disaster areas." Emergency declarations allow bypassing procurement rules and competitive bidding.
