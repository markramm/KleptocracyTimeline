    "summary": "Chief of Staff Andrew Card forms White House Iraq Group (WHIG), chaired by Karl Rove, to coordinate systematic messaging strategy for Iraq War. Group includes key Powell Memo-aligned figures including communications strategists Karen Hughes, Mary Matalin, and policy coordination through Condoleezza Rice and Scooter Libby. WHIG represents first large-scale implementation of Powell Memo crisis-exploitation template for rapid institutional capture acceleration, strategically crafting a public relations narrative to build support for the Iraq invasion by leveraging post-9/11 security fears.",
