Her 2017 Assad trip, financed by groups with Syrian regime ties, violated congressional notification requirements. She regularly appears on Russian state media, blamed NATO for Ukraine invasion, and called Zelensky a \"dictator.\" Intelligence allies now questioning whether to share sensitive information with U.S., potentially blind America to threats. Her minimal intelligence experience compounds concerns about protecting sources and methods.",
