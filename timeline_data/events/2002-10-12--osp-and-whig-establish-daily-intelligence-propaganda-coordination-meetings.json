    "summary": "The Office of Special Plans (OSP), led by Douglas Feith, and the White House Iraq Group (WHIG) institutionalized daily coordination meetings to synchronize intelligence production with propaganda messaging. These meetings enabled the systematic manipulation of intelligence to support the Bush administration's case for invading Iraq, bypassing traditional intelligence assessment processes.",
    "description": "Office of Special Plans and White House Iraq Group establish daily meetings to ensure intelligence products from the Pentagon directly support public messaging campaigns about Iraq. This coordination mechanism allowed for the selective use of intelligence data to build a case for war, effectively transforming intelligence gathering into a propaganda operation.",
