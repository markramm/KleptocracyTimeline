title: ICE operates 1,000+ undisclosed detention sites in shadow network
summary: Between 2017-2021, ICE expanded its detention network through 40 new contracts and
  agreements with minimal documentation or oversight. GAO found 28 of 40 facilities lacked proper
  documentation showing need or local outreach. ICE used intergovernmental service agreements
  to bypass procurement laws, paying $20.5 million monthly for 12,000+ unused beds by May 2020.
  The network included family residential centers, hotels for transport, and facilities operated
  900 miles from their contracting cities. Officers reported management hindered independent
  oversight of detention contracts.
