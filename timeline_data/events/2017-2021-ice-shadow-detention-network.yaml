title: ICE relies on a sprawling, mostly contracted network of ~200 detention facilities; oversight fragmented
summary: GAO reports document ICE's reliance on a complex network of contracted
  detention facilities, including Intergovernmental Service Agreements (IGSAs) with
  guaranteed-minimum payment structures. In FY2019, ICE maintained contracts with
  230+ facilities for longer‑term detention, alongside short‑term holds in jails
  and Border Patrol stations. GAO identified significant oversight gaps, with multiple
  DHS entities conducting inspections but lacking clearly defined performance goals
  and measures.
