title: ICE relies on a sprawling, mostly contracted network of ~200 detention facilities; oversight fragmented
summary: GAO reports and ICE records show that, in FY2019, ICE had contracts/agreements
  with 230+ facilities for longer‑term detention, alongside many short‑term holds in
  jails and Border Patrol stations. TRAC data indicate ~181 authorized detention facilities
  in 2025. Multiple DHS entities inspect facilities, but performance goals and measures
  remain under‑defined.
