title: Whistleblower reports DOGE exposed 300 million Americans' Social Security data
summary: |
  SSA Chief Data Officer Charles Borges filed a whistleblower complaint alleging DOGE
  employees, including 19-year-old Ed "Big Balls" Coristine, created an unsecured copy
  of the NUMIDENT database containing Social Security numbers, names, birthdates, and
  citizenship data for 300+ million Americans on a vulnerable cloud server. SSA cybersecurity
  officials called it "very high risk" and discussed possibly reissuing Social Security
  numbers to all Americans if breached.

  The NUMIDENT database includes all information from Social Security card applications.
  On June 10, 2025, former DOGE employee John Solly requested the database copy to a
  private cloud. Borges warned of potential widespread identity theft and loss of health
  care and food benefits if breached. SSA claimed data remains secure.
