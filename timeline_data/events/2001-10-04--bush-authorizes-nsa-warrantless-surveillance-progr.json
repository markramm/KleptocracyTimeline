  "title": "Bush Authorizes NSA Warrantless Surveillance Program",
  "summary": "President George W. Bush signed a secret executive order authorizing the National Security Agency to conduct warrantless surveillance of American citizens' phone calls and emails, bypassing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court established by Congress. The program, codenamed 'Stellar Wind,' allowed the NSA to monitor communications without probable cause or judicial oversight, directly violating the Fourth Amendment and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. NSA Director Michael Hayden later testified that the program monitored 'thousands' of Americans. The authorization came just weeks after 9/11, exploiting national trauma to expand executive power beyond constitutional limits. When revealed in 2005, the program triggered a constitutional crisis over separation of powers and civil liberties.",
