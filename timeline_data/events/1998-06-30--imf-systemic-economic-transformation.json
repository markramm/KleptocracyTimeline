  "title": "IMF Finalizes Systematic Economic Transformation of Southeast Asian Economies",
  "summary": "By mid-1998, the IMF completes its comprehensive restructuring of Southeast Asian economies through massive bailout packages totaling nearly $100 billion, implementing radical free-market reforms that fundamentally reshape the region's economic landscape. These interventions prioritized Western corporate interests, dismantled local economic protections, and created long-term dependency on international financial institutions through conditional structural adjustment programs.",
