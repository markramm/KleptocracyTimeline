    "importance": 8,
    "summary": "Internal agency data reveals a dramatic decline in FDA enforcement actions against pharmaceutical companies. Annual warning letters dropped from over 130 in the late 1990s to just three in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in regulatory oversight. Investigations by ProPublica and HHS show systemic challenges including minimal foreign factory inspections (only 6% in 2022) and repeated exemptions for banned manufacturing facilities.",
