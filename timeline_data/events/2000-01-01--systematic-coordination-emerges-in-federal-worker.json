    "title": "Project 2025: Systematic Dismantling of Federal Civil Service Infrastructure",
    "summary": "The Trump administration, through Project 2025 and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), launches a comprehensive strategy to fundamentally transform the federal workforce by implementing Schedule F (renamed 'Schedule Policy/Career'), which strips civil service protections from policy-related roles. This coordinated effort aims to replace merit-based civil servants with politically loyal appointees, potentially eliminating up to 1 million federal jobs through agency dismantling, hiring freezes, and targeted reductions.",
