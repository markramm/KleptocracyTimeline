summary: All Voting Is Local released an analysis on April 2, 2025, showing that 34,000
  Ohio ballots were rejected in the 2024 election following implementation of House Bill 458's
  stricter voter ID requirements and process changes. This represents a significant increase
  in ballot rejections compared to previous elections, disproportionately affecting elderly,
  disabled, and minority voters who faced new documentation hurdles.

  ballot deficiencies. The 34,000 rejected ballots could have changed outcomes in close
  local races. Pattern consistent with nationwide voter suppression efforts.
