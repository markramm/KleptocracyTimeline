title: Supreme Court Upholds Voting Rights Act in Allen v. Milligan Alabama Redistricting
  Case
summary: U.S. Supreme Court delivered historic victory for voting rights in Allen
  v. Milligan with 5-4 decision affirming Alabama's congressional map violated Section
  2 of Voting Rights Act by diluting Black voting power. Court ordered Alabama to
  create second majority-Black congressional district. When Alabama legislature defied
  order in July 2023, federal court appointed special master who drew remedial maps.
  In May 2025, Northern District of Alabama issued permanent injunction finding state
  acted with discriminatory intent, marking rare finding of intentional racial discrimination
  in modern redistricting.
