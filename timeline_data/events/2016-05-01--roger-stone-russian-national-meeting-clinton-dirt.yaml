notes: This meeting, occurring in May 2016 before most public awareness of Russian
  interference, demonstrates how Russian operatives systematically approached Trump
  associates with offers of compromising information on Clinton. "Henry Greenberg"
  (also known as Henry Oknyansky) claimed to be an FBI informant, adding layers of
  complexity to the interaction. Stone and Caputo's failure to initially disclose
  this meeting to congressional investigators suggests consciousness of its problematic
  nature. While Stone claims he rejected the offer due to the price, the meeting itself
  shows willingness to engage with foreign nationals offering stolen information.
