  "title": "DOJ Settles Microsoft Antitrust Case with Weak Remedy After Political Pressure",
  "summary": "The Department of Justice reached a settlement with Microsoft that effectively abandoned meaningful antitrust enforcement, despite a federal judge finding Microsoft guilty of monopolistic practices. The Bush administration's DOJ retreated from the Clinton administration's plan to break up Microsoft, instead accepting a settlement that required only minor behavioral changes and monitoring. This marked a critical turning point in antitrust enforcement, establishing the precedent that tech monopolies could avoid structural remedies through political influence and regulatory capture. The weak settlement allowed Microsoft to maintain its monopoly position and demonstrated that corporate political influence could effectively neutralize antitrust enforcement, setting the stage for future Big Tech monopolization.",
