notes: 'FBI agents typically work at desks, lack training for community policing. Trump admin
  didn''t consult DC police leadership on optimal deployment. Trump compared DC crime action
  to border crackdown. Week-long minimum deployment. Secret Service Uniformed Division also
  launched special patrols. Unprecedented use of FBI for street-level law enforcement.'
