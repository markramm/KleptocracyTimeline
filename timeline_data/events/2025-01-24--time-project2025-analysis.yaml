title: Time finds early executive actions mirror Project 2025
summary: Four days into the new term, Time magazine analysis reports nearly two-thirds
  of Trump's executive actions align with Project 2025 proposals, despite Trump's
  campaign claims he wanted "nothing to do with Project 2025." Includes alignment
  on immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation, and Schedule F federal
  employee reclassification.
