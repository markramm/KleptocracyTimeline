title: DOJ and FBI gut public corruption enforcement teams
summary: Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel gave a "green light
  to would-be lawbreakers" by gutting the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section
  and folding one of the FBI's public corruption squads. Democrats warned that DOJ's
  refusal to enforce anti-corruption laws betrays the public trust and will create
  lasting harm to Americans' faith in the integrity of government officials.
