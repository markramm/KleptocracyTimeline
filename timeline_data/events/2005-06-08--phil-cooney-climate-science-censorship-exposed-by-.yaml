title: Phil Cooney Climate Science Censorship Exposed by Whistleblower
summary: White House Council on Environmental Quality Chief of Staff Phil Cooney was
  exposed systematically censoring climate science reports to exaggerate uncertainties
  and diminish human influence on climate change. Whistleblower Rick Piltz revealed
  Cooney made 294 edits to the 364-page Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change
  Science Program, with at least 181 edits aimed at exaggerating scientific uncertainties
  and 113 edits to diminish human influence. A former American Petroleum Institute
  lawyer and lobbyist, Cooney deleted entire paragraphs about projected mountain glacier
  reductions and added qualifier words like 'extremely,' 'significant,' and 'fundamental'
  before 'uncertainties in climate science.' House oversight found a 'systematic effort
  to manipulate climate change science' affecting NASA's James Hansen, who was placed
  under 'administrative house arrest' and denied media interviews. NOAA's Thomas Knutson
  had media appearances blocked, while NASA's Drew Shindell saw press releases 'repeatedly
  delayed, altered and watered down.' Cooney resigned June 10, 2005, immediately after
  the scandal broke and was hired by ExxonMobil days later, epitomizing the revolving
  door between oil industry and government climate policy.
