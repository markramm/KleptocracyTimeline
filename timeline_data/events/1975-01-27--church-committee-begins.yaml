title: Church Committee begins exposing illegal intelligence activities
summary: The U.S. Senate voted 82-to-4 on January 27, 1975 to form the Select Committee
  to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, chaired by
  Senator Frank Church of Idaho. Created after Seymour Hersh's December 1974 NYT revelations
  about CIA assassination attempts, the committee exposed decades of illegal activities
  including NSA's Project Shamrock (copying telegrams since 1947), Project Minaret (monitoring
  MLK, Muhammad Ali, even Church himself), Operation MKULTRA (drugging/torturing citizens),
  and HTLINGUAL (opening 215,000+ pieces of mail). The committee's April 1976 six-book
  report triggered reforms including FISA (1978) and permanent oversight, inadvertently
  creating opportunities for private intelligence firms.

notes: Church famously warned about intelligence technology capacity for tyranny - "the
  abyss from which there is no return." While successfully exposing abuses, reforms
  inadvertently pushed operations into private sector. Public hearings September-October
  1975 were nationally televised. Final report called "most extensive review of intelligence
  activities ever made available to the public."
