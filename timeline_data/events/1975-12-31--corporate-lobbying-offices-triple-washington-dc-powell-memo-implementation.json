  "title": "Corporate Public Affairs Offices Triple in Washington DC Following Powell Memo Implementation",
  "summary": "By the end of 1975, corporate public affairs offices in Washington DC had tripled from approximately 100 in 1968 to over 300, representing a dramatic expansion of corporate political influence following the Powell Memo blueprint. This expansion was directly catalyzed by organizations like the Business Roundtable (founded 1972) and Heritage Foundation (founded 1973) implementing Lewis Powell's strategic memorandum for corporate institutional capture. The growth reflected a systematic shift from informal corporate political participation to professionalized, coordinated lobbying infrastructure designed to counter what Powell described as attacks on the free enterprise system. Major corporations established dedicated Washington offices to monitor legislation, coordinate with think tanks, and influence policy development across multiple government agencies. This represented a fundamental transformation in corporate-government relations, laying the groundwork for the complete quintupling of corporate presence that would be achieved by 1978 (reaching over 500 offices), creating the modern corporate lobbying complex that systematically captured regulatory and legislative processes.",
