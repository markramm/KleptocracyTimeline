title: Trump Overrides 25+ Security Clearance Denials for Family and Allies
summary: President Trump overrode security clearance denials for at least 25 individuals
  including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, despite FBI and CIA objections citing foreign
  influence, conflicts of interest, personal conduct, financial problems, and drug use.
  Kushner's clearance was denied due to foreign contacts and business conflicts, with
  career officials warning he could be manipulated by foreign powers. Trump ordered
  Chief of Staff John Kelly to grant the clearance anyway. Whistleblower Tricia Newbold
  testified that the White House retaliated against her for raising concerns, suspending
  her and placing files out of her reach as a person with dwarfism. The 25 overrides
  included two current senior White House officials whose clearances were denied for
  'very serious' disqualifying factors. Carl Kline, who approved the overrides, defied
  congressional subpoenas. This unprecedented bypass of security protocols exposed national
  secrets to compromise, with Kushner later receiving $2 billion from Saudi Arabia after
  leaving office.
