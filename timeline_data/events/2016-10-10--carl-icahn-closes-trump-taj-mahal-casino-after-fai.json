  "summary": "Carl Icahn, who had taken control of Trump Entertainment Resorts in 2014, closed the Trump Taj Mahal casino permanently after failed negotiations with the union representing casino workers. The closure marked the end of Trump's Atlantic City casino empire and Icahn's attempt to make the casino profitable. Despite becoming a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises in 2016, labor disputes made the casino's operation unsustainable.",
