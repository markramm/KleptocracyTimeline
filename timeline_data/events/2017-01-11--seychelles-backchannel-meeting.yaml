  Ally
summary: Erik Prince, founder of military contractor Blackwater and brother of Education
  Secretary Betsy DeVos, met with Putin ally Kirill Dmitriev in Seychelles to establish
  back channel between incoming Trump administration and Kremlin. George Nader told
  Dmitriev that Prince "is designated by Steve [Bannon] to meet you!" Meeting used
  private military contractor rather than official diplomatic channels for sensitive
  international negotiations. Separately, Kushner asked Russian Ambassador Kislyak
  if they could communicate using secure facilities at Russian Embassy, proposing
  to bypass U.S. intelligence entirely.
