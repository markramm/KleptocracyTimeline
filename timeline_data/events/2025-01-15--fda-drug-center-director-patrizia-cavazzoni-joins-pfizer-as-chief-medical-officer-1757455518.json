  "title": "FDA Drug Center Director Patrizia Cavazzoni Joins Pfizer as Chief Medical Officer",
  "summary": "Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, who served as head of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) for seven years, departed the agency in mid-January 2025 and was immediately hired by Pfizer as their new chief medical officer. This represents a classic case of the \"revolving door\" between pharmaceutical regulators and industry, as Cavazzoni had direct oversight of drug approvals that would have affected Pfizer products during her tenure. Her departure follows a pattern where 9 out of 10 FDA commissioners moved to pharmaceutical companies between 2006 and 2019. The timing and immediate transition raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as pharmaceutical companies contribute 45% of FDA total budget and 65% of human drug regulatory activities funding, creating financial dependence that may influence regulatory decisions.",
