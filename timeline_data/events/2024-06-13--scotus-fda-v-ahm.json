  "title": "SCOTUS: No standing in challenge to mifepristone changes (FDA v. AHM)",
  "date": "2024-06-13",
  "importance": 6,
  "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously held the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to challenge FDA's 2016/2021 actions on mifepristone, leaving the agency's changes in place. Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion, with the Court finding that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine failed to demonstrate a concrete injury that would grant them legal standing to challenge the FDA's regulation of the abortion medication. This ruling preserves current access to mifepristone through telemedicine and pharmacies.",
