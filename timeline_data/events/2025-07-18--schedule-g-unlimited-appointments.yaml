title: Schedule G created enabling unlimited political appointments without Senate
summary: Trump issued executive order July 18, 2025, creating Schedule G employment category
  for unlimited political appointees without Senate confirmation. Order fills "gap" beyond
  existing Schedule C's 4,000+ positions for policy-making roles. Max Stier called it "misguided
  attempt to further politicize federal workforce." Don Kettl described it as "blank check"
  undermining 140 years of civil service protections.

notes: 'OPM tasked with establishing regulations. Builds on Schedule Policy/Career (revived
  Schedule F) from day one. Partnership for Public Service: overly complicated system, US already
  has 4,000+ political appointments vs "10s" in other democracies. Second new employment
  classification after Schedule Policy/Career revival. Unprecedented bypass of Senate confirmation.'
