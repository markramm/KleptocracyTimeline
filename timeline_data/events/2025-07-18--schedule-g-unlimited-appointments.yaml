title: "Executive Order creates 'Schedule G' for non-career policy-making/advocating positions"
summary: |
  On July 17, 2025, the White House issued an executive order creating
  'Schedule G' in the excepted service for noncareer policy-making or
  policy-advocating positions. OPM guidance states these appointees require
  White House review and generally depart with the appointing President.
  Supporters call it a fix for a 'gap' in hiring authorities; critics warn it
  erodes merit protections and expands political hiring.
