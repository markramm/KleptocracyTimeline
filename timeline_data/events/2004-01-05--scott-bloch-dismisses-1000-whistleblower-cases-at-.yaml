title: Scott Bloch Dismisses 1,000+ Whistleblower Cases at OSC
summary: Scott Bloch, Special Counsel at the Office of Special Counsel (2004-2008),
  systematically dismantled federal whistleblower protections by dismissing over 1,000
  whistleblower disclosures without investigation. Coalition of whistleblower groups
  documented his 95% dismissal rate, with only 25 of 530 new cases reported to President
  and Congress in FY 2008. Bloch reduced total pending matters at OSC by 56% through
  mass dismissals without proper investigation. He reversed longstanding OSC policy
  protecting federal employees from sexual orientation discrimination, making elimination
  of these protections one of his 'highest and most immediate priorities.' When 12
  OSC staff filed complaints against him for retaliation in 2005, Bloch attempted
  to reassign them to remote field offices. As investigations began, Bloch hired 'Geeks
  on Call' to perform a 'seven-level wipe' of his computers to destroy evidence, leading
  to obstruction of justice charges. He pleaded guilty in 2010 to criminal contempt
  of Congress for destroying evidence and lying under oath. His systematic suppression
  effectively neutered the OSC's mission to protect federal whistleblowers during
  critical Bush administration years.
