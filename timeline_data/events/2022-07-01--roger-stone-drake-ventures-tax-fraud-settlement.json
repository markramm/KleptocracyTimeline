  "notes": "Drake Ventures LLC exemplifies the sophisticated financial structures Stone used for concealment. Despite having no legitimate business operations, website, or independent phone number, the company processed hundreds of thousands in payments while Stone owed the IRS nearly $2 million. When facing collection, Stone transferred assets to the Bertran Family Revocable Trust, including a Fort Lauderdale property purchased with a $400,000 mortgage obtained while owing millions in taxes. The DOJ documented these as \"fraudulent transfers\" designed to evade tax collection. While not directly involving Russian money, these structures demonstrate Stone's comfort with complex schemes to conceal assets and avoid oversightâ€”capabilities useful for his intelligence-related activities."
