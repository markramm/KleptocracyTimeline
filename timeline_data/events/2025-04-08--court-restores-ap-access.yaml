title: Judge orders restoration of AP access to White House events
date: '2025-04-08'
importance: 5
summary: A federal judge on April 8, 2025, ordered the White House to restore Associated
  Press access to cover presidential events, finding that the administration's February
  ban constituted viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.
  The ruling came after AP was barred from White House coverage following critical
  reporting. The administration responded by restructuring the press pool system days
  later to circumvent the court order.

notes: This ruling preceded the April 15 press pool restructuring where the White
  House eliminated the permanent wire service position, effectively circumventing
  the court's order to restore AP access. Part of broader pattern of press suppression.
