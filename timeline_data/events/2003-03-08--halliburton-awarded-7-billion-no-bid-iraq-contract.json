  "title": "Halliburton Awarded $7 Billion No-Bid Iraq Contract",
  "summary": "Halliburton subsidiary KBR was secretly awarded a $7 billion no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure, just days before the invasion began. The contract was awarded by the Army Corps of Engineers without competitive bidding, citing 'emergency circumstances.' Vice President Dick Cheney, Halliburton's former CEO who still received deferred compensation from the company, denied involvement in the contract award despite emails showing his office coordinated with the Pentagon. A Pentagon audit later found KBR overcharged the government by $61 million for gasoline and $67 million for dining services. The no-bid contract violated federal procurement regulations and represented a massive conflict of interest, enriching the Vice President's former company through a war he advocated for based on false intelligence.",
