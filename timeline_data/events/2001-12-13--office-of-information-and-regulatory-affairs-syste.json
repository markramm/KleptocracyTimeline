  "title": "Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Systematically Subordinated to Corporate Input",
  "summary": "The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) implemented new procedures requiring all federal agencies to submit proposed regulations to corporate 'stakeholder panels' before internal government review. The panels, dominated by industry representatives, gained power to rewrite regulatory language and delay implementation indefinitely. Career OIRA staff documented that over 60% of environmental and financial regulations were substantially weakened or abandoned after corporate panel input. The process effectively transferred regulatory authority from democratically accountable agencies to unelected corporate representatives, institutionalizing systematic corporate capture of the regulatory state.",
