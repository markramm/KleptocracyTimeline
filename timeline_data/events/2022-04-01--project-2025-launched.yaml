notes: Most comprehensive conservative governing blueprint in modern history. Despite
  Trump distancing himself during campaign, after winning 2024 election he nominated
  several Project 2025 architects to positions. Four days into second term, Time found
  nearly two-thirds of Trump's executive actions "mirror or partially mirror" Project
  2025 proposals. CNN found 36 of 53 first-week orders matched Heritage Foundation's
  brief.
