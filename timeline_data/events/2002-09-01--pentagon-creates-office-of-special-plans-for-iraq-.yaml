title: Pentagon Creates Office of Special Plans for Iraq Intelligence Manipulation
summary: Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith created the Office of Special Plans
  to manipulate intelligence on Iraq-al Qaeda relationships that were 'inconsistent
  with the consensus of the Intelligence Community.' Directed by Abram Shulsky, the
  OSP systematically cherry-picked intelligence to support predetermined policy positions,
  presenting 'unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent' intelligence as
  factual to senior Bush officials. The Pentagon Inspector General found OSP activities
  were 'inappropriate' as they bypassed normal CIA and DIA intelligence processes,
  presenting unvetted raw intelligence directly to administration officials without
  proper intelligence community coordination. The office developed briefings with
  'conclusions that were not fully supported by available intelligence' and assembled
  'unreliable' intelligence to make stronger cases for Iraq-al Qaeda links than the
  Intelligence Community assessed. The Senate Intelligence Committee found the administration
  'repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated,
  contradicted, or even non-existent.' OSP operated without knowledge of the Intelligence
  Community or State Department, undermining CIA credibility by stating CIA interpretations
  'ought to be ignored.' This systematic intelligence manipulation helped justify
  the Iraq invasion through what investigations revealed as coordinated deception.
