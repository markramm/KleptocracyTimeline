  "title": "Systematic Government Agency Weaponization Infrastructure Acceleration Enables Comprehensive Institutional Capture and Democratic Erosion",
  "summary": "The systematic acceleration of government agency weaponization infrastructure beginning with Trump administration represents the comprehensive institutionalization of institutional capture mechanisms that transform democratic government apparatus into systematic political weapons for oligarchic control. The weaponization infrastructure builds on WHIG precedents for crisis exploitation, oversight destruction, and institutional coordination to create systematic deployment of FBI, IRS, CIA, DOJ, and intelligence community resources against political opponents through coordinated institutional capture rather than episodic crisis operations. This represents systematic evolution from WHIG's crisis-accelerated institutional manipulation to permanent weaponization infrastructure where government agencies systematically operate as political weapons independent of democratic accountability, constitutional constraints, and legal limitations through established precedent-based authority claims. The systematic weaponization demonstrates completion of institutional capture template: government apparatus transformed from democratic service institutions into systematic oligarchic control mechanisms that target political opponents, suppress dissent, and eliminate constitutional constraints through coordinated agency deployment operating continuously rather than requiring crisis conditions. This systematic institutional weaponization creates permanent infrastructure for democratic erosion through government apparatus capture that operates independently of electoral outcomes and democratic oversight.",
