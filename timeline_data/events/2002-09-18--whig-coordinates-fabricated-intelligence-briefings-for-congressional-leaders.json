    "title": "White House Iraq Group Systematically Manipulates Congressional Intelligence Briefings",
    "summary": "The White House Iraq Group (WHIG), led by Karl Rove and coordinating with top administration officials like Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice, conducted a deliberate campaign to mislead Congress about Iraq's weapons capabilities. They systematically fabricated intelligence claims about WMDs and al-Qaeda connections, omitting contradictory evidence and pressuring intelligence analysts. The Senate Intelligence Committee later found that these briefings significantly overstated threats not supported by underlying intelligence, representing a critical breach of constitutional oversight.",
    "description": "WHIG coordinates with CIA and Pentagon to provide congressional leaders with intelligence briefings containing systematically fabricated claims about Iraqi WMD capabilities and Al-Qaeda connections. The briefings deliberately omit all contradictory intelligence and dissenting analysis from the intelligence community.",
    "significance": "Systematic deception of Congress undermines constitutional separation of powers and prevents informed legislative decision-making on matters of war and national security.",
