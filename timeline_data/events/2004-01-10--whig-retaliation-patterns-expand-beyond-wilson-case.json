  "date": "2004-01-10",
  "description": "The White House Iraq Group systematically expands its retaliation apparatus beyond the Joseph Wilson case to target multiple administration critics including Richard Clarke, Paul O'Neill, Scott Ritter, and other intelligence professionals who challenge Iraq War justifications. This expansion demonstrates institutional evolution from individual retaliation to systematic suppression of all dissent, using coordinated character assassination campaigns, security clearance revocations, career destruction, and legal harassment. The systematic nature of these operations reveals WHIG as the institutional center for weaponizing government power against truthtellers across multiple agencies and domains.",
