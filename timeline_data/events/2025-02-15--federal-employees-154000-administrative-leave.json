  "notes": "The Deferred Resignation Program represents a calculated strategy to accelerate the replacement of career civil servants with political loyalists. By placing 154,000 employees on paid administrative leave while they await buyouts, the administration effectively removes institutional knowledge and expertise while maintaining the fiction of voluntary departures. Combined with the 59,000 jobs already eliminated and Schedule F reclassifications, this creates space for wholesale replacement of the federal workforce with politically aligned appointees. The scale exceeds any previous administration's workforce changes.",
