  "summary": "Lewis Powell, two months before Supreme Court nomination, sends confidential memo to U.S. Chamber of Commerce titled \"Attack On American Free Enterprise System.\" The memo outlines systematic plan for corporate coordination to capture key institutions including courts, media, and universities through \"long-range planning,\" \"joint effort,\" and \"united action through national organizations.\" Scholars like David Harvey and Gary Gerstle describe it as a neoliberal blueprint for institutional transformation, leading to exponential growth of corporate political infrastructure.",
