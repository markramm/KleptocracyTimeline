title: January 6th Committee Reveals Social Media Platforms Gave Special Treatment
  to Conservatives
summary: January 6th Committee investigation found tech platforms systematically bent
  rules to avoid penalizing conservative content out of fear of political reprisals.
  Internal documents revealed Facebook maintained "white lists" exempting conservative
  accounts (Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Glenn Beck, Gateway Pundit) from fact-checking.
  Twitter employees warned of potential violence on January 5th but failed to act
  due to fear of deactivating Trump's account. Platforms only took action after January
  6th attack.
