notes: 'This tariff weaponizes trade policy to enforce US foreign policy preferences
  on sovereign nations. India, like many countries, continues buying discounted Russian
  oil for energy security and economic reasons. The specific exemption for Apple products
  reveals the corrupt bargain: punishment for nations that defy US geopolitical demands,
  but protection for US corporations profiting from those same nations. This establishes
  a framework to economically punish any country maintaining normal trade with Russia,
  effectively trying to impose US sanctions policy globally through tariffs rather
  than diplomacy.'
