title: Bill Barr Intervenes to Reduce Sentences for Trump Allies Stone and Flynn
summary: Attorney General Bill Barr personally intervened to reduce sentencing recommendations
  for Trump allies Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, causing four career prosecutors
  to withdraw from Stone's case in protest and one to resign from DOJ entirely. After
  prosecutors recommended 7-9 years for Stone's witness tampering and lying to Congress,
  Barr overruled them following a Trump tweet calling the sentence 'horrible and unfair.'
  Barr then moved to dismiss charges against Flynn despite his guilty plea for lying
  to the FBI. Over 2,000 former DOJ officials signed a letter calling for Barr's resignation,
  stating he 'assaulted the rule of law.' Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan accused Barr
  of a 'gross abuse of prosecutorial power.' This politicization of justice marked
  an unprecedented use of DOJ to protect presidential allies from criminal consequences.
