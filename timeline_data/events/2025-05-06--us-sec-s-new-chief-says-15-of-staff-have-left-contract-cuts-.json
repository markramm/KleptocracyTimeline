  "title": "US SEC's new chief says 15% of staff have left, contract cuts to come",
  "summary": "The Trump administration has rapidly transformed the Securities and Exchange Commission through targeted staff reductions, with approximately 15% of staff already departed and plans for further contract cuts. The administration has implemented a $50,000 voluntary separation offer and imposed a hiring freeze, dramatically reducing the agency's workforce and potentially compromising its regulatory oversight capabilities.",
  "description": "The chairman of the SEC confirmed that 15% of the financial sector watchdog agency has been purged by the Trump administration, with more to come. The cuts include a voluntary separation program offering $50,000 to employees and a strict hiring freeze that allows only one new hire for every four employees who leave.",
