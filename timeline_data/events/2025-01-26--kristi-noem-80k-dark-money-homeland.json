Pattern of monetizing public office continues at DHS overseeing $90 billion budget.",

  "notes": "Noem's secret $80,000 dark money payments reveal pattern of treating public office as personal ATM. Taking 10% cut of funds raised echoes mob protection rackets. Previous abuse includes forcing state officials to approve daughter's denied appraiser license and using state plane for personal trips. Failure to disclose on federal forms suggests consciousness of guilt. Now oversees $90 billion DHS budget with massive contracting opportunities for enrichment.",
