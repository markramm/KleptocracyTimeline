title: GAO says NIH grant delays violated the Impoundment Control Act
date: '2025-08-05'
summary: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined on August 5, 2025, that HHS
  and NIH illegally froze approximately 1,800 medical research grants in violation of the
  Impoundment Control Act. The Trump administration's delay of these congressionally
  appropriated funds for medical research constituted an unlawful withholding of funds
  that Congress had directed to be spent.
