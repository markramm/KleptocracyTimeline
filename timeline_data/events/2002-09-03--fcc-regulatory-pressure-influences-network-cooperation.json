  "date": "2002-09-03",
  "description": "Federal Communications Commission regulatory pressures and implied licensing threats create systematic incentives for television networks to cooperate with government messaging and avoid challenging administration narratives. Network executives recognize that maintaining positive relationships with the administration provides regulatory advantages while adversarial coverage could result in licensing complications, merger difficulties, and other regulatory obstacles. This regulatory capture mechanism transforms supposedly independent media oversight into government propaganda facilitation, demonstrating how regulatory agencies can systematically compromise media independence through licensing leverage.",
