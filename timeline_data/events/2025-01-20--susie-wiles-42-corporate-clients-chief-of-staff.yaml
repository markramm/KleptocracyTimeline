notes: Wiles's appointment places a corporate lobbyist with extensive industry ties
  at the center of White House power. Her clients included companies fighting environmental
  cleanup, public health measures, and safety regulations - directly conflicting with
  stated administration goals. Republic Services sought to avoid removing radioactive
  waste, Swisher fought youth tobacco restrictions despite MAHA agenda, and Northern
  Dynasty wanted permits for environmentally devastating Pebble Mine. This represents
  unprecedented corporate access to presidential decision-making.
