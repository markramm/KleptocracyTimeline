  "description": "In the critical lead-up to the Iraq authorization vote, WHIG systematically withholds all intelligence reports that contradict administration claims about Iraqi WMD programs and terrorist connections. Congressional intelligence committees receive only carefully cherry-picked intelligence that supports the war narrative.",
  "significance": "Deliberate withholding of contradictory evidence prevents informed congressional deliberation on war authorization, violating the constitutional requirement for executive accountability to the legislative branch.",
