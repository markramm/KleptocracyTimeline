title: World Liberty Financial Sells $25 Million in Tokens Days Before DOJ Crypto
  Unit Disbanded
summary: Trump's World Liberty Financial sold $25 million worth of tokens to Dubai-based
  DWF Labs on April 4, 2025, just three days before Trump's Justice Department announced
  disbanding of team that previously investigated crypto fraud cases. The Trump family
  holds 60% stake in World Liberty Financial and has earned approximately $500 million
  from the crypto platform.
description: Accountable.US research revealed the $25 million transaction between
  World Liberty Financial and DWF Labs, a firm previously suspected of fraud. The
  timing raised concerns about quid pro quo arrangements, with the crypto purchase
  occurring immediately before DOJ dismantled its crypto fraud investigation unit.
  DT Marks DEFI LLC, linked to the Trump family, has rights to 75% of revenues from
  token sales. The transaction is part of pattern where crypto firms make large investments
  then receive favorable regulatory treatment.
