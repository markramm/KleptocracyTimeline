title: Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak tries to avoid security detail for Epstein
  island visits
summary: Leaked emails show former Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak actively trying
  to prevent his security detail from accompanying him to Epstein's private island.
  In January 2014, Barak emailed stating he was still trying to arrange that the security
  guys will NOT come with them to the island. As Defense Minister overseeing Unit
  8200 (Israel's NSA), Barak's efforts to avoid official oversight during visits to
  a known trafficking site raises serious intelligence concerns about what activities
  required such secrecy.
