title: Tobacco industry Operation Berkshire coordinates international intelligence
  operations
summary: Operation Berkshire, initiated in 1976 by seven major tobacco companies including
  British American Tobacco, coordinated international intelligence operations through
  front organizations like ICOSI/INFOTAB to conduct surveillance of anti-tobacco
  groups and promote controversy over smoking health effects, demonstrating early
  corporate exploitation of intelligence privatization.

notes: 'Operation Berkshire began with a December 1976 proposal by Imperial Tobacco''s
  Tony Garrett to coordinate a "defensive strategy" against smoking health concerns.
  The conspiracy culminated in a secret June 1977 meeting at Shockerwick House where
  CEOs from Philip Morris, BAT, R.J. Reynolds, and other major tobacco companies agreed
  to create front organizations like ICOSI (later INFOTAB) to monitor anti-tobacco
  groups and promote scientific controversy despite internal acknowledgment of smoking''s
  health risks. This represents an early example of corporate intelligence privatization
  being used to circumvent accountability structures.'
