notes: Operation Berkshire exemplifies how corporate interests immediately exploited
  the regulatory vacuum created by intelligence reforms, conducting private operations
  that would have been illegal for government agencies to perform. Demonstrates how
  private intelligence operations could conduct surveillance and disinformation campaigns
  that would violate legal restrictions on government agencies, exploiting regulatory
  gaps created by intelligence reforms.
