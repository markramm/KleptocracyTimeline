  "summary": "House January 6th Committee's second hearing revealed Trump raised $250 million post-election through fraudulent \"Official Election Defense Fund\" that never existed. Committee found Trump's team sent up to 25 fraudulent fundraising emails daily, raising $100 million in first week after election loss. Only small fraction went to election challenges; most funded Trump's Save America PAC, paid campaign debts, and enriched Trump properties. Committee member Zoe Lofgren stated \"The Big Lie was also a big rip-off.\"",
