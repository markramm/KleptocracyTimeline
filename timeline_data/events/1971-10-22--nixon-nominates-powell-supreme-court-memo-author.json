  "title": "Nixon Nominates Lewis Powell to Supreme Court Two Months After Corporate Blueprint Memo",
  "summary": "President Nixon nominates Lewis F. Powell Jr. to the Supreme Court just two months after Powell authored his secret corporate blueprint memo to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on August 23, 1971. The memo, which advocates for systematic corporate capture of universities, media, courts, and politics, remains confidential during Powell's confirmation hearings and is not discovered until leaked to Jack Anderson in September 1972. This nomination represents the placement of corporate capture architect directly onto the nation's highest court, creating the opportunity for Powell to implement his own blueprint through constitutional interpretation.",
