title: Trump Fires 17 Inspectors General Including Those Investigating Musk Companies
summary: President Trump fired 17 inspectors general on Friday night January 24, 2025,
  including Defense Department IG Robert Storch who was reviewing SpaceX compliance
  with federal reporting protocols, and Agriculture Department IG Phyllis Fong who
  had launched an investigation of Musk's Neuralink startup. The firings violated
  federal law requiring 30 days notice to Congress with substantive explanations.
description: The mass firing of 17 independent watchdogs occurred via late-night emails
  from White House Presidential Personnel Office Director Sergio Gor stating "due
  to changing priorities your position is terminated, effective immediately." Among
  those fired were inspectors general at Defense, State, HUD, Veterans Affairs, Energy,
  and Transportation departments. The firings prompted lawsuits and violated the 2022
  law requiring 30-day Congressional notice with case-specific reasons.
