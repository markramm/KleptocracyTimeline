  "title": "SEC Creates Consolidated Supervised Entities Program Allowing Unlimited Investment Bank Leverage",
  "summary": "The SEC establishes the Consolidated Supervised Entities (CSE) program under Chair William Donaldson, eliminating the 12-to-1 leverage limit that had constrained broker-dealers and investment banks since 1975. The program allows firms with over  billion in assets\u2014Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley\u2014to leverage themselves unlimited times. These firms quickly increase leverage to 30-40 times their equity, making them extraordinarily vulnerable to market shocks. The program removes capital cushion requirements and essentially allows self-regulation. Former SEC official Lee Pickard, who helped write the original 1975 limits, later stated: \"The SEC gave up the very protections that caused these firms to go under.\" All five firms collapsed or required bailouts during the 2008 crisis.",
