  "title": "Stephen Miller demands 3,000 daily ICE arrests, triggers leadership purge",
  "summary": "Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem held a tense meeting at ICE headquarters demanding field offices achieve 3,000 daily arrestsâ€”triple the early administration numbers. Miller threatened to fire the bottom 10% of directors monthly if quotas weren't met. A week later, Kenneth Genalo (33-year ICE veteran) was forced to retire and Robert Hammer (20-year HSI veteran) was reassigned for failing to meet the impossible quotas. The day before the purge, agents achieved only 1,600 arrests, well short of Miller's demands.",
