title: 75,000 federal employees accept buyouts through Deferred Resignation Program
summary: Deferred Resignation Program sees 75,000 federal employees accept buyouts
  by mid-February out of 2 million offered, representing less than 4% participation
  versus administration's initial expectation of 200,000 (5-10%). Employees retain
  full pay through September 2025 without work requirements, accelerating career civil
  service exodus while facing legal challenges from federal unions.
