title: Rex Tillerson ExxonMobil CEO Becomes Secretary of State
summary: Rex Tillerson, former ExxonMobil CEO who received Putin's Order of Friendship
  for Russian energy deals and maintained 45 million in oil investments, became Secretary
  of State despite unprecedented opposition. Tillerson had negotiated a 00 billion
  Arctic drilling deal with Russia's Rosneft that was blocked by sanctions he would
  oversee lifting. He dismantled the State Department, leaving 60% of top diplomat
  positions vacant, firing career officials, and proposing 31% budget cuts. Tillerson
  used private email for classified information, refused to spend 20 million allocated
  to counter Russian interference, and was fired via tweet after calling Trump a 'moron.'
  His tenure marked the most severe diplomatic capacity reduction in State Department
  history.
