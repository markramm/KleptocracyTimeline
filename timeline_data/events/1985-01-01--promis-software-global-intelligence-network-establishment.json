  "title": "PROMIS Software Creates Global Intelligence Surveillance Network Through Maxwell Distribution",
  "summary": "The systematic distribution of backdoored PROMIS software through Robert Maxwell and other intermediaries creates an unprecedented global surveillance network, with intelligence agencies in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala, Colombia, Nicaragua, Bulgaria, Egypt, East Germany, Poland, Belgium, Turkey, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Soviet KGB unknowingly using compromised software. The Soviets and Eastern European allies use PROMIS to spy on the U.S. State Department and 170 American embassies worldwide, while Western intelligence simultaneously monitors their activities through the software's hidden backdoors, creating a complex web of mutual surveillance and counter-intelligence operations.",
