  "title": "Exxon Internal Climate Research Program Confirms Human-Caused Global Warming",
  "summary": "Senior Exxon scientist James Black delivered a sobering message to company executives about carbon dioxide warming the planet, marking the beginning of documented internal knowledge at Exxon about climate change risks. Internal research from 1977-1982 created remarkably accurate climate models predicting global temperature increases from fossil fuel emissions. A 1982 internal report to Exxon management stated that consequences could be \"catastrophic\" and that significant fossil fuel consumption reductions would be necessary. One 1981 memo from manager Roger Cohen acknowledged the company's long-term business plans could \"produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the earth's population).\" Later Harvard analysis found 63-83% of ExxonMobil's internal climate projections were accurate, projecting 0.20 degrees Celsius warming per decade with margin of error of 0.04 degrees - a trend that proved largely correct.",
