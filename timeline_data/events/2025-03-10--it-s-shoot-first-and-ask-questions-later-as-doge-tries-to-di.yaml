summary: |
  Department of Government Efficiency attempted to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection
  Bureau through mass firings, but federal judges blocked the action and ordered reinstatement

  Multiple judges ruled the firings violated due process and federal law, forcing the Trump
  administration to reinstate nearly 25,000 workers across various agencies.
