summary: Trump removed David Huitema as OGE Director on February 10, 2025, less than
  two months after he was sworn in following Senate confirmation. Huitema, appointed
  to a five-year term by Biden and confirmed in November 2024, was notified via Friday
  night email. He stated Trump "doesn't want OGE or really anyone with an independent
  voice to address concerns." Trump appointed VA Secretary Doug Collins as acting
  director. The firing followed Trump's removal of 17+ inspectors general two weeks
  earlier, continuing his pattern of eliminating independent oversight positions.
