  "title": "WHIG Launches Targeted Deception Campaigns Against Congressional War Skeptics",
  "summary": "The White House Iraq Group implements targeted deception campaigns against key congressional skeptics of the Iraq invasion, using customized intelligence presentations and political pressure to neutralize legislative opposition. WHIG identifies influential war skeptics including Senators Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, and Carl Levin, along with Representatives John Conyers, Dennis Kucinich, and Barbara Lee, then develops specific strategies to undermine their opposition through fabricated intelligence tailored to their particular concerns. For senators focused on constitutional war powers, WHIG provides fabricated assessments claiming imminent threat requiring immediate action; for representatives concerned about civilian casualties, WHIG presents false intelligence about Saddam's alleged WMD targeting of population centers. The group coordinates with Republican leadership to ensure skeptical legislators receive private briefings featuring the most alarming (and fabricated) intelligence, while using party discipline and political pressure to isolate skeptics from mainstream Democratic leadership. WHIG's targeting of congressional skeptics represents the systematic corruption of democratic deliberation, transforming legitimate policy debate into orchestrated manipulation designed to eliminate opposition voices. This targeting demonstrates how WHIG's deception campaign specifically sought to neutralize constitutional checks and balances by corrupting the legislative process at the individual level.",
