notes: This represents a dramatic escalation in Trump's efforts to control the Federal
  Reserve. The Fed was specifically designed to be independent from political pressure,
  with governors serving 14-year terms that span multiple presidencies. Trump's claim
  of "mortgage fraud" as cause for firing appears to be a pretext for removing a governor
  who might oppose his preferred monetary policies. Cook's refusal to step down sets
  up a constitutional crisis over the independence of monetary policy.
