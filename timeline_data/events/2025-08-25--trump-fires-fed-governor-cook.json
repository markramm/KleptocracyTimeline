  "summary": "In unprecedented move, Trump attempts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook citing mortgage fraud allegations, marking first time in Fed's 111-year histor...",
  "description": "President Trump sends letter firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing William Pulte's mortgage fraud allegations as cause. This unprecedented action shatters central bank independence - Fed governors can only be removed for proven malfeasance, not unproven allegations. Cook, the first Black woman on Fed Board, immediately sues Trump, stating \"no cause exists under the law\" and refusing to resign. Markets react negatively to attack on Fed independence. Trump's action follows Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as he demands. Constitutional scholars call this direct assault on separation of powers, as Federal Reserve Act requires actual cause for removal, not politically motivated accusations.",

  "notes": "This represents a dramatic escalation in Trump's efforts to control the Federal Reserve. The Fed was specifically designed to be independent from political pressure, with governors serving 14-year terms that span multiple presidencies. Trump's claim of \"mortgage fraud\" as cause for firing appears to be a pretext for removing a governor who might oppose his preferred monetary policies. Cook's refusal to step down sets up a constitutional crisis over the independence of monetary policy.",
