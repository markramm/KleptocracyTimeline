notes: 'The 5-bedroom mansion with pool was located at the end of a private cul-de-sac
  overlooking Lake Worth Lagoon and Tarpon Island. Trump and Epstein became friendly
  shortly after this purchase, with Trump stating in 2002: "I''ve known Jeff for
  fifteen years." The property later became the site of reported child sex abuse.
  After Epstein''s death, the mansion was sold in 2021 for $18.5 million and demolished,
  with the address changed from 358 to 360 El Brillo Way.'
