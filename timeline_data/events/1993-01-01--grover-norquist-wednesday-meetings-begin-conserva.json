  "title": "Grover Norquist Wednesday Meetings Begin - Conservative Coordination Hub",
  "summary": "Grover Norquist launched his weekly Wednesday Meeting series at Americans for Tax Reform headquarters, initially to help fight President Clinton's healthcare plan. The meetings became \"the Grand Central station of the conservative movement\" and \"a must-attend event for Republican operatives.\" The weekly gatherings included over 150 participants: Republican congressional leaders, right-leaning think tanks, conservative advocacy groups, and K Street lobbyists. After George W. Bush's election, a White House aide attended each week, and Vice President Cheney sent his own representative. These meetings served as a key coordination mechanism, \"establishing relations of exchange\" among conservative subgroups and \"sustaining a moral community of conservative activists.\" ATR helped establish similar meetings nationwide, creating 51 center-right meetings in 45 states, forming a nationwide network for coordinating conservative initiatives like tax cuts and deregulation.",
