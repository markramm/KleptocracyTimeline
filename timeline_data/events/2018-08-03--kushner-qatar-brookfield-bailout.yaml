title: Qatar-Linked Brookfield Bails Out Kushner's 666 Fifth Avenue for $1.28 Billion
summary: Brookfield Asset Management, with Qatar Investment Authority as second-largest
  investor, paid $1.28 billion for 99-year lease on Kushner's troubled 666 Fifth Avenue
  property. Deal came after Charles Kushner's April 2017 request for Qatari financing
  was rejected, followed by Jared advising Trump to support Saudi/UAE blockade of
  Qatar against State Department objections. The bailout resolved Kushner family's
  looming $1.4 billion mortgage default, raising serious foreign influence and emoluments
  concerns.

notes: Timeline of Qatar financing rejection, blockade support, then bailout raises
  questions of foreign policy being influenced by personal financial interests. Deal
  effectively eliminated Kushner family's biggest financial liability while Jared
  served as senior White House advisor.
