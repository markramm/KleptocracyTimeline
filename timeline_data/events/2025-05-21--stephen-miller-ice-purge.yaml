title: Stephen Miller orchestrates mass purge of veteran ICE officials over arrest quotas
summary: Stephen Miller held meeting demanding 3,000 daily arrests, resulting in forced "retirement" of Kenneth Genalo (33-year ICE veteran) and reassignment of Robert Hammer (20-year HSI veteran) for failing to meet impossible quotas. Multiple field office directors were replaced, with Miller threatening to fire the bottom 10% of directors monthly based solely on arrest numbers, regardless of legal constraints or operational realities.

notes: The 3,000 daily arrest quota was mathematically impossible given ICE resources and legal requirements. Veterans who explained operational constraints were immediately terminated, replaced with political loyalists willing to violate law to meet quotas.
