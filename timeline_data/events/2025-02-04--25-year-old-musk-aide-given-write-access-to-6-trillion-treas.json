  "title": "25-Year-Old Musk Aide Given Write Access to $6 Trillion Treasury Payment System",
  "summary": "Marko Elez, a 25-year-old engineer linked to Elon Musk, was granted administrative privileges including ability to write code for Treasury Department's Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payments System (SPS) that handle $6 trillion annually in Social Security, Medicare, and government contractor payments. Career official David Lebryk was placed on leave after resisting the access grant. Elez later resigned after racist social media posts were discovered, but Musk publicly supported his rehiring.",
  "description": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel unprecedented access to critical payment systems. Elez had full administrative privileges to modify code in systems handling all federal payments. After racist posts were discovered on his social media, Elez resigned, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with backing from Trump and VP Vance. The Treasury Inspector General launched an audit of security controls after Democratic lawmakers raised alarms about the access.",
