title: State Department plans $400 million payment to Tesla after regulatory firings
summary: The State Department announced plans to pay Tesla $400 million for unspecified
  services, coming weeks after Trump systematically fired federal officials investigating
  Elon Musk's companies. The payment followed the removal of FDA staffers reviewing
  Neuralink, EEOC leaders investigating Tesla discrimination, the NLRB Chair pursuing
  SpaceX complaints, and CFPB staff examining Musk's financial ventures. This represented
  a direct quid pro quo where regulatory relief was followed by massive government
  payments to Musk's companies.
