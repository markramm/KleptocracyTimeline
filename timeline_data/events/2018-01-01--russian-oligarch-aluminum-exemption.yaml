title: Putin-Linked Company Receives Tariff Exemption Until Public Outcry
summary: A U.S. subsidiary of a sanctioned Russian oligarch's business quietly received
  an exemption from aluminum tariffs under Trump. Only after a congressional inquiry
  spearheaded by Senator Elizabeth Warren exposed the deal did the administration
  revoke the special treatment. The Kremlin-tied firm was initially granted a break
  despite U.S. sanctions.
