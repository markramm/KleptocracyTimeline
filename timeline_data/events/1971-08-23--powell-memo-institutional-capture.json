  "title": "Lewis Powell Authors Strategic Memorandum for Corporate Institutional Capture",
  "summary": "Lewis Powell mailed a confidential, strategic memorandum titled 'Attack On American Free Enterprise System' to Eugene B. Sydnor Jr. at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The document outlined a systematic plan for corporations to defend and expand their power by capturing courts, academia, and media through long-term, coordinated strategies. This memo became a foundational blueprint for conservative institutional capture, directly influencing the creation of organizations like the Heritage Foundation, Business Roundtable, and American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Later investigations revealed how this strategy enabled a comprehensive corporate infiltration of American democratic institutions, creating a revolving door between think tanks, industries, and government regulatory bodies.",
