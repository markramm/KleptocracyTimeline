  "title": "Lewis Powell Authors Strategic Memorandum for Corporate Institutional Capture",
  "summary": "Lewis Powell mailed a confidential, strategic memorandum titled 'Attack On American Free Enterprise System' to Eugene B. Sydnor Jr. at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The document outlined a systematic plan for corporations to defend and expand their power by capturing courts, academia, and media through long-term, coordinated strategies. This memo became a foundational blueprint for conservative institutional capture, directly influencing the creation of organizations like the Heritage Foundation, Business Roundtable, and American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).",
