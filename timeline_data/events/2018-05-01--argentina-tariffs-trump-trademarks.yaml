title: U.S. Lifts Argentina Tariffs While Trump Seeks Trademarks
summary: Trump administration exempted Argentina from steel and aluminum tariffs in
  May 2018 while Trump Organization was seeking trademark approvals in Argentina.
  After securing two trademarks in November 2019, the administration abruptly reinstated
  tariffs on Argentina weeks later, citing dubious "currency manipulation" claims.
  Ethics experts concluded this showed "President Trump is for sale."
