title: Supreme Court Strikes Down CDC Eviction Moratorium as Unauthorized Executive
  Action
summary: The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to block the Biden administration's CDC eviction
  moratorium covering areas with high COVID transmission, finding the agency exceeded
  its statutory authority. The Court held that '[i]f a federally imposed eviction
  moratorium is to continue, Congress must specifically authorize it.' President Biden
  had acknowledged the legal vulnerability when issuing the August 3 order, admitting
  'I can't guarantee you the court won't rule we don't have that authority,' but proceeded
  to buy time for rental assistance distribution. The moratorium, challenged by the
  Alabama Association of Realtors, was costing landlords $19 billion monthly. This
  decision, along with the OSHA mandate ruling, established precedent limiting executive
  agency emergency powers without explicit Congressional authorization.
