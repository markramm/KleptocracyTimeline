  "notes": "Gulf states previously pushed Trump for new nuclear deal, not strikes. Saudi-Iran restored diplomatic ties 2023 after China-brokered talks. 2019 Iran attack on Saudi oil facilities was \"turning point\" pushing Saudis toward detente. Gulf states feared strikes would disrupt oil production, block Strait of Hormuz shipping. Renad Mansour (Chatham House): \"The gulf largely has a business-first mindset, and instability is bad for business.\" Iran threatened retaliation against US troops in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi, UAE."
