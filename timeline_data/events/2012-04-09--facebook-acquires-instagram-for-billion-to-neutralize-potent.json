  "title": "Facebook Acquires Instagram for  Billion to \"Neutralize Potential Competitor\"",
  "summary": "Facebook acquired photo-sharing app Instagram for  billion, implementing what the FTC would later characterize as a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate competitive threats. Internal emails revealed CEO Mark Zuckerberg explicitly stated the acquisition was motivated by a desire to \"neutralize a potential competitor\" rather than enhance services. The FTC approved the acquisition despite its anticompetitive intent, demonstrating regulatory capture as Facebook successfully concealed key information about its monopolistic strategies from regulators. This acquisition established the template for Big Tech companies to systematically purchase and eliminate nascent competitors, fundamentally undermining market competition in social media.",
