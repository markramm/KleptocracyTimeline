  "summary": "Trump's 2025 inauguration raised record $251.4 million, a 142% increase from his 2017 inauguration and quadruple Biden's 2021 total. Corporate donations totaled $161.1 million with 104 businesses giving $1 million or more. Pilgrim's Pride Corp. led with $5 million, Ripple Labs gave $4.9 million. Warren Stephens, who gave $4 million, was appointed UK Ambassador. Only six of hundreds of corporate donors had supported Trump's campaignâ€”most donated only after inauguration benefits became available. The fundraising exceeded all prior inaugurations' total amounts just from million-dollar donors alone.",
