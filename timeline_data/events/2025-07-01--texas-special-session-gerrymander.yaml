title: Texas Democrats Flee State to Block Trump-Requested Mid-Cycle Gerrymandering
summary: Texas Governor Abbott called special session in July 2025 at former President
  Trump's request to eliminate Democratic urban seats through mid-cycle redistricting.
  Most brazen attempt at mid-decade gerrymandering would have created five additional
  Republican districts. House Democrats broke quorum by fleeing state, temporarily
  blocking effort. Unprecedented attempt to redraw maps purely for partisan advantage
  outside normal redistricting cycle. Part of broader pattern of using state power
  to override democratic outcomes and entrench minority rule.

notes: Mid-cycle redistricting historically rare and destabilizing to democratic norms.
  Trump's direct involvement in state redistricting unprecedented. Would have guaranteed
  Republican supermajority despite 50-50 state partisan split.
