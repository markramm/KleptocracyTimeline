title: "Records show at least ~$1.75–$2.0M in Secret Service spending at Trump properties during presidency"
summary: |
  FOIA-released records compiled by watchdogs show the Secret Service spent nearly $2 million
  at Trump-owned properties while protecting the president and his family. A 2020 DHS OIG
  report on the Scotland trip documented specific Turnberry payments but noted incomplete cost
  capture due to system limitations—suggesting totals likely undercount.
notes: |
  Present both: (1) CREW's aggregated FOIA totals; (2) DHS OIG's partial accounting and
  data-limitations caveat. Emphasize that official records may be incomplete.
