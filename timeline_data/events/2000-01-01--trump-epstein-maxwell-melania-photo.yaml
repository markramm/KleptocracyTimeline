notes: 'The 2000 photo was taken at a charity fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and shows the
  social connections within Trump''s Palm Beach circle during the height of the Trump-Epstein
  relationship. This was during the period when Trump famously told New York Magazine
  in 2002: "I''ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He''s a lot of fun
  to be with." The photo documents the social proximity between all four individuals
  before the Trump-Epstein relationship ended around 2004.'
