title: Multiple Pulitzer Prizes Awarded for Exposing Systematic Kleptocratic Corruption
summary: Multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning investigations in 2025 documented systematic
  kleptocratic patterns. Reuters won for "boldly reported expos√©" of systematic regulatory
  failures enabling widespread corruption. Wall Street Journal's national reporting
  prize covered Elon Musk's systematic coordination between business interests and
  political power, including private conversations with Putin. Boston Globe's collaboration
  with Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project showed how "corporate malfeasance,
  personal greed and government neglect led to compromised care and deaths." Awards
  recognize unprecedented journalistic documentation of institutional capture.
