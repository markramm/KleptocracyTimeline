  "title": "Sinclair Broadcast Group Terminates Boris Epshteyn Must-Run Commentary Segments",
  "summary": "Sinclair Broadcast Group announces the end of its controversial must-run political commentary segments, including Boris Epshteyn\"s \"Bottom Line with Boris\" program that had aired 8-9 times per week across 173 local TV stations since April 2017. The decision comes after sustained criticism of Epshteyn\"s pro-Trump propaganda, including his defense of tear-gassing migrant children and segments pushing anti-immigrant smears about child rape. Sinclair states it will replace political commentary with investigative journalism, while moving Epshteyn to a sales-focused role. The termination marks the end of a 2.5-year period where former Trump White House aide Epshteyn delivered nearly 14 minutes of daily partisan content to over 2.2 million households through Sinclair\"s local news monopoly.",
