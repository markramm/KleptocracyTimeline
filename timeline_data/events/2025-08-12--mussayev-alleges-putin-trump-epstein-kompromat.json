  "summary": "Alnur Mussayev, former chief of Kazakhstan's National Security Committee, alleged that Vladimir Putin possesses comprehensive kompromat files on Donald Trump including connections to the Epstein network. Mussayev claims the files contain \"recordings of sexual crimes against minors\" and documentation of financial dealings through sanctioned Russian banks. The allegations connect to the broader pattern of Russian oligarch money flows through Epstein accounts and the presence of Kazakh oligarchs at trafficking-related incidents like the 2010 Savarona yacht scandal.",
