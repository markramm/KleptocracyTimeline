  "title": "Heritage Foundation Established as Powell Memo Implementation Vehicle",
  "summary": "The Heritage Foundation's founding represents a pivotal moment in conservative institutional infrastructure, directly implementing Lewis Powell's 1971 memorandum's strategy for coordinated corporate political influence. Established by Joseph Coors, Paul Weyrich, and Edwin Feulner, the organization pioneered an activist approach to policy research and implementation.",
  "description": "Emerging from the strategic blueprint outlined in the Powell Memorandum, the Heritage Foundation was designed as an aggressive, action-oriented policy research organization. Unlike traditional think tanks, it focused on direct policy influence, marketing research to Congress, policymakers, and media to transform conservative intellectual frameworks into practical governance strategies.",
