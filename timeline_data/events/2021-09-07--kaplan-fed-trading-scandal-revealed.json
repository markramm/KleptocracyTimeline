  "summary": "Wall Street Journal reports Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan made multiple stock trades worth over $1 million during 2020 while orchestrating Fed's COVID-19 pandemic response. Trades included Apple, Delta Air Lines, Occidental Petroleum, and iShares Floating Rate Bond ETFs. Kaplan was instrumental in engineering unprecedented market interventions while simultaneously profiting from individual stock positions, creating systematic conflicts of interest that undermined Federal Reserve independence and public trust in monetary policy decisions during national crisis.",
