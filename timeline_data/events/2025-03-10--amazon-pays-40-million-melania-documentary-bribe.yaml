title: Amazon pays $40 million for Melania documentary in apparent quid pro quo arrangement
summary: Amazon agreed to pay $40 million for a documentary about Melania Trump, a figure far above market rates for similar content. The deal came shortly after Jeff Bezos met with Trump and as Amazon faced multiple federal investigations and regulatory challenges. Industry experts noted typical documentaries of this type command $2-5 million, making the $40 million payment appear to be a thinly veiled bribe. Amazon also agreed to stream old episodes of The Apprentice as part of the arrangement.
