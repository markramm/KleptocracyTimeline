title: DHS Inspector General Reveals Secret Service Deleted January 6th Texts After Oversight Request
summary: DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari disclosed Secret Service erased text
  messages from January 5-6, 2021, during a "device replacement program" after oversight
  officials requested electronic communications. Despite requesting month of records
  for 24 personnel, Secret Service provided only one text exchange. Deletion occurred
  shortly after OIG's February 26, 2021 records request. Congressional leaders condemned
  potential Federal Records Act violations and obstruction of oversight.
