title: Budget Bill Attempts Schedule F Through Financial Coercion of Federal Employees
summary: House version of reconciliation bill contained Section 90002 requiring new
  federal employees to choose between keeping civil service protections while paying
  9.4% of salary toward retirement (versus current 4.4%) or becoming at-will employees
  with no job protections. Senate initially proposed rates up to 14.4%. American Federation
  of Government Employees called it "financial coercion to undermine legal protections"
  creating "no real choice." Provisions ultimately removed after parliamentary challenges
  but revealed intent to restructure civil service along authoritarian lines.

notes: Though provisions raised minimal revenue ($500M annually), inclusion reveals
  revenue generation wasn't primary purpose. Partnership for Public Service warned
  of "devastating impact on government's ability to retain employees and attract talent."
