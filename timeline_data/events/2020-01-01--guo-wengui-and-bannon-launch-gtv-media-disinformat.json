  "title": "Guo Wengui and Bannon Launch GTV Media Disinformation Network",
  "summary": "Guo Wengui and Steve Bannon co-founded GTV Media Group, operating Chinese video website GTV as part of an extensive disinformation network. The platform became a key component of their influence operations, spreading conspiracy theories about COVID-19 origins, promoting false claims about Hunter Biden, and disseminating election fraud narratives that reached Trump's inner circle and major news outlets like the New York Post. The operation utilized sophisticated coordination through volunteer \"ants\" who produced and spread content across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms. GTV served as a mouthpiece for anti-CCP messaging while simultaneously functioning as a vehicle for broader disinformation campaigns targeting American political discourse.",
