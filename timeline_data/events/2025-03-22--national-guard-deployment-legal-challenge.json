    "title": "Federal Courts Rule on National Guard Deployment Constitutionality",
    "summary": "A consolidated panel of federal judges heard critical arguments challenging the president's authority to federalize and deploy National Guard units across multiple states. The hearings revealed profound constitutional tensions surrounding emergency powers, state sovereignty, and executive military deployment. Multiple federal judges, including Judge Karin Immergut in Oregon and Judge Charles Breyer in California, issued temporary restraining orders blocking cross-state National Guard deployments, citing potential violations of the Tenth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act.",
