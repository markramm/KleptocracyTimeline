title: Paul Bremer Order 39 Privatizes Iraq Economy for Foreign Corporations
summary: Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator Paul Bremer signed Order 39
  'Foreign Investment,' imposing unprecedented economic colonization on Iraq by privatizing
  200 state-owned enterprises and permitting 100% foreign ownership in all sectors
  except oil extraction. The order eliminated all tariffs, import taxes, and licensing
  fees while slashing corporate tax rates from 40% to 15% and allowing 100% profit
  repatriation 'without delay.' This created what the Financial Times called 'one
  of the most liberalized economies in the developing world,' allowing foreign corporations
  to 'own every business, do all of the work, and send all of their money home.' The
  transformation violated the 1907 Hague Regulations Article 43 and 1949 Geneva Conventions
  requiring occupying powers to respect existing laws. Oxford Professor Adam Roberts
  warned it 'raises the biggest single question about coalition policy as it relates
  to the laws of war,' while British Attorney General Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair
  the reforms violated international law. The Iraqi Governing Council was excluded
  from consultation and 'severely embarrassed' by the imposition. Unemployment rose
  from 16.8% to 28.1% by end of 2003 as domestic manufacturing was devastated by tariff
  elimination, creating permanent structural dependence on foreign capital and expertise
  through occupation law.
