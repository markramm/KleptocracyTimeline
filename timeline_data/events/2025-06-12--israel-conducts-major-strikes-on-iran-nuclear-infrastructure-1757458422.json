  "title": "Israel Conducts Major Strikes on Iran Nuclear Infrastructure",
  "summary": "Israel carries out coordinated airstrikes targeting Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, military bases, and strategic infrastructure in a surprise integrated operation. The strikes target Iran's strategic triad: nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile systems, and senior leadership, including the assassination of Iran's three top military leaders and several nuclear scientists. This escalation fundamentally alters regional balance of power, exposing Iranian military vulnerabilities while creating strategic opportunities for Saudi Arabia to consolidate regional influence. The operation demonstrates Israel's advanced intelligence capabilities and precision strike capacity, while highlighting Iran's inability to defend its most sensitive installations despite years of defensive preparations.",
