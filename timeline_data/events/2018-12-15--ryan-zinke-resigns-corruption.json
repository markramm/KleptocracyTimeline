  "summary": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned while under at least 18 federal investigations \nfor corruption, conflicts of interest, and ethics violations. Scandals included: \ninvolvement in a Montana land deal benefiting himself and Halliburton chairman, \nusing wildfire funds for personal travel, chartered flights costing $139,000, \nreassigning employees who disagreed with him, meetings with donors during official \ntravel, and his wife using government vehicles. Zinke oversaw the largest reduction \nof protected federal lands in U.S. history, shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-\nEscalante monuments to open them for mining and drilling.\n",

  "notes": "Zinke's replacement, David Bernhardt, was an oil and gas lobbyist with so many \nconflicts of interest he carried a card listing them. This exemplified the Trump \nadministration pattern of appointing industry insiders to dismantle the agencies \nmeant to regulate them. Zinke's reduction of national monuments was later found \nto benefit uranium mining companies that had lobbied for the changes. He was the \nfourth Trump Cabinet member to resign under ethics clouds.\n",
