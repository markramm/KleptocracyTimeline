title: DOJ Releases Memo Declaring No Epstein "Client List" Exists
summary: The DOJ released a two-page memo on July 7, 2025, declaring "no incriminating
  'client list'" existed, that Epstein died by suicide, and that "no further disclosure
  would be appropriate or warranted." This directly contradicted Attorney General
  Bondi's February statement about having a "client list" on her desk.
