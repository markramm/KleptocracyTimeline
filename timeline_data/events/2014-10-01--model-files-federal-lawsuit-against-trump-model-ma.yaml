title: Model Files Federal Lawsuit Against Trump Model Management for Wage Theft
summary: 'Jamaican model Alexia Palmer files federal lawsuit against Trump Model Management
  seeking class-action status. Palmer''s H-1B visa application promised $75,000 per
  year, but she received only $3,880.75 over three years after agency fees. Court
  documents reveal systematic exploitation: models charged excessive fees, housed
  in overcrowded apartments, and prevented from working elsewhere due to ''power of
  attorney'' contracts giving Trump''s agency total control.'
