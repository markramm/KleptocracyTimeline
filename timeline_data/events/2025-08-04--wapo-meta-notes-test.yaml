title: Washington Post tests Meta's replacement for political fact-checking
summary: Washington Post columnist tested Meta's Community Notes with 65 draft notes, finding system 'failed to make a dent' in addressing falsehoods. Testing revealed 73% of political notes never display, 500-character limits, and no A/B testing versus fact-checkers before April 7 shutdown.

notes: 'Key gaps: No A/B testing vs fact-checkers, unclear political diversity methodology, 500-character limit, only evaluates headlines not full articles, US-only policy creates geographic gaps. March 18 public beta, April 7 fact-checker shutdown.'
