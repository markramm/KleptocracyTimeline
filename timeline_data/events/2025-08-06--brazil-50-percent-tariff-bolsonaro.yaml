notes: 'This represents a dangerous new precedent: using trade policy to punish countries
  for prosecuting corruption and coup attempts. Brazil''s prosecution of Bolsonaro
  follows legitimate legal processes for his role in the January 8, 2023 attack on
  government buildings (Brazil''s own January 6th). By imposing tariffs explicitly
  to protect Bolsonaro from prosecution, Trump signals that the US will use economic
  warfare to shield authoritarian allies from accountability. The $7.4 billion trade
  surplus makes this economically self-destructive, showing it''s purely about protecting
  corrupt leaders globally.'
