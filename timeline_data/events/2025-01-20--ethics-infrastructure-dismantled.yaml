title: Trump eliminates ethics requirements and lobbying restrictions
summary: Trump revoked Biden's Executive Order 13989 on ethics commitments on January
  20, 2025, eliminating requirements that banned gifts from lobbyists, prohibited
  shadow lobbying for one year, and imposed two-year cooling-off periods before joining
  firms that lobby agencies. The rescission allows former lobbyists and foreign agents
  to immediately join agencies they recently lobbied. Trump followed his first-term
  patternâ€”he imposed ethics rules in 2017 then revoked them on his last day in office.
  Public Citizen called the elimination of ethics safeguards "a very big deal," noting
  appointees can now effectively police themselves.
