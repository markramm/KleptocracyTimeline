  "title": "Banking Industry Launches Systematic Campaign to Erode Glass-Steagall Act",
  "summary": "Large commercial banks begin coordinated lobbying campaign against Glass-Steagall Act restrictions, claiming the Depression-era regulations render them less competitive against foreign securities firms. This systematic effort involves regulatory capture through administrative interpretations, academic influence campaigns to discredit Glass-Steagall's rationale, and legislative pressure for formal repeal. The campaign represents a fundamental shift from compliance with New Deal banking reforms toward aggressive circumvention and ultimate dismantling of financial safeguards separating commercial and investment banking.",
