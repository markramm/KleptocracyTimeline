title: Bush Administration Fires 9 U.S. Attorneys for Political Reasons
summary: The Bush administration fired 9 U.S. attorneys in an unprecedented midterm
  purge for what investigators determined were largely political reasons. Seven prosecutors
  were ordered to resign on December 7, 2006, including David Iglesias (New Mexico),
  Carol Lam (Southern California), and John McKay (Washington). Two others, Todd Graves
  and Bud Cummins, were dismissed earlier in 2006. Internal emails revealed Karl Rove
  and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales orchestrated the firings to replace prosecutors
  with 'loyal Bushies.' Iglesias faced pressure from Senator Pete Domenici and Rep.
  Heather Wilson to file Democratic indictments before the 2006 election. Carol Lam
  was targeted after successfully prosecuting Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham
  and notifying DOJ about planned CIA search warrants. The Justice Department Inspector
  General's 2008 report found the process was 'arbitrary' and 'fundamentally flawed,'
  with 'substantial evidence' that partisan political considerations drove several
  firings. Gonzales testified to Congress he couldn't recall events 71 times and resigned
  in disgrace on September 17, 2007.
