  "title": "Chicago Boys Initiate Radical Economic Shock Therapy Under Pinochet's Dictatorship",
  "summary": "In the aftermath of the 1973 Chilean coup, the Chicago Boys, a group of economists trained by Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, began implementing radical free-market economic reforms under Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Their 'shock therapy' approach involved rapid economic liberalization, including dramatic policy shifts: reducing customs duties from 94% to 10%, eliminating certain taxes, weakening labor unions, and privatizing public enterprises.\n\nKey Developments:\n- Implemented comprehensive economic transformation under authoritarian conditions\n- Reduced industrial production by 28% in 1975\n- Drove unemployment beyond 25%\n- Dramatically reduced state economic intervention\n\nImplications:\n- Demonstrated how psychological manipulation could drive systemic economic transformation\n- Created a model of economic restructuring through authoritarian control\n- Established precedent for neoliberal economic policy implementation",
