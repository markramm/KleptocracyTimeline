notes: Zeldin's plan to cut EPA by 65% while eliminating scientific research represents
  most aggressive environmental deregulation in agency history. His $186,000 in undisclosed
  paid op-eds defending polluters like JBS (major deforestation contributor) shows
  pattern of corporate advocacy. Terminating $20 billion in climate grants without
  evidence of fraud demonstrates arbitrary use of power. Eliminating scientific research
  arm ensures future policy decisions lack empirical basis, enabling unlimited pollution.
