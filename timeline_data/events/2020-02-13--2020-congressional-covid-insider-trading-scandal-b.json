  "title": "2020 Congressional COVID Insider Trading Scandal Begins",
  "summary": "Four U.S. senators came under investigation for potentially violating the STOCK Act by selling stock after receiving private briefings about the COVID-19 pandemic but before the market crash on February 20, 2020. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and his wife sold between 28,000 and .7 million worth of stock through 33 transactions on February 13. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and her husband sold stock worth between .3-3.1 million in 27 transactions following a private Senate Health Committee briefing on January 24. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) sold up to 00,000 in stock on January 27, and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sold .5-6 million in biotech stock between January 31 and February 18. The scandal highlighted how members of Congress continued to exploit non-public information for financial gain despite the 2012 STOCK Act, demonstrating the law's inadequacy in preventing congressional insider trading.",
