title: Supreme Court Allows Virginia to Purge 1,600 Voters Days Before Election Despite
  Federal Law
summary: U.S. Supreme Court allowed Virginia to purge over 1,600 voters within federally
  protected 90-day "quiet period" before 2024 election in 6-3 emergency decision,
  overturning lower court rulings in Beals v. Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights.
  Governor Glenn Youngkin's Executive Order 35, issued exactly 90 days before election,
  targeted naturalized citizens who previously held noncitizen identification numbers.
  Clear violation of National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) that prohibits systematic
  purges within 90 days of federal election. Decision enabled disenfranchisement of
  eligible citizens.

notes: Purge violated clear federal law protecting voters from systematic removal
  within 90 days of election. Targeted naturalized citizens based on outdated DMV
  records. Set dangerous precedent for ignoring NVRA protections.
