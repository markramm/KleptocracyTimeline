description: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly received $80,000 from
  dark money fund - a 10% cut of funds she raised - which she failed to disclose on
  federal ethics forms. Previously used governor's office to intervene in daughter's
  denied real estate appraiser license and used state funds for personal trips. Pattern
  of monetizing public office continues at DHS overseeing $90 billion budget.

notes: Noem's secret $80,000 dark money payments reveal pattern of treating public
  office as personal ATM. Taking 10% cut of funds raised echoes mob protection rackets.
  Previous abuse includes forcing state officials to approve daughter's denied appraiser
  license and using state plane for personal trips. Failure to disclose on federal
  forms suggests consciousness of guilt. Now oversees $90 billion DHS budget with
  massive contracting opportunities for enrichment.
