title: Trump Proposes Hosting G-7 Summit at His Doral Golf Resort
summary: |
  President Trump proposed hosting the 2020 G-7 summit at his Trump National Doral 
  golf resort in Miami, which would have directed millions in government spending 
  to his struggling property. Trump claimed Doral was "by far the best physical 
  facility" and offered to host "at cost," but the proposal would have required 
  foreign governments to pay Trump's business directly. After bipartisan backlash 
  and accusations of constitutional violations, Trump reversed course on October 19, 
  2019. Financial disclosures showed Doral's revenue had declined 69% since 2015.

notes: |
  This represented one of the most brazen attempts at self-dealing, as Trump tried 
  to use the presidency to direct government contracts to his failing business. 
  The Doral resort had seen massive revenue declines since Trump took office, and 
  hosting G-7 would have provided a significant financial boost. The reversal only 
  came after Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the plan, showing even 
  Trump's allies recognized the constitutional violation was too obvious to defend.
