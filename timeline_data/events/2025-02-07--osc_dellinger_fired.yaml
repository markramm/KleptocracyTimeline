title: President fires Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger; litigation ensues
date: '2025-02-07'
summary: President Trump fired Hampton Dellinger from his position as head of the Office
  of Special Counsel via email on Friday night, February 7, 2025, stating simply "your
  position...is terminated, effective immediately." Dellinger immediately sued, arguing
  his removal violated statutory for-cause protections requiring "inefficiency, neglect
  of duty, or malfeasance." Judge Amy Berman Jackson initially ordered Dellinger reinstated
  while the case proceeded. The OSC investigates whistleblower retaliation and Hatch Act
  violations.

notes: Dellinger was confirmed by the Senate in 2024 for a 5-year term. His firing was
  part of Trump's broader purge of watchdogs, including 15 inspectors general fired
  5 days after inauguration. Dellinger eventually dropped his lawsuit in March 2025
  after an appeals court allowed his removal while the case proceeded.
