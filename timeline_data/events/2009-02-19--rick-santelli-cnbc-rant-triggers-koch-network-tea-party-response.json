  "title": "Rick Santelli CNBC Rant Triggers Immediate Koch Network Tea Party Response",
  "summary": "CNBC reporter Rick Santelli delivers his \"Rant Heard Round the World\" from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor, criticizing Obama's mortgage bailout plan and calling for a \"Chicago Tea Party.\" Within hours, Americans for Prosperity registers the domain TaxDayTeaParty.com and launches a website calling for protests. Other conservative organizations quickly follow: reTeaParty.com is registered within 10 hours, ChicagoTeaParty.com goes live within 12 hours, and FreedomWorks's Eric Odom helps create a Facebook page by February 20th. The next day, 50 national conservative leaders participate in a conference call that formalizes the national Tea Party movement. This immediate, coordinated response demonstrates the pre-existing organizational infrastructure the Koch network had built to capitalize on populist moments.",
