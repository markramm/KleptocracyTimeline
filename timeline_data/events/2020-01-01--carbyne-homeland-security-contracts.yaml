title: Epstein-funded Carbyne receives $1.5M in U.S. Homeland Security contracts
summary: Carbyne, the surveillance technology company co-founded by former Unit 8200
  chief and funded by Jeffrey Epstein and Ehud Barak, received $1.5 million in U.S.
  Department of Homeland Security contracts. The contracts were for "electromagnetic
  imaging and artificial intelligence to detect threats," effectively integrating
  Israeli military intelligence technology into U.S. national security infrastructure.
  This represents foreign surveillance capabilities being embedded into American emergency
  response systems with complete access to callers' cameras and GPS data.
