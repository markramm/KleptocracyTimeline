  "title": "Powell Expands Corporate Speech Rights in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy Decision",
  "summary": "Justice Powell authors the majority opinion in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, establishing First Amendment protection for commercial speech by striking down state restrictions on prescription drug price advertising. This decision begins Powell's systematic expansion of corporate speech rights through constitutional interpretation, implementing his 1971 memo's vision of using courts as instruments for corporate political change. The ruling creates precedent for corporate entities to claim First Amendment protections previously reserved for individuals.",
