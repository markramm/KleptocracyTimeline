  "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is arrested in Manhattan on federal charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. The indictment alleges Combs ran a criminal enterprise that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors describe an operation remarkably similar to Jeffrey Epstein's, including the use of recordings for blackmail, control of victims through violence and coercion, and a network of enablers who helped conceal crimes.",
