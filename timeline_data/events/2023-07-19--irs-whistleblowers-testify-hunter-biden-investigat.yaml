title: IRS Whistleblowers Testify Hunter Biden Investigation Was Obstructed by DOJ
summary: IRS supervisory agent Gary Shapley and case agent Joseph Ziegler testified
  before House Oversight Committee that the Justice Department investigation into
  Hunter Biden was 'slow walked' with political interference. They alleged prosecutors
  blocked scrutiny of Joe Biden's potential involvement, tipped off Hunter Biden's
  attorneys about evidence searches, and that U.S. Attorney David Weiss said he was
  'not the deciding person' on charges despite public statements. Ziegler, a Democrat
  who didn't vote in 2020, recommended multiple felony charges in 2021 that weren't
  pursued. Both agents claimed retaliation after their disclosures. Other witnesses
  disputed some key allegations but confirmed frustration with the probe's pace and
  venue-shopping for charges.
