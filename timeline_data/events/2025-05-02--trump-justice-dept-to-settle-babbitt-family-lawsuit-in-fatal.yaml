title: Trump Justice Dept. to settle Babbitt family lawsuit in fatal Jan. 6 shooting
summary: The DOJ has reversed its previous decision and agreed to settle a $30 million
  wrongful death claim brought by the family of Ashli Babbit–the January 6 rioter
  who was shot by Capitol police as she attempted to break into the House Chamber.
  The move signals to right wing militia members that not only will Trump protect
  you from legal prosecution, you (or your family) may also get a huge payday for
  doing the president's bidding
