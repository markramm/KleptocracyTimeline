  "title": "Coordinated Federal Workforce Purge: Schedule F and DOJ Personnel Removal",
  "summary": "Trump administration implements unprecedented Schedule F (renamed Schedule Policy/Career) executive order on first day of presidency, systematically dismantling civil service protections and targeting DOJ prosecution staff. The order reclassifies an estimated 50,000 federal workers (2% of federal workforce), effectively politicizing key policy positions and allowing immediate termination of career employees.\n\nSpecific actions include firing DOJ prosecutors Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Anne McNamara, and Mary Dohrmann, while demanding comprehensive lists of federal employees for potential reclassification or removal. The order creates a new category that strips civil service protections from employees with 'policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential duties'.\n\nKey Implications:\n- Enables mass removal of career civil servants perceived as 'disloyal'\n- Transforms nonpartisan civil service into politically malleable positions\n- Undermines constitutional principles of public service\n- Part of Project 2025's systematic institutional capture strategy\n\nLegal and Labor Responses:\n- National Treasury Employees Union filed immediate lawsuit\n- American Federation of Government Employees condemned the rule\n- Lawmakers reintroduced the Saving the Civil Service Act to block reclassification",
