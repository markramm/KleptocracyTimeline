  "title": "Heritage Foundation's \"Mandate for Leadership\" Becomes Reagan Administration Blueprint",
  "summary": "The Heritage Foundation publishes \"Mandate for Leadership,\" a comprehensive 3,000-page policy blueprint containing over 2,000 specific recommendations for conservative governance, which becomes the operational manual for the Reagan administration. Reagan distributes copies to every Cabinet member at their first meeting and the administration implements nearly two-thirds of Heritage's recommendations, demonstrating the unprecedented influence of think tank policy development on actual governance. The document represents the culmination of the Powell Memorandum's vision for conservative intellectual infrastructure directly shaping government policy. Heritage contributors including James Watt and Norman Ture receive major appointments in the Reagan administration, while the foundation's tax cut proposals become central to Reagan's economic program. This milestone establishes the model for think tank-to-government policy pipeline that becomes standard practice, showing how corporate-funded research institutions can effectively capture regulatory and policy-making processes through detailed policy prescriptions and personnel placement.",
