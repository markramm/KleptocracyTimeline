  "title": "Barre Seid Donates $1.6 Billion to Leonard Leo Dark Money Network",
  "summary": "Chicago businessman Barre Seid provided an unprecedented $1.6 billion donation to Leonard Leo's Marble Freedom Trust through a strategic stock transfer of Tripp Lite to Eaton Corporation. This donation, the largest known to a political advocacy group in U.S. history, potentially avoided approximately $400 million in taxes. By transferring 100% ownership of his electronics manufacturing company before its sale, Seid strategically channeled funds to a conservative network aimed at reshaping American judicial and political institutions. The donation significantly empowers Leonard Leo's efforts to influence conservative legal and political networks, representing a landmark moment in dark money political financing.",
