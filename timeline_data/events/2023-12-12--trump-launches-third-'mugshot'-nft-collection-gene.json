  "summary": "Trump launched his third NFT collection titled 'MugShot' featuring 100,000 digital trading cards based on his Georgia election interference mugshot, priced at $99 each. The collection generated approximately $9.9 million in initial revenue and offered pieces of Trump's actual mugshot suit to buyers purchasing 47 cards. The launch caused his previous NFT collection prices to drop nearly 50% initially, demonstrating potential market cannibalization and the volatile nature of Trump's digital asset strategy.",
