  "date": "2024-07-13",
  "description": "Following Trump's assassination attempt and Musk's subsequent endorsement on July 13, 2024, research by Timothy Graham and Mark Andrejevic revealed systematic algorithmic changes on X that boosted Musk's post views by 138.27% (approximately 6.4 million additional views from a baseline of 4.43 million). The study found evidence of potential algorithmic bias favoring Republican content, with Republican accounts gaining an additional 952,300 views post-endorsement.",
