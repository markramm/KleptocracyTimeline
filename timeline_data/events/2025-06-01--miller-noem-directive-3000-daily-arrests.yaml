title: Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem directive demands 3,000 daily ICE arrests
summary: Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi
  Noem issued a directive to ICE to arrest up to 3,000 immigrants each day - a more
  than fourfold increase from the previous daily average. This unprecedented quota

  toward quantity over targeted enforcement.
