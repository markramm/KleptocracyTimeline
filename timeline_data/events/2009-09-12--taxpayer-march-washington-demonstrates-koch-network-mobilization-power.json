  "title": "9/12 Taxpayer March on Washington Demonstrates Koch Network Mobilization Power",
  "summary": "The Taxpayer March on Washington (9/12 Tea Party) brings an estimated 60,000-70,000 protesters to Washington D.C., representing one of the largest early Tea Party demonstrations. Organized primarily by FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity - the Koch brothers' organizational successors to Citizens for a Sound Economy - the event demonstrates the mobilization power of well-funded astroturf operations. FreedomWorks began planning the march in March 2009 and offered intensive two-day grassroots training sessions that attracted over 2,000 local activists. While presented as a spontaneous citizen uprising, the event exemplifies sophisticated corporate-funded political theater designed to simulate grassroots opposition to policies unfavorable to billionaire donors.",
