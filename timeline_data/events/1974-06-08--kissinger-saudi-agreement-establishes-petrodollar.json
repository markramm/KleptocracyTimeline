  "title": "Kissinger-Saudi Agreement Establishes Petrodollar Recycling Through Chase Manhattan and Wall Street Banks",
  "summary": "Secretary of State Henry Kissinger concludes negotiations with Saudi Arabia establishing the petrodollar system that will channel oil revenues through American financial institutions, particularly Chase Manhattan Bank and other Wall Street firms controlled by Trilateral Commission members. The agreement requires Saudi Arabia to price all oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars and invest surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury securities and Wall Street banks, creating artificial demand for dollars that props up American financial hegemony despite the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. David Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank emerges as a primary beneficiary, becoming a leading intermediary for petrodollar recycling and generating enormous profits from managing oil surplus investments. Kissinger coins the term \"petrodollar recycling\" and strongly suggests to King Faisal that Saudi Arabia invest oil surpluses in U.S. government debt, effectively making American banks and the U.S. Treasury the primary beneficiaries of oil price increases. The system creates a circular flow where oil price increases benefit both OPEC producers and American financial institutions, while oil-consuming nations become increasingly indebted to Wall Street banks. By 1975, all OPEC members agree to similar arrangements, generating 50 billion in surplus revenues between 1974-1981 that flow through American and European banks. This represents a masterful example of financial engineering by international banking elites, converting a potential economic crisis into a mechanism for expanding their control over global capital flows and maintaining dollar dominance in international finance.",
