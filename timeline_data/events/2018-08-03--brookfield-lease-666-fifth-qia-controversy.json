Senate Finance letters later pressed Brookfield on whether Qatar‑linked\nfunds indirectly backed the deal.\n",
  "notes": "Present both: (1) Brookfield's official announcement and denials of QIA involvement; (2) Reuters\nand Senate Finance materials highlighting QIA's investment ties to Brookfield Property Partners\nand seeking answers about the financing chain.\n",
