  "title": "Robert Rubin Goldman Sachs Treasury Secretary Appointment",
  "summary": "Robert Rubin, former Goldman Sachs co-chairman and 26-year veteran, appointed as 70th Treasury Secretary under Clinton administration. Immediate conflicts of interest arise regarding Mexico peso crisis bailout, where Goldman Sachs had underwritten more Mexican debt ($5.1 billion) than any other Wall Street firm. Republican congressmen accuse Rubin of unethical conduct, noting his $26 million annual compensation from Mexican clients and potential continuing financial interest in Goldman Sachs that could benefit from the bailout. Representative Ernest Istook demands recusal, while Spencer Bachus announces House Banking Committee investigations.",
