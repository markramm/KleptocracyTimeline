  "notes": "The purchase occurred several months before 9/11. In 2008, Saudi Arabia converted the apartments into part of their UN Mission. During Trump's presidency, the Saudi government paid over $537,080 in building charges and fees, raising emoluments clause concerns as these foreign government payments were made without Congressional approval. The State Department authorized the rental arrangement without the constitutionally required Congressional consent. This was part of at least $7.8 million Trump received from 20 foreign governments while president."
