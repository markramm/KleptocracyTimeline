notes: Bondi initially ordered DC to accept DEA boss Terry Cole as "emergency police
  commissioner" with full control, requiring MPD approval for all directives. Federal
  Judge Ana Reyes threatened restraining order, forcing DOJ to negotiate. Cole now
  serves as Bondi's "designee" rather than replacement chief. Represents attempted
  federal seizure of local law enforcement using emergency powers.
