title: Jack Smith releases final report concluding Trump would have been convicted
  for January 6 crimes
summary: Special Counsel Jack Smith released his 137-page final report on Trump's
  January 6 case, concluding Trump engaged in an "unprecedented criminal effort" to
  overturn the 2020 election through "deceit and knowingly false claims." Smith stated
  Trump would have been convicted at trial "but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent
  return to the Presidency." The report revealed Trump knew he lost, telling Pence
  he was "too honest" and fake electors testified they wouldn't have participated
  had they known the full plan.
