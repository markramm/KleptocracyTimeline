title: House Oversight Subcommittee Votes 8-2 to Subpoena DOJ for Epstein Files
summary: The House Oversight subcommittee voted 8-2 to subpoena the DOJ for Epstein
  files on July 23, 2025, with three Republicans—Nancy Mace (R-SC), Scott Perry (R-PA),
  and Brian Jack (R-GA)—breaking ranks to join Democrats in demanding transparency.
  This bipartisan rebellion followed the DOJ's July 7 memo claiming no client list exists
  and marked unprecedented congressional pushback against Trump's reversal on his campaign
  promise of "100% transparency" on Epstein files.

notes: The bipartisan vote demonstrated how Trump's reversal on Epstein transparency
  fractured his own party's support. This followed Musk's explosive claims and public
  pressure campaign that split the MAGA movement on the issue.
