notes: Bradley Bondi (runs Paul Hastings global white collar defense) represented
  Elon Musk & Trump Media. Called result "disgusting" and "hijacked" by "rabid partisans."
  Seltzer endorsed by 24 former DC Bar presidents. Record 43% turnout (38,600 of 90,000
  members) vs 9% (7,570) in 2024. Previous record was 1990. Fears of bar politicization/weaponization
  drove massive turnout.
