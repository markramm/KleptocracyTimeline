importance: 5
summary: On April 15, 2025, days after a federal court ordered the White House to
  restore Associated Press access, the Trump administration restructured the presidential
  press pool and eliminated the permanent wire-service position. This unprecedented
  move wrested control of press pool composition from the White House Correspondents'
  Association (WHCA), allowing the administration to hand-pick which journalists cover
  the president. WHCA and press freedom groups condemned this as an attack on independent
  journalism.

notes: This restructuring came immediately after losing a court case over AP access,
  demonstrating the administration's determination to control media coverage despite
  judicial orders. First time in modern history the White House seized control of
  press pool composition from journalists.
