  "title": "Federal Reserve Approves JP Morgan Corporate Stock Underwriting",
  "summary": "The Federal Reserve Board approves JP Morgan & Co. to underwrite corporate stock, completing the reunification of commercial and investment banking activities that Glass-Steagall had separated since 1933. With both the commercial (JP Morgan & Co.) and investment (Morgan Stanley) arms of the original House of Morgan now competing in securities markets, the Fed has effectively recreated the pre-1933 financial structure that Glass-Steagall was designed to prevent. This approval demonstrates complete regulatory capture, as the Fed systematically authorizes activities explicitly prohibited by congressional legislation.",
