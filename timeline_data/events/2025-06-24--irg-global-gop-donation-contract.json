  "summary": "IRG Global Emergency Management donated $10,000 to the Florida GOP on June 24, 2025, and received a $1.1 million Alligator Alcatraz contract hours later. Within a week, the company secured two additional contracts totaling $5.1 million for shuttle transportation, emergency services, and air operations. IRG, formed in February 2025, is an offshoot of Access Restoration Services (ARS), which previously donated $250,000 to DeSantis PACs and holds $108 million in state contracts. The contracts bypassed competitive bidding using emergency powers, with IRG ultimately receiving $20.8 million total despite being a new company.",
