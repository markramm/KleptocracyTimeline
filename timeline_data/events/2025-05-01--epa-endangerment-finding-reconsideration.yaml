title: EPA reconsiders 2009 Endangerment Finding underlying all climate regulations
summary: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced formal reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment
  Finding on July 29, calling repeal "largest deregulatory action in history of America."
  Finding declared CO2 and 5 other GHGs endanger public health. Repeal would eliminate
  legal basis for all climate rules on power plants, vehicles, oil/gas industry. Would
  save $54B annually per Zeldin. Public hearings Aug 19-21, comments through Sept
  15. Trump EO on Day 1 questioned "legality and continuing applicability."

notes: Would eliminate scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases. EPA argues
  Obama admin "overstepped legal authority," cites recent SCOTUS decisions. Uses DOE
  "Climate Work Group" study by 5 climate contrarians. Sierra Club exploring litigation.
  Critics say lacks scientific and legal foundation. 2007 Mass v EPA required EPA
  to determine if GHGs endanger health.
