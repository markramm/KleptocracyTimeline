title: Trump administration defies court orders in 57 of 165 cases (35%)
summary: According to Washington Post analysis, the Trump administration has been
  accused of flouting courts in about a third of more than 160 lawsuits where judges
  issued substantive rulings against them. CNN reports the administration is "at war
  with the federal judiciary," evading court orders blocking its agenda and suing
  judges for alleged misconduct, with multiple federal judges warning this could precipitate
  a constitutional crisis.
