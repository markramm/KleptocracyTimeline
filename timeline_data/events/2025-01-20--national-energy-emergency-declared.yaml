title: National Energy Emergency Declared via Executive Order
date: 2025-01-20
importance: 6
summary: Trump declared a national energy emergency on January 20, 2025, stating "We
  will drill, baby, drill" during inauguration. The order enables emergency permitting
  procedures, expedites fossil fuel infrastructure, and directs rescinding 2021-2025
  environmental regulations. A companion order "Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary
  Resource Potential" reopens Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and National Petroleum
  Reserve for drilling, removes Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea restrictions, and increases
  logging and mining on federal lands. The U.S. is already a net fossil fuel exporter
  with no shortage, making the emergency declaration legally questionable.

notes: Executive authority expansion through emergency declarations to bypass statutes
  despite no actual energy shortage. U.S. produces more oil and gas than any other
  country. Critics note emergency powers being used for political goals rather than
  actual emergencies.
