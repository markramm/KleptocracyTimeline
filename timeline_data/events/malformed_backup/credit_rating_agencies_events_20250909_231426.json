    "title": "SEC Creates NRSRO Designation, Cementing Credit Rating Agencies Regulatory Oligopoly",
    "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission formally created the \"Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization\" (NRSRO) designation, granting official regulatory status to just three credit rating agencies: Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch. This designation was ostensibly designed to ensure credible bond ratings for broker-dealer capital requirements under Rule 15c3-1, but instead created a regulatory cartel that would prove catastrophic decades later. The SEC worried about \"bogus\" rating firms promising AAA ratings for payment, yet ironically institutionalized the same conflict through regulatory capture. By limiting NRSRO status to these three agencies, the SEC created insurmountable barriers to entry and gave the established firms quasi-governmental authority over financial markets. This regulatory framework coincided with the agencies' transition from the traditional \"investor pays\" model established by John Moody in 1909 to the fundamentally conflicted \"issuer pays\" model, where bond issuers directly compensate the agencies rating their securities. The 1975 designation effectively granted these private companies a license to operate as financial market gatekeepers with minimal oversight, setting the stage for the systematic ratings fraud that would enable the 2008 financial crisis.",

    "title": "Credit Rating Agencies Expand Workforce to Rate Massive Subprime Mortgage Securities",
    "summary": "By 2000, the transformation of credit rating agencies under the \"issuer pays\" model had fundamentally altered their operations and incentives. Standard & Poor's employed 800 analysts and Moody's employed 560, a massive expansion from the \"handful\" of analysts they had employed under the traditional investor-pays model. This workforce expansion was driven by the explosive growth in structured financial products, particularly mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. The agencies were now earning enormous fees from Wall Street banks for rating increasingly complex and risky financial instruments. From 2000 to 2007, the agencies would rate nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities, with over half receiving AAA ratings. The period marked the beginning of systematic ratings inflation, where agencies competed for business by providing more favorable ratings than their competitors. Internal communications later revealed that agencies were aware they were compromising their standards to maintain market share. The workforce expansion represented the industrialization of what had been a careful, methodical process of credit evaluation into a high-volume, fee-driven operation that prioritized speed and client satisfaction over accuracy and integrity.",

    "title": "Credit Agencies Award AAA Ratings to 69 Billion in Toxic Mortgage Securities",
    "summary": "During 2006, at the height of the housing bubble, Moody's alone rated 69 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities as AAA - the same rating given to U.S. Treasury bonds and only six private sector companies in America. This represented the peak of systematic ratings fraud, where agencies knowingly assigned their highest safety ratings to securities backed by subprime mortgages with documented patterns of borrower fraud and predatory lending. The agencies were generating unprecedented revenues from these ratings, with structured finance becoming their most profitable business line. Internal documents later revealed that agencies modified their models to produce higher ratings and maintain market share, with executives pressuring analysts to deliver ratings that would satisfy investment bank clients. Gary Witt, former Moody's team managing director, later testified that investment banks \"would threaten you all of the time\" to withdraw business if they didn't receive desired ratings. The 69 billion in 2006 AAA-rated mortgage securities would prove catastrophically mispriced - by April 2010, 73% had been downgraded to junk status. This single year represented the climax of regulatory capture, where agencies prioritized fee generation over their fundamental public responsibility to provide accurate risk assessment.",

    "title": "Housing Price Collapse Exposes Credit Rating Agencies Massive Fraud",
    "summary": "As housing prices began their dramatic collapse in 2007, the systematic fraud perpetrated by credit rating agencies became undeniably apparent. Moody's was forced to downgrade 83% of the 69 billion in mortgage securities it had rated AAA just the year before, representing one of the largest acknowledgments of analytical failure in financial history. The downgrades revealed that the agencies had not merely been overly optimistic, but had systematically ignored fundamental risks in pursuit of fee revenue. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission later concluded that the agencies' \"failures\" were \"essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction\" and \"key enablers of the financial meltdown.\" Internal documents released during congressional investigations showed that rating agencies had been aware of deteriorating mortgage quality but continued assigning inflated ratings to maintain their lucrative structured finance business. The collapse exposed how regulatory capture had created a system where private companies with conflicts of interest held quasi-governmental authority over financial markets without meaningful oversight. The agencies had rated over three trillion dollars of loans to homebuyers with bad credit and undocumented incomes, treating them as equivalent to the safest investments available.",
