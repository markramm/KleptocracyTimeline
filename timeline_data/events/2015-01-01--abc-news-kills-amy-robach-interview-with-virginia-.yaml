summary: ABC News anchor Amy Robach conducts explosive interview with Virginia Giuffre
  detailing Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking network and powerful clients including Prince
  Andrew. ABC executives kill the story, claiming insufficient corroboration. The

  that the network 'had it all' but refused to air it.
