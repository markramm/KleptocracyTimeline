  "summary": "The White House Iraq Group coordinated a synchronized media blitz for September 8, 2002, with administration officials booked on all five major Sunday news programs to deliver identical talking points about Iraq's alleged nuclear weapons program. Vice President Cheney appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, National Security Advisor Rice on CNN's Late Edition, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on CBS's Face the Nation, General Myers on ABC's This Week, and Deputy Secretary Armitage on Fox News Sunday. Each official used nearly identical language about aluminum tubes and the 'mushroom cloud' threat, demonstrating unprecedented message coordination. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card later admitted the timing was deliberate: 'From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August.' This coordinated propaganda campaign exploited the public's trust in independent journalism.",
