  "date": "2007-05-10",
  "description": "Purdue Frederick Company Inc. (Purdue Pharma affiliate) and three top executives plead guilty to criminal charges of misbranding OxyContin by falsely claiming it was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other opioids. The company pays $634 million in fines while executives Michael Friedman, Howard R. Udell, and Paul D. Goldenheim pay $34.5 million in personal fines. Despite making $2.8 billion in revenue from OxyContin from 1996-2001, evidence shows Purdue trained sales representatives to falsely tell doctors that addiction risk was 'less than one percent' and continued deceptive practices even after this plea agreement. This represents one of the largest pharmaceutical fraud settlements at the time, yet failed to adequately deter the company's ongoing deceptive marketing practices.",
