title: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao Used Office to Benefit Family Shipping Business
summary: |
  Inspector General report revealed Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao repeatedly 
  used her office and staff to benefit her family's shipping business, Foremost Group, 
  which has extensive ties to China. Chao directed staff to help with father's travel, 
  edit his Wikipedia page, send his books to Chinese officials, and promote the family 
  business. She planned official trip to China including family members and meetings 
  beneficial to Foremost Group before ethics officials raised concerns. Her husband, 
  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, received millions in gifts from her father. 
  DOJ declined to prosecute despite IG criminal referral.

notes: |
  The Chao-McConnell corruption demonstrated how Cabinet members used their positions 
  to benefit family businesses with foreign ties. Foremost Group received hundreds of 
  millions in Chinese state bank loans while Chao shaped U.S. shipping policy. The 
  DOJ's refusal to prosecute despite criminal referral showed how corruption was 
  normalized in the Trump administration. This case uniquely involved both executive 
  and legislative branch leaders profiting from Chinese business relationships while 
  shaping U.S.-China policy.
