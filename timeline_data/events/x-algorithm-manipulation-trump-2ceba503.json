  "date": "2024-07-13",
  "location": "Austin, TX, United States",
  "category": "information-warfare",
  "importance": 9,
  "summary": "Comprehensive research by Queensland University of Technology and Monash University revealed systematic algorithmic manipulation on X platform, demonstrating a deliberate transformation of social media infrastructure for political influence operations. A rigorous two-phase computational study using CUSUM statistical methods and Difference-in-Differences approach found a significant 'change point' on July 13, 2024 - the day Musk endorsed Trump - showing dramatic increases in engagement metrics.\n\nKey findings include:\n- 138.27% increase in views for Musk's account post-endorsement\n- Approximately 6.4 million additional views for Musk\n- Republican-leaning accounts gained 952,300 additional views\n- By October 2024, 'For You' section contained twice as much pro-Trump content compared to pro-Harris content\n\nThe research provided quantitative evidence of platform manipulation, transforming social media algorithms from neutral engagement optimization to targeted political warfare tools. Researchers Timothy Graham and Mark Andrejevic highlighted the potential for oligarch-controlled infrastructure to directly manipulate information exposure for millions of global users.",
