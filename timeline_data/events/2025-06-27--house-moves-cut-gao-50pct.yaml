importance: 6
summary: House Appropriations Committee advanced a Legislative Branch bill on June 27, 2025, proposing to cut the Government Accountability Office (GAO) budget by nearly 50% and limiting its ability to enforce impoundment laws. The cuts would cripple Congress's primary watchdog agency responsible for investigating government waste and illegal spending. Senate appropriators later rejected these cuts, recognizing GAO's critical oversight role.

notes: This attempt to gut GAO came after it challenged Trump administration impoundments. GAO is Congress's nonpartisan watchdog that investigates federal spending and has repeatedly found illegal withholding of congressionally appropriated funds.
