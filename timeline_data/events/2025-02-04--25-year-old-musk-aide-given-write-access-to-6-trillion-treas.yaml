title: 25-Year-Old Musk Aide Given Write Access to $6 Trillion Treasury Payment System
summary: Marko Elez, a 25-year-old engineer linked to Elon Musk, was granted administrative
  privileges including ability to write code for Treasury Department's Payment Automation
  Manager (PAM) and Secure Payments System (SPS) that handle $6 trillion annually
  in Social Security, Medicare, and government contractor payments. Career official
  David Lebryk was placed on leave after resisting the access grant.
description: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel unprecedented
  access to critical payment systems. Elez had full administrative privileges to modify
  code in systems handling all federal payments. After racist posts were discovered
  on his social media, Elez resigned, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with
  backing from Trump and VP Vance. The Treasury IG launched an audit of security controls
  after Democratic lawmakers raised alarms about the access.
