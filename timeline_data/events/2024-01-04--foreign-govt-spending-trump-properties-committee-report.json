  "summary": "A staff report by House Oversight Committee Democrats, based on Mazars-produced records for\nlimited years and entities, found that Trump businesses received at least $7.8 million from 20\nforeign governments while he was presidentâ€”likely an undercount. Watchdogs report higher\nestimates when aggregating additional sources, while Trump publicly asserted the payments\nwere for ordinary services.\n",
  "notes": "Show both: (1) the official congressional minority report and executive summary; (2) independent\nwatchdog tallies (CREW). Note that the committee had incomplete records after production was\ncurtailed, so figures are minimums, not totals.\n",
