title: Apple Receives Special Tariff Exemptions After CEO Cultivates Trump Relationship
summary: Despite Trump's public claims that Apple would get "no Tariff relief" for
  China-made products, Apple's flagship goods including iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks
  were ultimately spared from tariffs. The administration quietly granted Apple specific
  exclusions after CEO Tim Cook personally appealed to Trump over dinner. Critics
  said tariff policy was bent to favor a "Trump sycophant" in Cook.
