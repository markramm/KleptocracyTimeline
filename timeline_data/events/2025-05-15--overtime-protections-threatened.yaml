title: 4.3 million workers could lose overtime protections
summary: Trump administration moves to revert to weak Trump-era overtime threshold
  ($35,568) from Biden's $58,656 rule, stripping overtime protections from 4.3 million
  workers per Economic Policy Institute. Project 2025 also proposes calculating overtime
  over 2-4 week periods instead of weekly, and substituting comp time for time-and-a-half
  pay, further eroding worker protections.

notes: EPI calculated 4.3M workers lose protections reverting from Biden's $58,656
  threshold (effective Jan 2025) to Trump's $35,568. Project 2025 proposes allowing
  overtime calculation over 80 hours/2 weeks or 160 hours/4 weeks instead of 40 hours/week,
  and letting employers substitute comp time for overtime pay. Changes can happen
  without Congressional approval.
