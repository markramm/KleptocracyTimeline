notes: 'GENIUS requires stablecoin issuers hold liquid asset reserves, grant coin holders
  bankruptcy priority. Subjects issuers to AML/sanctions compliance. No direct tax changes -
  IRS still treats crypto as property (Notice 2014-21). House also passed Digital Asset Market
  Clarity Act (SEC/CFTC roles) and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Trump fulfilled campaign
  promise to make US "crypto capital of the world." Bill legitimizes $3T crypto industry.'
