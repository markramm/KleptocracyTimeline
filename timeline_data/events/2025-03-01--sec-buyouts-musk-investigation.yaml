title: SEC offers $50,000 buyouts to staff investigating Elon Musk
summary: SEC offered $50,000 buyouts to staff members while they were investigating
  Elon Musk, creating pressure to leave during active enforcement actions against
  the DOGE co-director's companies. Lead attorney Robin Andrews resigned April 2025,
  calling it "heartbreaking" amid concerns Trump-appointed SEC chair would dismiss
  case or settle for small penalty. Another attorney Bernard Smyth also left. SEC
  sued Musk January 14, 2025 for Twitter acquisition violations alleging he underpaid
  by $150+ million through improper disclosure delays.
