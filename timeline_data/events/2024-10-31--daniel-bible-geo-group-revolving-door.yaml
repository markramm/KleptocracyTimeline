title: ICE detention chief Daniel Bible joins GEO Group days before election
summary: Daniel Bible, ICE's top career official in charge of detaining undocumented immigrants for nearly 15 years, left the agency on October 31, 2024, to become executive vice president at GEO Group, ICE's largest private detention contractor. Bible joins at least six other former ICE officials who moved to GEO Group over the past decade. GEO Group had previously paid $1,025 for Bible's travel and lunch for an "employment discussion." The company and its affiliates contributed over $1 million to Trump-aligned PACs in 2024.
