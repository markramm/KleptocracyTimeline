  "summary": "Dr. Stephen Hahn, former FDA Commissioner who led the agency during COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations, joined Flagship Pioneering as Chief Medical Officer on June 16, 2021. The move came six months after the FDA granted emergency use authorization to Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. Flagship Pioneering is the venture capital firm that launched Moderna and holds significant financial stakes in the company. This transition exemplifies the 'revolving door' phenomenon in pharmaceutical regulation, raising systemic concerns about potential conflicts of interest between government regulators and the pharmaceutical industry.",
