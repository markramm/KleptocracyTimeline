    "summary": "On February 16, 1973, Joseph Coors, Ed Feulner, and Paul Weyrich establish the Heritage Foundation with $250,000 in initial funding. Inspired by the Powell Memorandum's strategy, the think tank represents a key institutional implementation of corporate influence through policy research. Founders saw a critical need to develop conservative policy ideas and provide legislative support, bridging the gap between conservative principles and policy implementation. Coors financial backing, combined with Feulner and Weyrich political expertise, created a blueprint for conservative policy development that would significantly shape American political discourse.",
