Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers explicitly studied and acknowledged the Confederacy's political innovations, which directly influenced constitutional design principles.\n\nScholarly research highlights specific democratic features predating European models: separation of military and civil leadership, protection of individual freedoms including religious liberty, democratic processes like referendums and recalls, and meaningful political participation for women.\n\n## Sources\n\n1.
