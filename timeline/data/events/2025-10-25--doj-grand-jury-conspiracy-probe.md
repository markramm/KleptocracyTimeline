title: Federal Grand Jury Convened to Investigate 'Conspiracy Against Trump'
---

Conservative lawyer Mike Davis announced a federal grand jury in Florida will convene in January to investigate an alleged decade-long 'conspiracy' against Trump involving Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, Chris Wray, and Jack Smith. Court filings confirm the grand jury's existence, though its mandate remains secret. The investigation represents the weaponization of the grand jury system to pursue political vendettas rather than legitimate criminal matters, converting federal prosecutorial power into a tool for retribution against those who held Trump accountable. Attorney General Pam Bondi's involvement in authorizing the investigation demonstrates complete DOJ capture, with Trump's former personal attorney directing prosecutions of his political enemies. The grand jury transforms lawful law enforcement actions—investigating Trump's conduct—into alleged criminal conspiracies, inverting accountability to punish investigators rather than wrongdoers.
