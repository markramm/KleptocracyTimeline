JD Vance is inaugurated as the 50th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 2025, sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in an indoor ceremony at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. At 40 years old, Vance becomes the third-youngest VP in history, the first Millennial generation VP, and the first Marine Corps veteran to hold the office.

Key Developments:
- Sworn in by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with whom his wife Usha previously clerked
- Used his great-grandmother's family Bible during the oath
- Placed first in presidential succession under the 25th Amendment
- Potential constitutional authority to invoke Section 4 with Cabinet support

Historical Context:
- Second Catholic vice president after Joe Biden
- Represents generational shift in political leadership
- Potential constitutional crisis management role
