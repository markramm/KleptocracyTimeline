SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell announced a major transaction with EchoStar on September 8, 2025, where SpaceX agreed to acquire 50 MHz of wireless spectrum and mobile satellite service spectrum licenses from EchoStar. The deal involves EchoStar selling its AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses in exchange for $8.5 billion in cash and $8.5 billion in SpaceX stock, valued at $17 billion total. This acquisition significantly expands Starlink's Direct to Cell service capabilities, which is considered the largest 4G coverage provider worldwide, connecting over 6 million users. The transaction represents a strategic move to consolidate satellite communications infrastructure under Musk's control, raising concerns about telecommunications monopolization and the concentration of critical communications infrastructure in private hands with significant government contracts.
