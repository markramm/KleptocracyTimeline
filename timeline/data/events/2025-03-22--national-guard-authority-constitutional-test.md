title: Trump's National Guard Federalization Triggers Constitutional Crisis in California
description: In June 2025, President Trump issued a controversial memorandum ordering
  the deployment of 2,000 California National Guard personnel to Los Angeles, allegedly
  in response to protests against ICE operations. This action directly challenged
  long-standing legal precedents requiring gubernatorial consent for National Guard
  federalization under 10 U.S.C. § 12406. Governor Gavin Newsom immediately filed
  a lawsuit, arguing the deployment violated state sovereignty and exceeded presidential
  authority.

President Trump attempted to federalize the California National Guard without Governor Newsom's consent, sparking a major constitutional showdown. A federal court issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the deployment and challenging the president's authority under Title 10, marking a critical test of federal-state military control.
