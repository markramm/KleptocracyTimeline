The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 along party lines to repeal Obama-era net neutrality regulations, eliminating critical protections that prevented internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating against web traffic. The decision, championed by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, shifts internet regulation from the FCC to the Federal Trade Commission, potentially allowing major telecom companies like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T to control internet access, prioritize traffic, and create paid 'fast lanes'. This repeal represents a significant victory for telecom industry lobbyists and a potential threat to open internet principles, raising concerns about future internet accessibility and corporate control of digital infrastructure.
