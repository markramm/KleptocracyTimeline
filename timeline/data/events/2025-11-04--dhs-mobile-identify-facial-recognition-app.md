In November 2025, the Department of Homeland Security released the "Mobile Identify" facial recognition app on Google's app store, making it available to state and local law enforcement agencies deputized to work with ICE. The Trump Tyranny Tracker reported on November 4 that the app enables local police to scan faces to determine immigration status, dramatically expanding federal surveillance capabilities to thousands of local departments nationwide. According to NPR reporting on November 8 and documents obtained by 404 Media through FOIA, the app requires camera access and a Login.gov account, with code strings referencing "facescanner" and "FacePresence" indicating built-in face capture functionality. The system does not return a name but produces a reference number instructing officers to contact ICE for further direction, telling officers either to detain the person or take no action. A DHS document obtained through FOIA states individuals cannot refuse to be scanned. CBP has not publicly addressed how Mobile Identify's facial data will be governed, what retention periods apply, or what auditing and oversight measures exist when local police use the app. David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, called it a "big leap" that DHS can now have agents simply point their phone at someone's face and instantly learn details about them, noting the technology threatens anonymity in public. The lack of transparency makes it difficult to challenge mistaken detentions or understand the reliability of underlying facial recognition algorithms. This infrastructure creates a domestic surveillance apparatus that can be weaponized for political targeting and monitoring of marginalized communities.
