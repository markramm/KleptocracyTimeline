The White House fired Robert E. Primus from the Surface Transportation Board via email without providing any cause, removing an independent regulator responsible for overseeing rail mergers and transportation policy. The Surface Transportation Board is designed to operate independently from political pressure to ensure fair competition and prevent monopolistic practices in the rail industry. Primus's removal came after he cast dissenting votes on major rail merger decisions that would have benefited industry consolidation. The firing exemplifies the Trump administration's systematic dismantling of independent regulatory oversight to enable corporate mega-mergers and crony capitalism. By removing regulators who prioritize public interest and competition over industry preferences, the administration clears the path for railroad monopolies that increase costs for shippers and consumers while enriching a small number of rail executives. The email termination without explanation demonstrates contempt for regulatory independence and the rule of law governing appointment and removal of board members.
