President Trump signed an executive order titled 'Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again' mandating that all new federal public buildings embrace classical architecture styles to 'honor tradition, foster civic pride, and inspire the citizenry.' The order represents an unprecedented assertion of presidential control over federal aesthetic and design standards, overriding established processes involving professional architects, local communities, and federal agencies.

The executive order directs the General Services Administration and other federal agencies to prioritize classical and traditional architectural styles, explicitly rejecting modernist and contemporary approaches. This micromanagement of architectural design demonstrates how executive power can extend into domains traditionally governed by professional standards, local preferences, and agency expertise.

Beyond aesthetic preferences, the order reflects broader patterns of centralizing authority and imposing top-down cultural mandates. By dictating architectural styles through presidential decree, the administration asserts control over public spaces and federal identity in ways that bypass democratic input and professional consensus, transforming public buildings into vehicles for ideological messaging.
