The Trump administration's Justice Department agreed to pay nearly $5 million to settle a $30 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Ashli Babbitt, the January 6 rioter shot by Capitol Police while attempting to breach the House chamber. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed extreme disappointment, stating the settlement sends a "chilling message to law enforcement nationwide".
