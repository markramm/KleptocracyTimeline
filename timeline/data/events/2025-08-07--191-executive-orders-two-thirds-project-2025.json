    "summary": "By August 7, 2025, President Trump had signed 202 executive orders, with independent analyses confirming that approximately two-thirds mirror the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 proposals - an agenda Trump previously disavowed during his campaign. Key domains include civil rights dismantling, gender policy reversion, energy deregulation, and border security militarization.\n\nKey Policy Domains:\n- Civil Rights: Elimination of diversity and affirmative action programs\n- Gender Policy: Rescinding LGBTQ+ protections\n- Energy: Expanding fossil fuel drilling\n- Border Security: Militarizing immigration enforcement\n\nNotable contributors to Project 2025 like Brendan Carr, Russ Vought, Tom Homan, John Ratcliffe, and Pete Hoekstra have direct connections to Trump's current administration, revealing a systematic implementation of the Heritage Foundation's authoritarian blueprint.",
