Republican-linked political committees have spent $676,457 at Trump properties in the six months following the 2024 election. The Republican National Committee led with $372,215, while House campaigns and Trump's political machine contributed an additional $250,000. This spending pattern demonstrates ongoing financial self-dealing through political infrastructure.
