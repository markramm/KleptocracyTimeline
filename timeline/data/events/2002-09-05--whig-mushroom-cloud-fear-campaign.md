In a pivotal White House Iraq Group (WHIG) meeting, chief Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson proposed the "smoking gun/mushroom cloud" metaphor to systematically exploit nuclear fears and generate public support for the Iraq War. This meeting exemplified the group's sophisticated propaganda tactics, designed to escalate rhetoric about Iraq's alleged threats and build momentum for invasion.
