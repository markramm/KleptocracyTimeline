title: Tech Billionaires Block Trump Military Deployment to San Francisco
---

After urgent calls from Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Salesforce's Marc Benioff, and OpenAI's Sam Altman, President Trump scrapped plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco. The reversal came after a 25-minute call with Mayor Daniel Lurie, demonstrating how billionaire access overrides constitutional checks and democratic governance. Trump's original troop deployment threat was designed to punish a Democratic city, but wealthy tech executives wielded personal influence to protect their business interests. The episode reveals that military deployment decisions—constitutionally matters of national security—can be reversed through private lobbying by billionaires with direct access to Trump. The incident exemplifies oligarchic capture of government, where economic elites exercise veto power over presidential actions affecting their interests while ordinary citizens lack similar influence.
