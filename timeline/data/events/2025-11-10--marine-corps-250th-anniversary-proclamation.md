President Trump issued a proclamation on November 10, 2025, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps, established by the Second Continental Congress on November 10, 1775. The proclamation highlighted pivotal moments in Marine Corps history, including the first combat operation at Nassau in 1776, the Battle of Belleau Wood in World War I where Marines earned the nickname 'Devil Dogs,' and major Pacific theater victories at Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa during World War II. The proclamation dedicated substantial focus to the February 19, 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima, noting that '22 Marines received the Medal of Honor for their valor, the most ever awarded for a single battle in American history.'

Beyond ceremonial recognition, the proclamation emphasized Trump's commitment to military modernization, stating the administration would commit 'more than $150 billion to forge a leaner, more lethal force fit for the twenty-first century,' with investments in shipbuilding, missile defense, and advanced military capabilities. This represents a continuation of Trump's pattern of using military ceremonies and commemorations to promote increased defense spending and emphasize his administration's military buildup priorities. The proclamation called upon government officials to display the U.S. flag on government buildings and encouraged all Americans to 'hold appropriate ceremonies as an expression of our Nation's gratitude and respect for the Marine Corps' valiant heritage,' closing with the Marine Corps motto 'Semper Fidelis' (always faithful).

Vice President JD Vance, the first Marine veteran to serve as Vice President, participated in the Marine Corps' 250th birthday ball celebrations, marking a significant milestone as the Marine Corps community celebrated a quarter millennium of service. The anniversary represents both a ceremonial acknowledgment of Marine Corps history and an opportunity for the Trump administration to emphasize military strength and readiness as core elements of its national security strategy.
