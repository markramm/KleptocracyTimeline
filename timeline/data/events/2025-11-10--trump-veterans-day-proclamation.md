President Trump issued his Veterans Day proclamation on November 10, 2025, proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day and calling on Americans to honor military veterans through public ceremonies and private reflection. The proclamation opened with traditional language: 'The story of America is written with the courage, honor, and dedicated service of our veterans. Through their sacrifice, the fires of freedom burn brightly, our Republic secured, and our way of life made possible.' Trump called upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag and participate in patriotic activities honoring veterans.

The proclamation highlighted two specific Trump administration policy initiatives: an Executive Order to build the National Center for Warrior Independence, which aims to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans by 2028, and the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' that made the 2017 Trump Tax Cut permanent and ended taxes on Social Security for most seniors. The inclusion of tax policy in a Veterans Day proclamation represents an unusual mixing of ceremonial veteran recognition with partisan economic legislation, using the authority and symbolism of a military holiday to promote Trump's domestic policy agenda.

This proclamation follows earlier controversy from May 2025 when Trump initially proposed changing the name of Veterans Day to 'Victory Day for World War I,' generating significant backlash from veterans' organizations and military families who viewed the proposed name change as disrespectful to veterans of all conflicts. The White House eventually backed off the full renaming but settled for keeping the Veterans Day name while adding a separate proclamation hailing American victory in World War I. The November 10 proclamation maintained the traditional Veterans Day designation, avoiding renewed controversy over the holiday's name and focus.
