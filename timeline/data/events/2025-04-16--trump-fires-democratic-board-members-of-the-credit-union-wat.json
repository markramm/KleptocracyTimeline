  "summary": "President Trump removed two Democratic board members, Todd Harper and Tanya Otsuka, from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), leaving the agency with only one Republican board member. The removals sparked legal challenges, with a federal judge later ruling that the firings were likely illegal, as board members could only be removed for cause.",
