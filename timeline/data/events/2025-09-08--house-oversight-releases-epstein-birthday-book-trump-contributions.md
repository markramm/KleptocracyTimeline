The House Oversight Committee released Jeffrey Epstein's 238-page birthday book "The First Fifty Years," compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The album contains two deeply disturbing contributions connected to Donald Trump that reveal the culture at Mar-a-Lago and Trump's relationship with Epstein.

The first item is an alleged birthday note from Trump featuring a crude hand-drawn outline of a naked woman with "Donald" signed in the pubic area, accompanied by typewritten dialogue between Trump and Epstein discussing shared interests and ending with "A pal is a wonderful thing." Trump's signature appears below the woman's waist "mimicking pubic hair" according to Wall Street Journal reporting.

The second item, created by Joel Pashcow (a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club), shows a photo of Epstein holding a novelty check for $22,500 with "DJTRUMP" signature. The accompanying note jokes that Epstein sold a "fully depreciated" woman to Donald Trump for that amount. This page explicitly depicts Trump as purchasing a woman from Epstein, presented as humor acceptable within Mar-a-Lago social circles.

The birthday book also lists contributions from other prominent figures including former President Bill Clinton, attorney Alan Dershowitz, and entrepreneur Leslie Wexner. Trump immediately denied authorship of both items, claiming "it's not his signature" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. House Oversight Chair James Comer (R) blocked Democratic requests for handwriting expert analysis to authenticate the signature.

The release is significant because it provides physical documentary evidence of Trump's social relationship with Epstein and the sexually objectifying culture at Mar-a-Lago where "jokes" about purchasing women were considered acceptable contributions to a birthday album. The "fully depreciated" language treats women as depreciating assets, reflecting the dehumanizing attitudes within Epstein's social circle.
