Multiple pro bono legal networks emerged in 2025, including the Pro Bono Litigation Corps (PBLC) by Lawyers for Good Government, the Federal Workers Legal Defense Network by We The Action, and the Nonprofit Legal Defense Network. These initiatives aim to provide comprehensive legal support for individuals and organizations facing constitutional challenges, focusing on democracy protection, federal worker rights, and nonprofit sector defense.
