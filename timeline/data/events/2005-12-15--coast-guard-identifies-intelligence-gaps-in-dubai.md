title: Coast Guard Identifies Critical Intelligence Gaps in Dubai Ports World Deal
description: In December 2005, Coast Guard intelligence officials concluded that significant
  intelligence gaps existed that prevented a comprehensive threat assessment of the
  potential Dubai Ports World (DPW) port management merger. The unclassified report
  stated that broad information deficiencies made it impossible to fully evaluate
  potential risks related to DPW's operations, personnel, and potential foreign influence
  supporting terrorist activities.
