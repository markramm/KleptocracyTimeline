In a strategic move, Sali Berisha, an indicted Albanian opposition leader, hired Continental Strategy, a Trump-linked lobbying firm led by Chris LaCivita, to advise his party's 2025 parliamentary election campaign. Berisha hopes to leverage these connections to potentially overturn US sanctions imposed for alleged corruption.
