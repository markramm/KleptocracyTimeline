  "title": "DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation Into Black Lives Matter Foundation for Alleged Donor Fraud",
  "summary": "On October 30, 2025, the Associated Press revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into whether leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement defrauded donors who contributed tens of millions of dollars during racial justice protests in 2020. The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, has involved federal law enforcement officials issuing subpoenas and serving at least one search warrant targeting the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. and other Black-led organizations.\n\nThe probe focuses on the foundation's handling of more than $90 million in donations collected following the May 2020 killing of George Floyd. The investigation intensified scrutiny of the organization's financial practices, particularly after BLM leaders confirmed in 2022 that they used donations to purchase a $6 million Los Angeles-area property that includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation responded by stating it \"is not a target of any federal criminal investigation,\" though the foundation acknowledged ongoing inquiries. The investigation had been initiated during the Biden administration but received renewed attention and resources under the Trump administration.\n\nCivil rights advocates and legal experts expressed concerns that the investigation represents part of a broader pattern of the Trump DOJ targeting social justice organizations and movements critical of conservative policies. While questions about BLM's financial management had been raised by donors and activists across the political spectrum for several years, the timing and scope of the federal criminal investigation raised questions about potential political motivations. Previous investigations into the nonprofit's finances had not yielded proof of criminal impropriety, though the organization faced criticism over transparency and governance issues.",
