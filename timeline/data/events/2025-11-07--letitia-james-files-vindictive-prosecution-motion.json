  "title": "Letitia James Files Vindictive Prosecution Motion to Dismiss Federal Charges",
  "summary": "New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a comprehensive motion on November 7, 2025, arguing for dismissal of federal mortgage fraud charges as vindictive and selective prosecution orchestrated by President Trump for political revenge. The motion follows an October 9, 2025 indictment charging James with bank fraud for allegedly saving $594 annually on a mortgage by misrepresenting a Norfolk, Virginia property's use\u2014charges brought after career prosecutors determined there was insufficient evidence. James' motion argues the prosecution is retaliatory for her successful $450 million civil fraud case against Trump and his organization, citing Trump's repeated public demands that Attorney General Pam Bondi prosecute her. The motion details how U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert was forced to resign in September 2025 after refusing to bring charges, and how Trump's former personal attorney Lindsey Halligan was installed to secure the indictment over career prosecutors' objections. Under the court's schedule, the Justice Department must respond by November 21, James will file a further response by November 28, and a hearing on the vindictive prosecution motion is scheduled for December 5, 2025. This motion parallels James Comey's similar arguments in his case, with both defendants challenging Halligan's constitutional authority and arguing systematic DOJ weaponization. James' trial is scheduled for January 26, 2026, with her legal team led by prominent attorney Abbe Lowell.",
