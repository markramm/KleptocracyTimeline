  "summary": "William Pulte, Trump's FHFA Director, accesses private mortgage application data to accuse Fed Governor Lisa Cook of fraud for listing two properties as primary residences, part of pattern targeting Trump's political opponents.",
  "description": "Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte sends criminal referral to DOJ accusing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud based on her 2021 mortgage applications. Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accessed Cook's private mortgage documents showing she listed properties in Michigan and Georgia as primary residences two weeks apart. This represents unprecedented weaponization of government mortgage databases against political opponents, with Pulte having made similar accusations against Senator Adam Schiff and NY AG Letitia James. Cook is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.",

  "notes": "This marks unprecedented use of government mortgage databases for political targeting. Pulte accessed private financial records through FHFA's oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which process most US mortgages. The targeting of Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed Board, occurs amid Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as Trump demands. Pattern shows systematic use of mortgage application technicalities (primary residence declarations) to manufacture criminal referrals against political opponents.",
