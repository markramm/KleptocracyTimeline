National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned on February 13, 2017, after just 24 days in office—the shortest tenure in the 63-year history of the position. Flynn's resignation came after revelations that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence, other White House officials, and the FBI about his December 2016 conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak regarding U.S. sanctions against Russia.

On January 24, 2017, Flynn gave false statements to FBI investigators about the nature and extent of his discussions with Kislyak, lying about whether he had discussed sanctions. Flynn had told Pence and other officials he did not discuss sanctions, leading Pence to publicly defend Flynn on CBS News on January 15, stating Flynn "did not talk with Kislyak about sanctions." This was a lie that Flynn allowed Pence to repeat publicly.

Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned White House Counsel Don McGahn on January 26, 2017—just one day before Trump demanded loyalty from FBI Director Comey at dinner—that Flynn had misled the FBI and could be compromised by Russian blackmail. Despite this warning, Trump kept Flynn in his position for 18 more days, during which Flynn continued to attend classified briefings and national security meetings.

The timeline reveals Trump's complicity: Yates warned the White House on Jan 26, Trump demanded FBI loyalty on Jan 27, and Trump fired Yates on Jan 30 for refusing to defend the Muslim ban—while keeping Flynn, whom Yates had identified as compromised, in his national security position. Flynn finally resigned only after The Washington Post published details of the Kislyak calls on February 9, 2017, forcing the administration's hand.

Trump later admitted in a tweet that he knew Flynn had lied to the FBI at the time of firing, which Mueller investigators viewed as potential evidence of obstruction of justice. Flynn would later plead guilty to lying to the FBI and cooperate with the Russia investigation.
