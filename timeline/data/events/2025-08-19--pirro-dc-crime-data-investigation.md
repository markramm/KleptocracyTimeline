US Attorney Jeanine Pirro launched a Justice Department investigation into whether DC police manipulated crime statistics to make rates appear lower, despite violent crime being down 26% and at a 30-year low. The investigation provides justification for Trump's federal takeover of DC police and deployment of 800 National Guard troops.

Context: One MPD commander was suspended in May over data alteration allegations, which he denied. Pirro's office is expanding the investigation to other police and city officials. Trump and the police union cited alleged data manipulation to justify the emergency takeover despite record-low crime. Pirro was Senate-confirmed in August 2025 after serving as Interim US Attorney since May.

Significance: Investigating local police for data manipulation while ignoring actual crime declines manufactures justification for federal occupation. Using DOJ to validate political narratives rather than pursue genuine wrongdoing weaponizes law enforcement. The investigation creates a pretext for military control of the capital and provides a blueprint for federal takeovers of other cities based on manufactured crises.
