Trump announced federal takeover of Washington DC's police department and deployment of 800 National Guard troops, invoking emergency powers under the Home Rule Act of 1973. DEA Administrator Terry Cole was designated interim federal commissioner. Attorney General Pam Bondi assumed command despite violent crime being down 32% in 2024 and another 12% in 2025.

Context: Neither MPD nor Mayor Muriel Bowser were informed of the takeover, which the mayor called 'unsettling and unprecedented.' Trump's control requires congressional approval after 30 days to extend beyond the emergency period. Data shows violent crime at historic lows, with 187 homicides in 2024 (down 32%) and 99 through August 2025 (down 12%).

Significance: Seizing control of a local police force using fabricated crime emergencies establishes precedent for military occupation of Democratic cities. Deploying troops despite record-low crime demonstrates emergency powers being weaponized for political control rather than public safety. The DC takeover serves as a blueprint for federal override of local governance nationwide.
