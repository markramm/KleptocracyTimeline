  "summary": "Republican operatives Charlie Black, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone founded Black, Manafort & Stone in 1980, pioneering the modern lobbying industry. The firm became infamous as the 'Torturers' Lobby' for representing dictators including Ferdinand Marcos, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Jonas Savimbi. A 1992 Center for Public Integrity report detailed how the firm earned millions whitewashing brutal regimes while maintaining close ties to Republican administrations, with Donald Trump as their first client.",

The firm was acquired by Burson-Marsteller in 1991 and later merged to form BKSH & Associates in 1996.
