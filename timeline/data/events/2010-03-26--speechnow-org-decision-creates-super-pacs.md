notes: The DC Circuit applied Citizens United logic to rule that groups making only
  independent expenditures can accept unlimited contributions. The FEC subsequently
  allowed creation of 'super PACs' - independent expenditure-only committees. This
  decision transformed Citizens United from theoretical corporate speech rights into
  practical unlimited spending vehicles that would channel billions into elections.
status: confirmed

DC Circuit Court of Appeals rules that independent expenditure committees can accept unlimited contributions from individuals and corporations, directly applying Citizens United reasoning to create modern Super PACs
