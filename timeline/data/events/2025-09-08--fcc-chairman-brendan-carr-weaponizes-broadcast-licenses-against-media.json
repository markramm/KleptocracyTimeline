  "title": "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr Threatens to Revoke Broadcast Licenses Over News Coverage",
  "summary": "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr threatened to revoke Comcast's broadcast license over NBC's news coverage, tied merger approvals to pro-Trump settlements, and backed regulatory rules designed to boost conservative media outlets. Carr's actions represent unprecedented weaponization of broadcast licensing authority to punish media companies for coverage critical of Trump, violating First Amendment principles that have protected editorial independence since the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine. Legal experts note that the FCC lacks statutory authority to revoke licenses based on content, but Carr's threats create a chilling effect where broadcasters self-censor to avoid regulatory retaliation. This follows Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS that was settled for $16 million, suggesting a pattern where Trump uses both litigation and regulatory pressure to silence critical coverage. The FCC's capture by loyalists transforms an independent agency into a tool for suppressing press freedom.",
