Trump signed an executive order directing the Transportation Department to slash FAA regulations on rocket launches, eliminating or expediting environmental reviews for commercial spaceflight. The order directly benefits SpaceX, whose owner Elon Musk repeatedly complained about FAA environmental impact studies and licensing reviews.

Context: The order calls for eliminating 'outdated, redundant or overly restrictive rules' and replacing the civil servant leading FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation with a political appointee. It creates a new Transportation Department position dedicated to deregulation. SpaceX leads all U.S. entities in launch frequency, and Musk has publicly criticized FAA reviews as needlessly slowing Starship testing.

Significance: Dismantling environmental protections to benefit a specific billionaire's business exemplifies regulatory capture. The order converts safety oversight into political appointee control, enabling industry to self-regulate while externalizing environmental costs onto communities. SpaceX's unprecedented access to eliminate inconvenient regulations demonstrates how concentrated wealth buys policy changes benefiting private interests over public safety.
