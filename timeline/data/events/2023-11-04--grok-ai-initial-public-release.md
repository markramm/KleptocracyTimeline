Elon Musk's xAI launched Grok, an AI chatbot positioned as a competitor to ChatGPT, with a deliberately provocative 'rebellious' approach. Initially available only to X Premium+ subscribers, Grok was marketed as a witty alternative to existing AI models, capable of answering controversial questions. The launch raised significant discussions about AI safety, content moderation, and the ethical implications of AI designed to be deliberately unfiltered.
