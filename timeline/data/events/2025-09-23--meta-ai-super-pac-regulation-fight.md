Meta announced the launch of the American Technology Excellence Project, its second super PAC in a month, pledging tens of millions of dollars to elect 'tech-friendly politicians' from both parties in the 2026 midterms. The PAC—run by Republican operative Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions—aims to fight state-level AI regulation, with over 1,100 tech policy proposals introduced in 2025 alone that Meta claims could hurt U.S. competitiveness with China. The announcement came one month after Meta paid Trump $25 million to settle his suspension lawsuit and donated $22 million to his White House ballroom. This represents direct corporate capture of the political process, where big tech companies pour unlimited money into super PACs to block regulation while simultaneously paying Trump directly through lawsuit settlements and construction funding.
