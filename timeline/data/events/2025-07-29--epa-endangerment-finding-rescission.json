  "date": "2025-07-29",
  "importance": 6,
  "summary": "EPA proposed July 29, 2025, rescinding 2009 Endangerment Finding underpinning all U.S. greenhouse gas regulations. Administrator Zeldin called it \"largest deregulatory action in history,\" saving $54 billion annually. Proposal claims CAA Section 202(a) doesn't authorize climate regulations, questions scientific record. Comment period through Sept 22, virtual hearings Aug 19-21.",

  "notes": "Proposal advances 3 arguments: 1) CAA Section 202(a) doesn't authorize climate standards 2) 2009 Finding unreasonably analyzed science 3) No vehicle tech can meaningfully address climate without greater harm. D.C. Circuit upheld finding in 2023, SCOTUS refused to hear case. Would eliminate legal basis for all EPA GHG regulations if finalized. Major environmental deregulation targeting foundational climate rule.",
