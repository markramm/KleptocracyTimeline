On October 27, 2025, Elon Musk's xAI unveiled Grokipedia, an AI-powered online encyclopedia with over 800,000 articles, positioning it as a competitor to Wikipedia. Musk announced the early beta on October 6, claiming it would deliver a 'more fact-based, unbiased knowledge base.' However, independent analysis by Wired immediately found Grokipedia's articles displayed a right-leaning political bias along with scientific and historical inaccuracies. This launch represents a strategic move to control information infrastructure and shape public knowledge through AI-generated content that reflects the political biases of its creators. By October 2025, Grok had reached 151 million total monthly visitors (27.8 million unique), surpassing Claude. The Grokipedia launch demonstrates how tech oligarchs are building parallel information ecosystems that can propagate misinformation at scale while claiming objectivity, undermining trusted knowledge sources like Wikipedia's community-edited model.
