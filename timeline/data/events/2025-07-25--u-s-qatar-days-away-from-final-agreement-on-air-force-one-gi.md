The Trump administration diverted funds from the Pentagon's Sentinel nuclear missile modernization program to retrofit a luxury Qatari Boeing 747-8 jet as a potential Air Force One, with conversion costs estimated between $400 million and $1 billion. The gift raises significant ethical questions about budget allocation and potential foreign influence.
