notes: Private jet worth $100k+. Singer's hedge fund had 10+ cases before SCOTUS.
  Alito got WSJ to publish preemptive defense before ProPublica story. Never recused
  from Singer cases. Voted in Singer's favor for $2.4B Argentina judgment.

ProPublica exposes Samuel Alito's 2008 luxury Alaska fishing trip with hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer who later had business before the court, revealing potential judicial ethics violations and conflicts of interest. Alito preemptively disputes in WSJ op-ed, PBS News Hour provides additional scrutiny.
