North Carolina Republicans advanced mid-decade congressional redistricting explicitly designed to eliminate the seat of Black Democratic Representative Don Davis and secure another House seat for the GOP. State Senator Ralph Hise openly acknowledged the partisan motivation, making no attempt to justify the redistricting on legitimate grounds such as population changes. The maneuver undermines democratic representation through racial and partisan gerrymandering, targeting a minority representative specifically to dilute Black voting power. Mid-decade redistricting—outside the normal decennial census cycle—demonstrates Republicans' willingness to manipulate electoral boundaries whenever politically advantageous. The naked partisan power grab exemplifies systematic efforts to entrench Republican control through manipulation of democratic processes rather than winning votes through policy appeals.
