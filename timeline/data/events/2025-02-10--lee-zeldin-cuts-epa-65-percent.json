  "summary": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to cut EPA workforce by approximately 23% and reduce the agency's budget by 65%, representing the most aggressive environmental deregulation in agency history. The cuts would return EPA staffing to Reagan-era levels, eliminating scientific research capacity and terminating $20 billion in climate grants.",
  "description": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who received $186,000 for undisclosed paid op-eds including defending Brazilian beef producer JBS, announces plans to cut EPA workforce by 65% and eliminate scientific research arm. Terminated $20 billion in climate grants which courts found lacked sufficient evidence of fraud. Previously defended companies with major environmental violations.",

His $186,000 in undisclosed paid op-eds defending polluters like JBS (major deforestation contributor) shows pattern of corporate advocacy. Terminating $20 billion in climate grants without evidence of fraud demonstrates arbitrary use of power. Eliminating scientific research arm ensures future policy decisions lack empirical basis, enabling unlimited pollution.",
