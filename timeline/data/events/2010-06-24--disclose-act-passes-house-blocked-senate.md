notes: The DISCLOSE Act would have required corporate political advertisers to reveal
  funding sources and required whoever funds ads to appear and claim responsibility.
  Obama criticized Republican leadership for hoping 'special interests will reward
  them by funding attack ads against their opponents.' This legislative failure ensured
  dark money groups could operate without transparency.
