President Trump committed $40 billion in U.S. assistance to bail out Argentina's economy while explicitly tying aid to President Javier Milei's reelection prospects, stating he would 'cut it off' if Milei loses. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent assembled a $20 billion private finance facility backed by major banks to support Argentina's debt, with Bessent's associates appearing positioned to benefit from the arrangement. Trump's weaponization of U.S. foreign aid to influence another nation's democratic election represents a severe abuse of power and violation of diplomatic norms. The bailout—using American taxpayer funds to prop up an ideologically aligned foreign leader—demonstrates how Trump subordinates U.S. foreign policy to personal political preferences. Days later, Trump announced plans to import Argentine beef, betraying U.S. ranchers while rewarding the country receiving massive aid.
