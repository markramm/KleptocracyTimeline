title: Binance Paid $450K to Trump Jr. Ally for Zhao Pardon Lobbying

Binance paid $450,000 to lobbying firm Checkmate Government Relations, run by Donald Trump Jr.'s ally Ches McDowell, in the months before Trump pardoned convicted money-launderer Changpeng Zhao. The lobbying campaign coincided with Binance forming a high-level task force to negotiate with World Liberty Financial—the Trump family's crypto venture—and facilitating a $2 billion Emirati investment using Trump stablecoins. The pardon followed a clear transactional pattern: Binance enriched Trump family businesses, hired Trump-connected lobbyists, and received a presidential pardon eliminating criminal consequences and Justice Department oversight. The arrangement demonstrates how Trump's pardon power functions as a commodity available for purchase through his family's business ventures and political allies. The Zhao pardon exemplifies systematic corruption where legal accountability evaporates for those who financially benefit Trump's interests.
