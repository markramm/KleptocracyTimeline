The Justice Department reassigned prosecutors from North Carolina to lead the case against James Comey following internal upheaval after Trump appointee Lindsey Halligan pushed through the indictment over career prosecutors' objections. The reassignment followed the purge of two senior Virginia prosecutors who resisted the politically motivated charges. This prosecutor shuffling demonstrates the systematic transformation of the Justice Department into a political weapon, where career prosecutors who maintain independence are removed and replaced with officials willing to advance retaliatory prosecutions against Trump's perceived enemies.
