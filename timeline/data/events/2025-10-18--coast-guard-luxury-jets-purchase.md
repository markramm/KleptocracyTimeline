Department of Homeland Security purchased two Gulfstream G700 luxury jets for Secretary Kristi Noem at a cost of $172 million—more than triple the original $50 million request. The purchase occurred during the government shutdown while 1.4 million federal workers remained unpaid and many resorted to food banks. DHS cited 'safety' to justify the extravagant expenditure despite operating under fiscal constraints that prevented paying civilian employees. The jets represent the latest example of Trump administration officials prioritizing personal luxury and privilege while imposing austerity on the federal workforce. The massive cost overrun—from $50 million to $172 million—raises questions about procurement oversight and whether the luxury specifications were necessary or simply desired by Noem. The purchase exemplifies regime elites' sense of entitlement to taxpayer-funded opulence amid economic hardship for ordinary government workers.
