Analysis of Trump's first week in office reveals approximately 65% of his executive actions closely align with Project 2025 recommendations, despite previously claiming no association. Key areas of implementation include dismantling DEI programs, reviving Schedule F to reclassify federal employees, restricting transgender rights, and reducing refugee admissions.
