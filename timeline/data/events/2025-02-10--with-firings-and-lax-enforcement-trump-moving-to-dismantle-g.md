title: Trump Systematically Removes Key Government Ethics and Whistleblower Protection
  Officials
description: Trump systematically removed key government oversight officials, firing
  the heads of the Office of Government Ethics (David Huitema) and the Office of Special
  Counsel (Hampton Dellinger), and the National Archivist (Colleen Shogan). These
  removals follow a pattern of eliminating independent oversight, with Doug Collins
  appointed as acting head of multiple agencies. Dellinger filed a lawsuit challenging
  his removal, arguing it violated legal protections for the Special Counsel position.
