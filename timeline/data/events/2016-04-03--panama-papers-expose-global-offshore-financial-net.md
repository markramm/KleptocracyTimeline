The Panama Papers was a groundbreaking investigative journalism project coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in 2016. Based on 11.5 million leaked documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm, the investigation exposed a complex global network of offshore financial entities used by political leaders, celebrities, and business elites to hide wealth, avoid taxes, and potentially engage in illegal financial activities.

The leaked documents revealed how over 214,000 offshore companies were used to:
- Conceal ownership of assets
- Evade international sanctions
- Hide potential criminal financial activities
- Enable large-scale tax avoidance

Key impacts included:
- Resignation of Iceland's Prime Minister
- Resignation of Spain's Minister of Industry
- Imprisonment of Pakistan's Prime Minister
- Hundreds of tax investigations worldwide
- Closure of Mossack Fonseca law firm in 2018

The investigation represented a landmark moment in global investigative journalism, demonstrating the power of collaborative international reporting in exposing systemic financial corruption.
