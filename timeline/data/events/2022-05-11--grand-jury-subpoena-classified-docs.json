  "title": "Grand jury issues subpoena demanding all classified documents from Trump",
  "summary": "A federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring Trump to return all documents \"bearing\nclassification markings\" in his possession. This legal demand came after the National\nArchives discovered classified materials in boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's\nalleged failure to fully comply with this subpoena, including moving boxes to conceal\ndocuments from his attorney's search, became central to the obstruction charges filed\nagainst him in 2023.\n",
