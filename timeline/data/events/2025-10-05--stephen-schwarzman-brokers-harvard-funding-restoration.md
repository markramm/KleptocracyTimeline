Blackstone CEO and Trump ally Stephen Schwarzman emerged as key broker between Harvard University and the White House over billions in frozen federal research funds. Schwarzman negotiated terms for restoring the funding, conditioning it on Harvard's institutional adoption of Trump administration policies. This represents the weaponization of federal research funding to coerce academic institutions into political compliance, with a billionaire Trump ally serving as intermediary. The arrangement demonstrates how federal resources are leveraged for ideological control, with private sector figures acting as enforcers of political orthodoxy in higher education.
