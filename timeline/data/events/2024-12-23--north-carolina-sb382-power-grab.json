  "title": "North Carolina Republicans Strip Governor's Power to Appoint Election Board Members",
  "summary": "North Carolina's SB 382, deceptively framed as \"disaster relief,\" transferred power to appoint State Board of Elections members from Democratic Governor Josh Stein to Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek, effective May 2025. Unprecedented power grab enacted after Democrats won governorship. Governor Cooper and Governor-elect Stein filed suit December 23, 2024, citing constitutional violations. Law passed during lame duck session specifically to prevent incoming Democratic governor from appointing election oversight board. Represents systematic effort to control election machinery.",
