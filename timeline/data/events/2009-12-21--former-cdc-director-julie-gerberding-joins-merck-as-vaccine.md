Dr. Julie Gerberding, who served as CDC Director from 2002-2009, joined Merck as president of the company's vaccine division shortly after leaving government service. This move sparked significant controversy because during her tenure at the CDC, Gerberding oversaw the agency's recommendation of Merck's Gardasil HPV vaccine in 2006, helping make it a $5 billion blockbuster drug. Critics pointed to this as a classic example of the 'revolving door' between government health agencies and pharmaceutical companies. Gerberding has since benefited financially from Merck stock options, cashing out over $16 million to date, including $9.1 million in sales in January 2024. The appointment raised questions about potential conflicts of interest in vaccine policy development and highlighted concerns about CDC officials' future career prospects influencing their regulatory decisions while in government service.
