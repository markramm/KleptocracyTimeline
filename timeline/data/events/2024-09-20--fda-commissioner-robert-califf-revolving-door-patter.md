FDA Commissioner Robert Califf faces ongoing criticism for his extensive pharmaceutical industry ties. Having received over $8 million from drug companies and worked as a consultant for major pharmaceutical firms, Califf pledged to extend post-employment restrictions from 2 to 4 years to mitigate 'revolving door' concerns. His connections include consulting roles with Merck, Biogen, Eli Lilly, and a leadership position at Verily Life Sciences (Alphabet).
