The New York State Appellate Division, First Department, threw out the massive financial penalty imposed on President Donald Trump by Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron, which had risen to more than $500 million with interest. The appeals court ruled the penalty violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines, sparing Trump from a potential half-billion-dollar obligation.

However, the five-judge panel upheld Judge Engoron's core finding that Trump and his associates committed business fraud by systematically overstating the value of real estate assets owned by the Trump Organization to secure favorable loan terms and insurance rates. The court also imposed limited corporate leadership bans on Trump and his two eldest sons for several years.

The ruling represents a significant judicial victory for Trump during his presidency, eliminating the largest financial penalty he faced while maintaining the fraud finding. New York Attorney General Letitia James announced she would appeal to the state's highest court to reinstate the fine. The case had taken the appeals court nearly 11 months to decide after oral arguments, an unusually long deliberation period that raised questions about the court's handling of a politically sensitive case involving a sitting president.
