notes: Bondi's immediate elimination of units investigating foreign influence and
  recovering oligarch assets signals administration's openness to foreign corruption.
  The KleptoCapture unit had recovered over $5 billion in Russian oligarch assets
  supporting Ukraine. The Foreign Influence Task Force investigated election interference
  and foreign lobbying violations. Their elimination removes key mechanisms for combating
  foreign corruption while Bondi herself has received millions from Trump businesses,
  creating massive conflicts of interest.
