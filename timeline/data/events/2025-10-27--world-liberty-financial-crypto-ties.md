Bloomberg investigation revealed Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao months after Binance's infrastructure supported World Liberty Financial—the Trump family's crypto venture—in deals that generated over $500 million for the Trump family. Binance provided critical technical support, facilitated a $2 billion Emirati investment using Trump stablecoins, and formed a high-level task force to negotiate with Trump's family business. The timing exposes how Trump's pardon power functions as compensation for business deals that enrich his family, creating a pay-for-pardon system. World Liberty Financial's dependence on Binance infrastructure meant Zhao's pardon directly benefited Trump family business interests. The arrangement demonstrates the complete merger of Trump's presidential authority with family profit-seeking, where criminal pardons become transactional benefits exchanged for business relationships.
