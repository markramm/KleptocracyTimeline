ICE lifted the stop work order on its $2 million contract with Israeli spyware maker Paragon, granting the agency access to 'Graphite' spyware capable of bypassing encryption on WhatsApp, Signal, and Facebook Messenger. The software uses 'zero-click exploits' that force phones to read infected files without user input. The Biden administration had paused the contract in September 2024 to review compliance with executive orders on commercial spyware, but Trump's ICE reactivated it on August 30, 2025. In January 2025, WhatsApp revealed that around 90 users including journalists and human rights workers had been targeted with Paragon's spyware, leading Italy to cut ties with the company. The reactivation exemplifies how Trump transformed immigration enforcement into a surveillance state operation with warrantless access to encrypted communications.
