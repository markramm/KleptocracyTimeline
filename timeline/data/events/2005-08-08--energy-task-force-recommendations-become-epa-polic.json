  "title": "Energy Task Force Recommendations Become EPA Policy Without Review",
  "summary": "Vice President Cheney's Energy Task Force recommendations were implemented as EPA environmental policy through executive orders, bypassing Congressional oversight and public comment periods required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Task force members from ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other oil companies wrote policy language that EPA adopted verbatim, including reduced monitoring requirements and expanded drilling permits. EPA career staff later testified that political appointees prohibited scientific review of policies originated by industry task force members. This established systematic corporate control over regulatory policy-making through captured executive processes.\n\nKey findings reveal the task force held approximately 40 meetings with energy industry representatives between January and April 2001, deliberately excluding environmental groups. The National Energy Policy report strategically recommended keeping global warming technology issues away from the EPA to prevent potential emissions regulations. This systematic approach allowed energy companies to directly shape environmental policy, establishing a clear pattern of regulatory capture through executive branch manipulation.",
