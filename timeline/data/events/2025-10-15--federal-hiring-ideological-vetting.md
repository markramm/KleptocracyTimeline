President Trump replaced the federal hiring freeze with an executive order mandating that political appointees approve all new government hires through 'strategic hiring committees,' converting civil service into a partisan screening mechanism. The order transforms federal employment from merit-based system into political patronage operation where ideological loyalty trumps qualifications or expertise. Every federal hiring decision now requires approval from Trump-appointed political operatives, enabling systematic exclusion of anyone deemed insufficiently loyal. The shift dismantles civil service protections established to prevent political interference in government operations and ensure competent administration. By requiring political vetting for all positions, Trump converts the entire federal workforce into an extension of his political operation. The order represents foundational transformation from professional civil service to authoritarian patronage system.
