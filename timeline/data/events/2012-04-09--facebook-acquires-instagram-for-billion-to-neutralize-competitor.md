Facebook acquired photo-sharing app Instagram for  billion, implementing what the FTC would later characterize as a 'buy or bury' strategy to eliminate competitive threats. Internal emails revealed CEO Mark Zuckerberg explicitly stated the acquisition was motivated by a desire to 'neutralize a potential competitor' rather than enhance services. The FTC approved the acquisition despite its anticompetitive intent, demonstrating regulatory capture as Facebook successfully concealed key information about its monopolistic strategies from regulators.
