notes: "This represented one of the most brazen attempts at self-dealing, as Trump\
  \ tried \nto use the presidency to direct government contracts to his failing business.\
  \ \nThe Doral resort had seen massive revenue declines since Trump took office,\
  \ and \nhosting G-7 would have provided a significant financial boost. The reversal\
  \ only \ncame after Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the plan, showing\
  \ even \nTrump's allies recognized the constitutional violation was too obvious\
  \ to defend.\n"

President Trump proposed hosting the 2020 G-7 summit at his Trump National Doral 
golf resort in Miami, which would have directed millions in government spending 
to his struggling property. Trump claimed Doral was "by far the best physical 
facility" and offered to host "at cost," but the proposal would have required 
foreign governments to pay Trump's business directly. After bipartisan backlash 
and accusations of constitutional violations, Trump reversed course on October 19, 
2019. Financial disclosures showed Doral's revenue had declined 69% since 2015.
