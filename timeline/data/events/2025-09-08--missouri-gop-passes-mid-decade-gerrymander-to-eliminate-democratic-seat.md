Missouri's Republican-controlled legislature advanced new congressional maps that would reduce Democratic representation from two seats to one by dismantling Representative Emmanuel Cleaver's Kansas City district. The mid-decade redistricting, normally only done after census years, represents an aggressive power grab enabled by Trump administration encouragement of gerrymandering nationwide. The new maps split Kansas City into multiple districts to dilute Black voting power and ensure Republican control of seven of Missouri's eight House seats. Combined with similar mid-decade redistricting efforts in other states, this represents a coordinated strategy to lock in Republican congressional majorities regardless of voter preferences. Legal challenges are expected, but the Supreme Court's 2019 Rucho v. Common Cause decision limiting federal courts' ability to strike down partisan gerrymandering provides states broad latitude for electoral manipulation.
