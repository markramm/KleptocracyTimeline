SSA Chief Data Officer Charles Borges filed a comprehensive whistleblower complaint revealing a critical data security breach. DOGE employees, including Ed Coristine, created an unsecured cloud copy of the NUMIDENT database containing sensitive personal information for over 300 million Americans. SSA cybersecurity officials classified the breach as 'very high risk', with potential consequences including mass Social Security number reissuance.
