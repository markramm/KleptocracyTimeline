Trump demanded Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign immediately over alleged China ties, claiming he is 'highly conflicted' due to $200 million in investments in Chinese semiconductor firms. Days later, Trump reversed course after meeting Tan, calling his 'success and rise an amazing story.'

Context: Tan replaced Pat Gelsinger as Intel CEO in March 2025. Reuters investigation revealed Tan invested at least $200 million in 20+ Chinese advanced manufacturing and semiconductor companies through his venture funds, including firms with links to China's military. Intel receives billions in CHIPS Act funding to build domestic semiconductor capacity.

Significance: Presidential interference in corporate leadership decisions replaces market dynamics with executive intimidation. Trump's flip-flop after a meeting suggests policy outcomes depend on personal negotiations rather than consistent principles, demonstrating corporate America operating under presidential threat and favor rather than rule of law.
