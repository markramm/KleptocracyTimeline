The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act was introduced in the US House of Representatives, targeting Russian officials responsible for human rights violations and corruption. Named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who exposed a $230 million tax fraud scheme and subsequently died in Russian custody, the act authorized sanctions against individuals involved in his death and related corruption.
