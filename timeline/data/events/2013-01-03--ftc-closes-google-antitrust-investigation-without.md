title: Google's Political Influence Derails FTC Antitrust Investigation
description: In a landmark moment of regulatory capture, the FTC closed its investigation
  into Google's potentially anticompetitive practices, ignoring recommendations from
  its own staff attorneys who believed Google was causing "real and substantial harm"
  to competitors. The investigation revealed the extensive political infrastructure
  Google had built, including 230 White House meetings and significant lobbying expenditures.

The Federal Trade Commission closed its 19-month antitrust investigation of Google without bringing charges, despite internal staff recommendations for legal action. With 230 White House meetings in 2012-2013, Google demonstrated unprecedented political access, ultimately avoiding significant regulatory consequences.
