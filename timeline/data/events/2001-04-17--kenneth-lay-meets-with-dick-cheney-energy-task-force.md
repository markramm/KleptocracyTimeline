Enron CEO Kenneth Lay met privately with Vice President Dick Cheney during a pivotal Energy Task Force meeting, presenting corporate recommendations that would significantly shape U.S. energy policy. Out of eight policy areas, seventeen Enron-favorable policies were adopted, including federal transmission line control and limited price controls. Environmental groups argued that industry executives like Lay were key players, while alternative voices were systematically excluded.
