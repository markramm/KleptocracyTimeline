The PGA Tour announced Trump National Doral will host the Miami Championship signature event April 30-May 3, 2026, with a $20 million purse. This marks the first PGA Tour event at a Trump property in a decade, directly enriching the president's business while serving in office.

Context: Doral's Blue Monster hosted PGA tournaments annually from 1962-2016, ending with the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The PGA Tour distanced itself from Trump properties after January 6, 2021. LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed tour, is pulling out of Doral for 2026 after holding events there since 2022. The announcement came while Trump serves as president, creating direct financial benefits to his business empire.

Significance: A sitting president receiving millions in revenue from a major sporting organization creates textbook conflicts of interest. The PGA Tour's return after years of separation suggests Trump's presidential power influences business decisions that enrich him personally. The reversal from ostracizing Trump properties to hosting premier events demonstrates how presidential office converts into direct business profit.
