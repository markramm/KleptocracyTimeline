  "title": "Supreme Court Overturns Chevron Deference, Reshaping Administrative Law",
  "summary": "In a landmark 6-2 decision, the Supreme Court overruled the 40-year-old Chevron deference doctrine in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, fundamentally altering the balance of power between courts and federal agencies. The ruling requires courts to independently interpret ambiguous statutes rather than deferring to agency expertise, potentially undermining regulatory capabilities across multiple sectors.",
