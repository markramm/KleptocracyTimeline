OMB Director Russell Vought blocked billions in congressionally-approved public funding, including over $5 billion in SNAP benefits for hungry families, claiming unilateral power to withhold spending despite the Impoundment Control Act prohibiting such actions. Vought confirmed considering 'pocket rescissions'—allowing spending to expire before agencies can allocate funds.

Context: Trump and Vought argue the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, enabling them to refuse spending Congress approved. Critics note Vought's 'pocket rescission' strategy circumvents Congress by delaying fund distribution until appropriations expire. In August, USAID's closure was formally transferred to Vought, expanding his authority. House Democrats documented systematic law violations depriving communities of bipartisan resources.

Significance: Claiming presidential power to override congressional appropriations undermines core separation of powers. Blocking food assistance to assert executive supremacy demonstrates how constitutional boundaries can be ignored to centralize power. The strategy of deliberately delaying spending until it expires enables de facto line-item veto, fundamentally altering the balance between executive and legislative branches.
