Acting Attorney General James McHenry systematically fired multiple Justice Department officials who worked on Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump's election interference and classified documents case. In termination letters, McHenry argued the officials could not be trusted to 'faithfully implement the President's agenda', raising significant concerns about prosecutorial independence and potential political retaliation.
