FBI Director Kash Patel fired approximately 15-20 agents photographed kneeling during 2020 George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C., reversing previous FBI leadership's determination that the agents—using a de-escalation tactic borrowed from National Guard—committed no policy violations. The agents had been deployed by Attorney General Bill Barr for crowd control despite lacking training for such duties, and their kneeling successfully defused tensions. Top officials under former Director Christopher Wray reviewed the incident and cleared the agents, but Patel's 2025 reassessment resulted in demotions and firings as part of efforts to root out 'woke' elements. The FBI Agents Association accused Patel of violating agents' constitutional and legal rights. This represents ideological purging of law enforcement for protected First Amendment expression and effective policing tactics.
