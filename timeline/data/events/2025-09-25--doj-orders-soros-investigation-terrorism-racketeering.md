On September 25, 2025, Aakash Singh, a senior official in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office, sent a directive to U.S. attorney's offices in at least seven states—including California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, and Maryland—ordering them to prepare investigations into the Open Society Foundations, the philanthropic organization funded by billionaire George Soros. The directive listed potential charges prosecutors should consider, including material support for terrorism, arson, wire fraud, and racketeering.

The order came days after President Trump publicly stated in a Fox News interview that Soros was "a likely candidate" for prosecution and should be investigated for racketeering. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance had specifically singled out Soros in public comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a staunch Trump ally. The directive represents an unprecedented targeting of one of America's most prominent philanthropists and Democratic donors, raising serious concerns about the weaponization of the Justice Department against political opponents.

The Open Society Foundations responded by unequivocally condemning terrorism and stating that "our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law." The organization characterized the investigation as "politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech." Legal experts and civil liberties advocates expressed alarm at the directive, noting it represents a dangerous expansion of DOJ's targeting of nonprofit organizations based on their political activities and the political views of their founder.
