Justice Department whistleblower Erez Reuveni, a 15-year DOJ attorney, revealed in October 2025 testimony that senior officials ordered him to fabricate terrorist claims in court briefs to justify the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Reuveni was told to argue in legal filings that Abrego Garcia was an 'MS-13 gang member' and a 'terrorist' despite no evidence supporting these claims. When Reuveni refused, stating 'That is not correct. That is not factually correct. It is not legally correct. That is a lie. And I cannot sign my name to that brief,' he was placed on administrative leave seven hours later for 'failure to follow a directive' and fired on April 11, 2025. The full facts revealed Abrego Garcia had been deported by mistake. Reuveni's disclosure, filed with the Government Accountability Project in June 2025, documented over 35 cases where judges specifically cited false government information, possibly intentionally false, including false sworn declarations. The case demonstrates systematic abuse of the legal process, with DOJ officials instructing attorneys to defy court rulings and fabricate evidence to cover illegal mass expulsions.
