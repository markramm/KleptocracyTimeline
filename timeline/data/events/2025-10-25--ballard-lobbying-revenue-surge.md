title: MAGA-Aligned Lobbying Firms Quadruple Revenue Selling Trump Access
---

MAGA-aligned lobbying firms, led by Ballard Partners (founded by Trump fundraiser Brian Ballard), have quadrupled revenue as corporations seek influence on tariffs, healthcare, and China policy through Trump's inner circle. Major clients including Harvard, TikTok, and Fortune 500 companies pay millions for access to administration officials, creating a systematic pay-for-play environment where policy outcomes depend on lobbying expenditures rather than public interest. Ballard Partners employees include Pam Bondi (now Attorney General) and Susie Wiles (White House Chief of Staff), demonstrating the revolving door between Trump's lobbying operation and government positions. The lobbying surge reflects corporate America's recognition that Trump administration policy is for sale to the highest bidder. The arrangement transforms governance into a transactional system where regulatory decisions, contracts, and policy favors flow to those who pay lobbyists with Trump connections.
