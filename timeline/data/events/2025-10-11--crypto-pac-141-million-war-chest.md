Cryptocurrency industry super PAC Fairshake reported holding $141 million in cash as of July 2025, surpassing what it spent during the entire 2024 election cycle, as the crypto industry prepares for an 'even bigger 2026 push' to elect allies and defeat critics. In 2024, crypto interests poured more than $40 million into the Ohio Senate race alone—four times their spending in any other Senate contest—successfully defeating Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who headed the Senate Banking Committee and was one of Washington's toughest critics of digital assets. The industry spent over $130 million total in congressional races in 2024. Fairshake spokesperson Josh Vlasto declared the group would 'continue to support pro-crypto candidates and oppose anti-crypto candidates—in Ohio and nationwide.' The massive war chest represents political weaponization of deregulatory policy, with crypto money fused directly with power to handpick candidates and rewrite financial laws. This demonstrates regulatory capture at industrial scale, with a single industry buying wholesale control over legislative outcomes through unprecedented campaign spending.
