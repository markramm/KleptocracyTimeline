Senate Democrats flagged Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's firm Cantor Fitzgerald for creating financial products allowing clients to bet on Supreme Court tariff rulings, raising insider dealing concerns. Lutnick, a top tariff negotiator, is father of Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick.

Context: Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden and Banking Chair Elizabeth Warren wrote to Cantor Fitzgerald about trades based on legal challenges to Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs. The firm had internal discussions about facilitating tariff outcome trades for hedge funds but claims it shut down the idea before executing transactions. Howard Lutnick was Cantor Fitzgerald CEO until becoming Commerce Secretary in early 2025.

Significance: A cabinet official architecting tariff policy while his family's firm profits from tariff uncertainty creates textbook conflicts of interest. The ability to trade on policy outcomes designed by a related party enables sophisticated insider dealing, demonstrating how administration officials can enrich connected firms through privileged policy information and regulatory decisions.
