Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth introduced a 'next generation' Pentagon press corps dominated by far-right outlets including The Gateway Pundit, Infowars, and LindellTV after mainstream journalists rejected restrictive access rules requiring loyalty pledges. Over 30 major news outlets surrendered Pentagon credentials rather than submit to political vetting and editorial restrictions. The replacement of independent journalism with propaganda outlets eliminates critical oversight of military operations and defense policy. Hegseth's press corps purge ensures only Trump-friendly outlets receive official information, converting Pentagon communications into a state media operation. The action follows Trump's broader pattern of suppressing independent media while empowering partisan outlets to serve as administration mouthpieces. The transformation of Pentagon media access represents systematic dismantling of free press oversight of military power.
