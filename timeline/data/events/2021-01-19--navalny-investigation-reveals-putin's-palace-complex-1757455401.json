  "title": "Navalny Investigation Reveals Putin's Palace Complex",
  "summary": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny released a detailed investigation exposing a lavish palace complex on the Black Sea allegedly built for Vladimir Putin. The investigation, titled 'Putin's Palace: History of World's Largest Bribe,' detailed a $1.35 billion estate featuring luxury amenities including a casino, theater, and ice hockey rink. The 17,691 square meter palace sits on a 7,000 hectare estate, making it 39 times larger than Monaco. Navalny's team used drone footage, satellite imagery, and insider testimony to document the construction funded through a corruption scheme involving Putin's inner circle. The investigation implicated oligarchs and government officials in the largest known example of personal enrichment by a sitting head of state. Within days of release, the video gained over 100 million views, sparking widespread protests across Russia.",
