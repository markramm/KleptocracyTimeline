President Trump nominated 30-year-old Paul Ingrassia, a political loyalist with ties to far-right media, to lead the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), a government agency responsible for investigating federal employee misconduct and protecting whistleblowers. Ingrassia's nomination sparked significant controversy due to his limited legal experience and connections to controversial political figures.
