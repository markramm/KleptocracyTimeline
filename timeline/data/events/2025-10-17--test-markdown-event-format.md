This is a test event in markdown format to verify that the new markdown parser is working correctly.

The event demonstrates:
- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata
- Markdown content for the summary
- Support for multiple paragraphs
- Proper source formatting

This markdown event should be parsed exactly like a JSON event and appear in search results.
