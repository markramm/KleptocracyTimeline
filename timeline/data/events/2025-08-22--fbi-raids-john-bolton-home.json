    "title": "FBI Raids Home and Office of Trump Critic John Bolton",
    "summary": "On August 22, 2025, the FBI executed simultaneous, court-authorized searches of John Bolton's Maryland home and Washington, D.C. office, seizing electronic devices and documents related to potential classified information mishandling. The raid stems from an ongoing investigation into Bolton's 2020 memoir, 'The Room Where It Happened', and represents a significant escalation in political tensions.\n\nKey Details:\n- 10 FBI agents conducted synchronized searches at 7:00 a.m.\n- Search warrant authorized by CIA Director John Ratcliffe\n- Seized items: two phones, multiple computers, binders labeled 'Trump I-IV'\n- Follows previous legal disputes over Bolton's 2020 memoir publication\n\nPolitical Context:\n- Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor (April 2018 - September 2019)\n- Known for being a vocal critic of the Trump administration post-resignation\n- Secret Service protection withdrawn immediately after Trump's inauguration\n\nImplications: The raid underscores growing tensions between political critics and the current administration, raising serious questions about potential weaponization of law enforcement and the boundaries of national security investigations.",
