The Federal Railroad Administration initiated preliminary discussions with Elon Musk's Boring Company regarding the Frederick Douglass Tunnel project, a critical infrastructure initiative to replace a 150-year-old rail tunnel between Baltimore and Washington. The project, initially estimated at $6 billion and now projected at $8.5 billion, represents a potential engineering contract opportunity for Musk's tunneling company.
