  "title": "Proud Boys, Oath Keepers Convicted of Seditious Conspiracy for January 6",
  "summary": "Leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were convicted of seditious conspiracy for coordinating the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol that killed 5 and injured 140 police officers. Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio received 22 years, the longest January 6 sentence, despite not being in D.C. that day. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes got 18 years after stockpiling weapons at a Virginia hotel for a 'quick reaction force.' Evidence showed both groups coordinated the assault to stop Congress from certifying Biden's victory. Over 1,100 people have been charged, with 600+ receiving prison sentences. The House January 6 Committee's 814-page report, based on 1,000+ witness interviews, recommended criminal charges against Trump for obstruction, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting insurrection. These were the first seditious conspiracy convictions since 1995.",
