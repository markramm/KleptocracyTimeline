title: Congressional Iraq Authorization Vote Based on WHIG Fabrications
description: Congress votes to authorize the use of military force against Iraq based
  on systematically fabricated intelligence and manipulated threat assessments produced
  by the White House Iraq Group (WHIG). The vote represents a critical failure of
  democratic oversight, with Congress approving military action based on deliberately
  distorted intelligence from key White House officials.
significance: Democratic process fundamentally corrupted by systematic executive branch
  deception of the legislative branch, resulting in unauthorized war based on fabricated
  evidence. The WHIG's actions demonstrate a profound breakdown of institutional checks
  and balances, with executive manipulation overriding congressional due diligence.

Congress authorizes military force against Iraq through a vote systematically manipulated by the White House Iraq Group (WHIG), which deliberately distorted intelligence assessments. This vote represents a critical moment of democratic failure, where executive manipulation bypassed congressional oversight to justify an unauthorized war.
