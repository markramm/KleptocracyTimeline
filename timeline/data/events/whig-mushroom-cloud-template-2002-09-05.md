WHIG meeting produces "smoking gun/mushroom cloud" metaphor via speechwriter Michael Gerson, demonstrating systematic propaganda coordination. Strategy leaked to New York Times reporters and deployed by Rice on CNN September 8 ("We dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud") and Bush October 7 speech. Represents template for crisis-driven messaging coordination that bypasses democratic deliberation.
