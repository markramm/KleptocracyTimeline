The federal workforce was reduced by 59,000 employees in the first five months of 2025, with an additional 154,000 federal workers accepting the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), marking the largest single-year exodus of civil servants in nearly 80 years. This reduction aligns with the Trump administration's Project 2025 goals of 'dismantling the administrative state'.
