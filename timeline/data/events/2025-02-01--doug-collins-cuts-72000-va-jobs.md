description: Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins announces elimination of 72,000
  VA jobs - 15% of workforce - while claiming "no cuts to benefits" despite these
  workers directly providing veteran healthcare and services. Cuts target medical
  staff, claims processors, and mental health counselors serving 9 million veterans.
  Collins previously voted against expanding VA healthcare while in Congress.

notes: Collins's claim of "no cuts to benefits" while eliminating 72,000 jobs providing
  those benefits exemplifies administration doublespeak. The 15% workforce reduction
  targets the exact employees delivering healthcare, processing disability claims,
  and providing mental health services to 9 million veterans. This follows pattern
  of claiming to support veterans while systematically dismantling the infrastructure
  serving them. Collins's congressional record of opposing VA expansion reveals long-term
  hostility to veteran services.
