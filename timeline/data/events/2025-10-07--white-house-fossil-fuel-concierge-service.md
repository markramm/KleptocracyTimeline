Senior Trump energy adviser Brittany Kelm publicly admitted the White House provides 'white glove service' to oil, gas, and coal companies, fast-tracking their projects through federal approvals while simultaneously freezing renewable energy initiatives. The National Energy Dominance Council operates as an industry-capture mechanism, prioritizing fossil fuel profits over energy transition, climate concerns, and balanced energy policy. This formalization of preferential treatment for specific industries represents systematic regulatory capture, where government agencies abandon neutral administration to serve as facilitators for favored corporate interests.
