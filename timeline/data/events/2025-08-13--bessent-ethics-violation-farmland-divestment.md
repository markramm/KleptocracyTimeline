Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent missed the 90-day ethics deadline for divesting conflicted assets, retaining up to $25 million in North Dakota farmland generating up to $1 million annually in rental income. Bessent owns soybean and corn farmland while shaping agricultural trade policy and farm subsidy decisions.

Context: Bessent was confirmed February 28, 2025, requiring full divestiture by April 28. The Office of Government Ethics granted an extension to December 15, 2025. Treasury officials explained the farmland is 'illiquid,' though Bessent completed 96% of other required divestitures. The holdings create direct conflicts of interest as Bessent oversees trade negotiations and agricultural policy.

Significance: Treasury Secretary holding agricultural assets while setting farm policy exemplifies systemic conflicts of interest enabling self-dealing. Ethics extension mechanisms allow officials to maintain profitable holdings while making policy decisions that directly affect their financial interests, undermining governance integrity.
