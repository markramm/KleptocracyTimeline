The US Commerce Department adds surveillance technology vendors Intellexa and Cytrox to the Entity List for "trafficking in cyber exploits used to gain access to information systems, threatening the privacy and security of individuals and organizations worldwide." Specific entities sanctioned include Intellexa S.A. (Greece), Cytrox Holdings Crt (Hungary), Intellexa Limited (Ireland), and Cytrox AD (North Macedonia). This action expands US efforts to combat the global spyware industry beyond Israeli companies to European-based consortiums. In a subsequent escalation, the US Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions in March 2024, targeting specific individuals and entities within the Intellexa Consortium for developing 'Predator' spyware used to target Americans, including government officials, journalists, and policy experts.
