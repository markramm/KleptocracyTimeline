  "title": "IMF Imposes Harsh Structural Adjustment on Indonesia",
  "summary": "The IMF provided a $10 billion bailout to Indonesia in November 1997, imposing stringent structural adjustment conditions that demanded banking sector reforms, public spending cuts, and market deregulation. These policies, while intended to stabilize the economy, resulted in significant social upheaval, massive inflation, and ultimately contributed to the fall of the Suharto regime in May 1998.",
