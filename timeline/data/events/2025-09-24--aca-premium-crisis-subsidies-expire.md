Kaiser Family Foundation analysis revealed that enhanced ACA premium tax credits helping over 20 million Americans afford health coverage are set to expire December 31, 2025, triggering an average 114% premium increase ($1,016 annually). Households at 150-200% of poverty level would see premiums rise over 400% (from $180 to $905 annually), while families earning over 400% of poverty would lose credits entirely—forcing a family of four with $130,000 income to pay $11,450 more per year. As open enrollment approached in November, Trump and congressional Republicans refused to extend the subsidies, deliberately engineering a healthcare crisis to undermine the Affordable Care Act. This represents sabotage of healthcare access for political purposes, forcing millions to choose between coverage and financial ruin.
