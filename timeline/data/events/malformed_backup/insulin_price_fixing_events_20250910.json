    "date": "2016-11-03",
    "description": "Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings sent a letter to the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission requesting investigation into potential collusion among pharmaceutical companies manufacturing diabetes products. The lawmakers cited a pattern where prices for insulin sold by Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk often rose in tandem over several years, with the cost of insulin more than tripling from $231 to $736 per year per patient between 2002 and 2013. They specifically noted 13 instances since 2009 where Sanofi and Novo Nordisk insulin brands raised prices in lockstep, expressing concern about coordinated pricing driving up costs for millions of Americans with diabetes.",

    "description": "Alec Raeshawn Smith, 26, was found dead in his apartment from diabetic ketoacidosis, 27 days after losing health insurance coverage when he aged out of his mother's plan. Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 23, Smith faced $1,300 monthly costs for diabetes supplies without insurance—most of that for insulin—while earning $35,000 annually as a restaurant manager. He made too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford available insurance plans with premiums of $450 per month and $7,600 annual deductibles. His death became a symbol of the deadly consequences of the insulin price-fixing cartel's artificially inflated prices, which forced patients to ration life-saving medication they could not afford.",

    "date": "2019-06-15",
    "description": "Josh Wilkerson, 27, died from diabetes-related complications after switching to over-the-counter Walmart insulin when he could no longer afford prescription insulin costing $1,200 per month. After aging out of his stepfather's insurance at 26, Wilkerson consulted his endocrinologist who suggested Walmart's $25 insulin as an alternative. However, this older human insulin takes up to four hours to become effective versus 30 minutes for newer insulins. Wilkerson experienced severe complications including exhaustion, stomach pain, and increased aggression. He was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis, blood sugar at 1,700, and brain swelling that caused strokes. His family removed life support on June 14, and he died June 15, 2019. His death highlighted how the insulin price-fixing cartel's inflated costs forced patients into dangerous rationing behaviors and substandard treatments.",
