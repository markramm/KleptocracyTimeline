    "date": "2005-10-13",
    "description": "The FAA formally established the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program, allowing aircraft manufacturers like Boeing to delegate certification responsibilities to their own employees. This marked a fundamental shift from direct FAA oversight to industry self-regulation, with Boeing eventually certifying 96% of its own work by 2018.",

The crash was caused by a malfunctioning MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) that repeatedly pushed the aircraft's nose down due to faulty angle-of-attack sensor data, a system that pilots were not informed about during training.",
