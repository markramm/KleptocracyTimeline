    "date": "1995-12-12",
    "description": "The FDA approves Purdue Pharma's OxyContin with controversial labeling claiming 'delayed absorption, as provided by OxyContin tablets, is believed to reduce the abuse liability of a drug.' This approval was overseen by Dr. Curtis Wright IV, who allowed Purdue to help draft his medical officer's review and met secretly with company representatives in a hotel near FDA offices. The approval was based on theory rather than rigorous clinical studies designed to assess abuse potential, despite Wright knowing this claim was unsubstantiated. This misleading label language would become central to Purdue's aggressive marketing campaign that fueled the opioid epidemic.",

    "date": "1998-12-01",
    "description": "Dr. Curtis Wright IV, the FDA medical review officer who approved OxyContin in 1995, joins Purdue Pharma as Executive Director for Risk Assessment and Health Policy with a compensation package exceeding $379,000 annually. This move occurred less than three years after Wright overseen the controversial approval process where he allowed Purdue to help draft his medical officer's review and approved the misleading 'reduced abuse liability' label language. Wright's transition from regulator to regulated represents one of the most egregious examples of the pharmaceutical industry revolving door, raising serious questions about conflicts of interest in the FDA approval process that enabled the opioid epidemic.",

    "description": "Purdue Frederick Company Inc. (Purdue Pharma affiliate) and three top executives plead guilty to criminal charges of misbranding OxyContin by falsely claiming it was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other opioids. The company pays $634 million in fines while executives Michael Friedman, Howard R. Udell, and Paul D. Goldenheim pay $34.5 million in personal fines. Despite making $2.8 billion in revenue from OxyContin from 1996-2001, evidence shows Purdue trained sales representatives to falsely tell doctors that addiction risk was 'less than one percent' and continued deceptive practices even after this plea agreement. This represents one of the largest pharmaceutical fraud settlements at the time, yet failed to adequately deter the company's ongoing deceptive marketing practices.",
