Foreign governments including Israel, Hungary, and South Korea are paying MAGA-aligned content creators to promote diplomatic talking points without proper disclosure under Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requirements. Israel provided $70,000 for influencer trips to Gaza and the Golan Heights to shape U.S. public opinion on Israeli policies. Hungarian and South Korean governments have similarly funded conservative influencers to advance their interests with Trump's base. The payments represent foreign interference in U.S. political discourse, with foreign governments essentially purchasing favorable coverage from influencers who present the content as independent commentary. DOJ has not enforced FARA against these activities, creating a loophole where foreign governments can covertly shape American political opinion by paying Trump supporters. This is particularly concerning as these influencers have significant reach and their audiences are unaware the content is foreign-funded propaganda.
