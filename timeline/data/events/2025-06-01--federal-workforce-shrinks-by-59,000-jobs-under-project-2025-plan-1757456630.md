Federal workforce reduced by 59,000 positions with additional 154,000 employees on paid administrative leave through deferred resignation program designed to accelerate exodus of career officials, implementing Project 2025's government reduction goals. OMB Director Russell Vought explicitly stated the goal is to 'traumatically affect' federal employees, targeting workers whose jobs are not statutorily required.
