The Trump Justice Department initiated a systematic surveillance operation targeting Washington Post journalists Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller, and Adam Entous between April 15 and July 31, 2017. The operation was part of an aggressive effort to identify sources and suppress national security journalism related to the Russia investigation. The DOJ secretly seized phone records and metadata, targeting reporters who were covering the federal investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.
