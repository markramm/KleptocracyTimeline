Alnur Mussayev, former chief of Kazakhstan's National Security Committee, alleged that Vladimir Putin possesses comprehensive kompromat files on Donald Trump, linking Trump to the Epstein network. Mussayev claims the FSB holds materials documenting financial transactions, sexual crimes, and potential blackmail material. However, these allegations remain unverified, with significant credibility questions surrounding Mussayev's claims.

Key claims include:
- Alleged detailed financial records of illicit transactions
- Claimed audio/video evidence of sexual crimes
- Suggestion of strategic manipulation of Trump's political actions
- Connections to Epstein's trafficking networks

Fact-checking organizations have raised substantial doubts about the veracity of Mussayev's allegations, noting inconsistencies in his career timeline and lack of corroborating evidence.
