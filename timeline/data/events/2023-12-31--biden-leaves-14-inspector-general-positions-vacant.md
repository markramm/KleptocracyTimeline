The Biden administration maintained 14 Inspector General vacancies across federal agencies, with some positions unfilled for over 2,000 days, severely weakening government oversight. The Export-Import Bank IG position remained vacant since June 2014 (2,664 days), while Treasury's IG spot was empty for over 5 years. Key agencies lacking permanent IGs included Defense (515+ days), State Department, and Office of Personnel Management. Despite calls from watchdog groups like Project On Government Oversight (POGO), Biden also failed to remove compromised DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari after findings he 'engaged in conduct undermining independence' and 'abused authority.' POGO's Daniel Schuman noted the administration 'has been slow to fill the positions,' creating obstacles to crucial oversight duties during a period of expanded government spending and emergency authorities.
