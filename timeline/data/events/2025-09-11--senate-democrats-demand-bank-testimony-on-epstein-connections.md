Ten Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, called for Senate Banking Committee hearings requiring testimony from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other banking leaders regarding their institutions' ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Reports revealed that JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank ignored red flags including suspicious cash withdrawals, wire transfers to co-conspirators, and transactions flagged as potential human trafficking. The banks maintained Epstein's accounts for years after his 2008 conviction, with JPMorgan processing over $1.08 billion in suspicious transactions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has refused to provide suspicious activity reports (SARs) to Congress despite multiple requests. The Senate demand represents escalating pressure on financial institutions that enabled Epstein's trafficking operation through willful blindness to obvious criminal activity. Banking executives' refusal to testify voluntarily suggests ongoing cover-up of institutional complicity in sex trafficking.
