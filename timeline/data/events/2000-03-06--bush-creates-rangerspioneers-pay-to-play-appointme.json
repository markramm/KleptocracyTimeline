  "summary": "George W. Bush formalized an unprecedented campaign bundling system where 'Rangers' raising 00,000+ and 'Pioneers' raising 00,000+ received federal appointments. In 2000, 241 Pioneers reached their goals, contributing to Bush raising 7 million in first 4 months. By 2004, the program included 221 Rangers, 327 Pioneers, and 62 'Super Rangers' raising 8.5 million combined. The pay-to-play pipeline was systematic: 173 Rangers/Pioneers received federal appointments, including 29 ambassadors and 4 Cabinet secretaries. Key examples included Mercer Reynolds (Texas Rangers co-owner with Bush) becoming Ambassador to Switzerland, Thomas Scully (Medicare administrator) designing Part D legislation favoring donors, and Sam Fox (Swift Boat funder) becoming Belgium ambassador. Designed by Karl Rove, this represented the most extensive formalization of campaign bundling in presidential politics. Nearly 1 in 5 elite fundraisers received appointments, creating direct quid pro quo between massive donations and government positions. The system institutionalized wealthy donors' access to federal policy-making roles regardless of qualifications.",
