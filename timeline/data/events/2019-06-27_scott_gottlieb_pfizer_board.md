Pfizer announced that Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA Commissioner from May 2017 to April 2019, would join the pharmaceutical giant's board of directors as an independent member. The appointment came just 85 days after Gottlieb resigned from the FDA, raising immediate concerns about regulatory capture and the revolving door between government agencies and the industries they regulate. During his tenure as FDA Commissioner, Gottlieb had overseen numerous decisions affecting Pfizer and other major pharmaceutical companies. The move prompted Senator Elizabeth Warren to call for Gottlieb's resignation from the Pfizer board, citing conflicts of interest. Specifically, Warren argued the appointment 'smacks of corruption' due to the rapid transition from chief drug regulator to board member of a major pharmaceutical company. Gottlieb was elected to the board's regulatory and compliance, as well as science and technology committees, highlighting the direct access his FDA experience provides to Pfizer's strategic decisions.
