President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum directing federal agencies to review and repeal regulations deemed unlawful based on recent Supreme Court decisions, bypassing normal notice-and-comment procedures. The directive allows agencies to use the 'good cause' exception in the Administrative Procedure Act to remove regulations quickly, potentially impacting areas like environmental policy, economic regulation, and administrative law.
