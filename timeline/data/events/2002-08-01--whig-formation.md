Chief of Staff Andrew Card forms White House Iraq Group (WHIG), chaired by Karl Rove, to coordinate systematic messaging strategy for Iraq War. Group includes key Powell Memo-aligned figures including communications strategists Karen Hughes, Mary Matalin, and policy coordination through Condoleezza Rice and Scooter Libby. WHIG represents first large-scale implementation of Powell Memo crisis-exploitation template for rapid institutional capture acceleration. Key participants met regularly in the Situation Room to craft a coordinated narrative supporting the Bush administration's push for war in Iraq, using strategic communication tactics to build public and congressional support.
