  "title": "Consumer watchdog payouts in limbo as agency is defanged by Trump administration",
  "summary": "The Trump administration effectively paralyzed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in March 2025, freezing hundreds of millions in consumer protection payouts and halting dozens of ongoing corporate investigations. Under Acting Director Russell Vought, the agency's headquarters was shuttered and staff were instructed to cease all work, putting consumer restitution from major financial firms like Navient, Block, and TD Bank at risk.",
