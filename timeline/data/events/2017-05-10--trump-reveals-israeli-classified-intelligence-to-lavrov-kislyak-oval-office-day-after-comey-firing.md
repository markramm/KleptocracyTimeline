The day after firing FBI Director James Comey, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office and revealed highly classified code-word intelligence provided by Israel about an ISIS laptop bomb plot, jeopardizing a critical intelligence source and damaging the U.S.-Israel intelligence relationship. Trump disclosed the city in Syria where the intelligence was gathered, boasting that he gets great intel and has people brief him on great intel every day. The information came from an Israeli cyber warfare unit that had penetrated an ISIS bomb-making cell—intelligence Israel had not authorized sharing with Russia, an ally of Iran and Syria. Israeli intelligence officials were described as shouting at their American counterparts in meetings, furious that Trump may have compromised a vital source. One Israeli official said this represented their worst fears confirmed, noting the disclosure jeopardized Israel's unique intelligence sharing arrangement with America. The intelligence was code-word classified, the highest level, and Trump's careless disclosure revealed operational details that could allow Russia to identify Israel's source. No American media was allowed in the meeting, but Trump permitted Russian state photographers to attend and document the meeting. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster initially denied the report, then admitted Trump discussed ISIS threats but claimed it was appropriate. The revelation came just as Trump was under investigation for Russia connections, making the Lavrov meeting—scheduled before Comey's firing—appear even more suspicious. The incident demonstrated Trump's fundamental unsuitability for handling classified intelligence and his willingness to compromise national security to impress Russian officials.
