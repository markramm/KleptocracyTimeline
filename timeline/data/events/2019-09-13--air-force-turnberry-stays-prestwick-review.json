  "summary": "An Air Force internal review reported that about 6% (39 of 659) of aircrew overnights near Prestwick Airport were at Trump Turnberry; most crews stayed closer to the airfield or in Glasgow. Separately, DHS OIG reported about $9,662 in Secret Service payments to Turnberry for rooms, golf carts, and logistics during the President's July 2018 visit—while also noting incomplete cost data due to system limitations. The reviews raised questions about the ethical implications of government personnel staying at a resort owned by the sitting president, even when technically complying with existing policies.",
  "notes": "Present both official reviews and press tallies; emphasize that although policies may have been followed, the arrangements created perceived conflicts of interest warranting oversight scrutiny.",
