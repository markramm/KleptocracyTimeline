White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told The New York Times that "From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August," openly framing the potential Iraq War as a calculated marketing campaign. This statement exposed the White House Iraq Group's systematic approach to manipulating public perception, treating war as a consumer product to be strategically launched and sold to the American public. Card's quote demonstrated the administration's prioritization of strategic communication over democratic transparency.
