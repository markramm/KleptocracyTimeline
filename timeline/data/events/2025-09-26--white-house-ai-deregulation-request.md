On September 26, 2025, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a Notice of Request for Information in the Federal Register, soliciting public input on identifying existing federal statutes, regulations, and agency rules that 'unnecessarily hinder the development, deployment, and adoption of AI technologies.' This initiative follows the July 23, 2025 America's AI Action Plan aimed at achieving global AI dominance. The request, with comments due October 27, 2025, represents a systematic effort to dismantle AI safety guardrails and consumer protections under the guise of promoting innovation. Rather than strengthening oversight of AI systems' societal impacts—including algorithmic bias, privacy violations, misinformation amplification, and labor displacement—the administration is actively soliciting industry complaints about accountability measures. This regulatory rollback approach prioritizes corporate profits over public safety and democratic accountability in AI governance.
