notes: Thiel's essay represents a seminal moment in tech billionaire rejection of
  democratic governance. His argument that democracy inevitably leads to welfare states
  and regulation becomes foundational to the New Right movement. The essay's influence
  extends through his funding of political candidates like J.D. Vance who share this
  anti-democratic vision. Thiel specifically argues that women's suffrage made democracy
  incompatible with capitalism, revealing the reactionary core of his libertarianism.
