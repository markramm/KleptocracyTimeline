The Trump administration filed an expedited emergency petition with the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Federal Circuit's August 29 ruling that declared Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The government asked the Court to stay the Federal Circuit's decision, which had found that Trump exceeded his emergency powers authority when imposing 'reciprocal tariffs' on imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners.

The petition sets up a major constitutional showdown over presidential trade powers and emergency authority. The Federal Circuit had stayed its own ruling until October 14, 2025, to allow time for Supreme Court review. The Supreme Court announced it would hear oral arguments during the first week of November 2025, placing the case on an unusually accelerated timeline given its massive economic implications.

The case represents one of the most significant tests of presidential emergency powers in decades, with potential ramifications extending far beyond trade policy. Legal experts noted that the outcome could determine whether presidents can use emergency powers statutes as a blanket authorization for sweeping policy changes, or whether such powers are limited to genuine national security crises. The Trump administration argued that tariffs were essential to national economic security, while opponents warned that upholding them would give presidents virtually unlimited economic authority.
