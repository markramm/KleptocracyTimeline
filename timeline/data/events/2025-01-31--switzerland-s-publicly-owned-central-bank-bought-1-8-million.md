The Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank majority owned by public entities,
purchased 111,300 shares of Trump Media & Technology Group valued at $1.78 million
during Q3 2024, according to SEC disclosures. By February 2025, the bank's holdings
increased to 157,500 shares worth $5.37 million. President Trump owns approximately 53%
of Trump Media through a trust controlled by Donald Trump Jr. The purchase by a foreign
government-controlled entity raises significant Emoluments Clause concerns given Trump's
majority ownership stake in the company. Another Swiss public financial institution,
Zürcher Kantonalbank, also owns 14,796 shares worth $237,000, further complicating
the potential constitutional conflict.
