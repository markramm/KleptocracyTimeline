Ethics disclosures revealed Trump purchased at least $103 million in corporate and municipal bonds since January 20, making over 600 transactions including bonds from Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Meta, UnitedHealth, T-Mobile, and Home Depot—all companies subject to federal regulation and policy decisions.

Context: Trump began purchasing bonds on January 21, the day after inauguration. The purchases span hospitals, schools, airports, ports, gas projects, and bonds from dozens of states including Texas, Florida and New York. A White House official claimed Trump has no role in managing investments, with decisions made by a 'third-party financial institution,' though Trump benefits financially from the portfolio's performance.

Significance: A president actively purchasing bonds from heavily regulated industries while setting policy affecting those sectors creates massive conflicts of interest. Even if managed by third parties, Trump's financial interest in these companies' success incentivizes favorable regulatory treatment and policy decisions. The scale and breadth of purchases across regulated sectors demonstrates how presidential power can be converted into personal enrichment through market positions in entities he regulates.
