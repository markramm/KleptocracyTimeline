  "title": "Colin Powell Presents False WMD Evidence to UN Security Council",
  "summary": "Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a 76-minute presentation to the UN Security Council presenting fabricated evidence to justify the Iraq War. Powell's presentation included: mobile weapons labs based on testimony from 'Curveball,' a source who later admitted lying; aluminum tubes claims his own staff warned were 'not credible'; and a theatrical anthrax vial demonstration. The CIA and State Department had warned that many claims were false before the presentation. Powell later called the presentation a 'blot' on his record, acknowledging the evidence was fabricated. This false presentation became central to the Bush administration's justification for the 2003 Iraq invasion.",

The presentation became the centerpiece of the Bush administration's case for war despite internal warnings about the evidence's credibility. Powell himself later acknowledged it as a permanent 'blot' on his record.",
