The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which required federal preclearance for voting changes in states with histories of discrimination. Chief Justice Roberts argued the formula was outdated, while Justice Ginsburg warned it was 'like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.' Within hours, Texas and other states began implementing previously blocked voter restrictions. The decision enabled a wave of voter suppression laws across formerly covered states, including strict voter ID requirements, polling place closures, and voter roll purges that disproportionately affected minority communities.
