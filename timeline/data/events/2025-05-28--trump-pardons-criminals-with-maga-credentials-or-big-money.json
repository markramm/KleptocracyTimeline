  "title": "Trump Pardons Criminals with MAGA Credentials or Big Money",
  "summary": "In a systematic display of political patronage, Trump granted executive clemency to a series of convicted individuals, prioritizing wealthy campaign contributors and ardent MAGA loyalists. These pardons represent a dramatic expansion of Trump's first-term pardon strategy, transforming the presidential clemency power into a transactional political tool.",
  "description": "Trump's May 2025 pardons reveal a calculated strategy of political reward and financial quid pro quo. By granting clemency to wealthy individuals and staunch political supporters, Trump effectively monetized the presidential pardon power, using it as a mechanism for political loyalty and potential financial gain.",
