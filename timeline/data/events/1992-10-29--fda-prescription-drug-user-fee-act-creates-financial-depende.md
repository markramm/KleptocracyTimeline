title: FDA Prescription Drug User Fee Act Creates Financial Dependence on Pharmaceutical
  Industry
---

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992 fundamentally restructured FDA drug approval financing by creating a direct financial relationship between pharmaceutical companies and regulators. The Act mandated drug companies pay fees to fund FDA drug reviews, which eventually comprised up to 65% of the FDA's drug review budget. By 2025, these user fees reached $3.3 billion of the FDA's $6.9 billion total budget, raising significant concerns about regulatory independence.

Key Impacts:
- Reduced drug approval times from 31 months to 14.5 months
- Created mandatory five-year reauthorization negotiations
- Established a structural mechanism for pharmaceutical industry influence
- Shifted FDA financial dependence toward industry funding

The legislation represents a critical moment in regulatory capture, where the oversight mechanism became financially dependent on the entities it regulates.
