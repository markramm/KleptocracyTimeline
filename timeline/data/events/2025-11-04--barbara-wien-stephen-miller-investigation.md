In November 2025, the Department of Justice, FBI, and Secret Service launched an aggressive investigation into Barbara Wien, a 66-year-old retired university professor and activist from Virginia, for distributing protest fliers about White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. The Trump Tyranny Tracker reported on November 4 that Virginia authorities escalated the investigation despite the activist's age and peaceful protest activities. According to court documents reported by The Daily Caller and The Daily Beast, Wien allegedly posted fliers in Miller's neighborhood stating he was "wanted for crimes against humanity" with the slogan "No Nazis in NOVA" (Northern Virginia) and including his home address. Miller's wife Katie witnessed Wien make a gesture interpreted as "I'm watching you," which was characterized as threatening. U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala twice denied FBI petitions for a warrant to search Wien's smartphone, finding insufficient evidence of criminal activity. After federal courts rebuffed the FBI, the Millers obtained a warrant from Virginia State Police through local judge Judith Wheat on October 1. Progressive Arlington prosecutor Parisa Dehghani-Tafti made an unusual move by siding with the defense to persuade a state judge to limit the search scope and keep data from the FBI. Wien has not been charged with any crime despite the ongoing investigation. The deployment of FBI, Secret Service, and federal prosecutors to investigate a senior citizen for distributing political protest materials exemplifies the weaponization of law enforcement against First Amendment-protected dissent.
