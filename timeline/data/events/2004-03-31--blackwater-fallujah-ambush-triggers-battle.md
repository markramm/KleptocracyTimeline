Four Blackwater contractors—Scott Helvenston, Jerry Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Mike Teague—were ambushed and killed by Iraqi insurgents while conducting a delivery for food caterers ESS in Fallujah. The contractors' bodies were beaten, burned, dragged through the city streets, and hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River, producing one of the most gruesome images of the Iraq War. The incident triggered the First Battle of Fallujah, a major U.S. military operation, demonstrating how private military contractor operations could directly precipitate conventional military engagements.

The families of the victims filed a wrongful death lawsuit (Helvenston et al. v. Blackwater Security) against Blackwater USA in January 2005, arguing the company had sent the four men to Fallujah "unprepared and disorderly." A congressional investigation concurred with this assessment, finding that on the day of the ambush, Blackwater was "unprepared and disorderly." The lawsuit alleged Blackwater failed to provide:
- Proper armored vehicles (sent in unarmored vehicles instead of armored SUVs)
- Adequate personnel (sent teams of four instead of required six-person teams)
- Sufficient weapons and ammunition
- Proper intelligence briefings
- Adequate route planning

The case was settled in 2012 after seven years of litigation, with terms undisclosed. The settlement allowed Blackwater to avoid public trial that would have exposed systematic cost-cutting measures that prioritized profit over contractor safety. Internal Blackwater communications revealed the company understood the inadequate security provisions but proceeded with the mission to maintain the lucrative ESS contract.

The Fallujah ambush exposed fundamental accountability problems with privatized military operations: Blackwater's contractors exercised military functions in a combat zone but the company faced only civil liability rather than military justice or criminal prosecution for decisions that led to deaths and triggered major military operations. The incident demonstrated how private military companies could make tactical decisions with strategic military consequences while operating beyond the accountability mechanisms that govern official military forces, creating systematic gaps in command authority and legal responsibility during armed conflict.
