President Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida healthcare executive convicted of $10.9 million in tax fraud, less than three weeks after his mother Elizabeth Fago attended a $1 million-per-plate Mar-a-Lago fundraiser. Fago was previously involved in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's stolen diary during the 2020 campaign.
