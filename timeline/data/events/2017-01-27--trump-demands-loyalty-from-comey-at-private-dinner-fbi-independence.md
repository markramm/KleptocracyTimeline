President Trump invited FBI Director James Comey to a one-on-one dinner at the White House on January 27, 2017, where he directly demanded: "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." Comey had expected others to attend but found himself alone with Trump in what he later described as an attempt to create a patronage relationship fundamentally at odds with FBI independence.

Comey refused to pledge loyalty, instead responding: "You will always get honesty from me." After an awkward silence, Trump modified his demand to "honest loyalty," which Comey interpreted as continuing the inappropriate pressure to subordinate the FBI's institutional independence to personal political loyalty.

The timing of the dinner was significant: it occurred just one day after Acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned White House Counsel Donald McGahn that National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had lied about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and could be compromised by Russian blackmail. Trump's loyalty demand to Comey came as the FBI was conducting an investigation into Flynn and broader questions about Trump campaign connections to Russia.

Comey viewed the one-on-one setting as deliberately creating pressure to exchange job security for political loyalty. As FBI Director serving a 10-year term precisely to insulate the position from political interference, Comey recognized Trump's approach as threatening the FBI's constitutional role as an independent investigative agency. Comey emphasized he was not "reliable" in political terms but could "always count on me to tell you the truth."

This dinner foreshadowed Trump's pattern of demanding personal loyalty over institutional independence, which would lead to Comey's firing in May 2017 when he refused to drop the Flynn investigation and continued the Russia probe. The loyalty demand became central evidence in obstruction of justice allegations against Trump.
