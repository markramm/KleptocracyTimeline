Trump appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as Co-Deputy Director of the FBI alongside Dan Bongino, creating the first dual deputy director structure in FBI history. Bailey, a Trump loyalist who supported debunked 2020 election claims, has no FBI experience but will help run day-to-day operations traditionally managed by career veterans.

Context: Bailey will serve under FBI Director Kash Patel, another Trump loyalist. Historically, one deputy director runs FBI operations, a career position filled by respected veterans with deep FBI experience. Bailey mounted high-profile legal fights aligned with Trump's agenda as Missouri AG. He announced resignation effective September 8, 2025, to take the FBI position.

Significance: Installing partisan loyalists with no law enforcement experience into FBI leadership positions displaces career professionals with institutional knowledge. Creating a dual deputy structure enables political appointees to control operations without normal checks. The appointment demonstrates FBI transformation from independent law enforcement into a politically controlled agency serving presidential loyalty over rule of law.
