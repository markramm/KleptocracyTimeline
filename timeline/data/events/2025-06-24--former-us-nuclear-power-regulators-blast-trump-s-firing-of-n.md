  T. Hanson, a move that undermines the agency's independence and raises concerns
  about potential regulatory capture in nuclear energy oversight. The firing occurred
  after Hanson had worked to preserve the NRC's integrity, and appears to be part
  of a broader effort to reshape nuclear regulatory landscape to support industry
  interests.

In a significant move of regulatory capture, President Trump terminated Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Christopher T. Hanson on June 24, 2025. Hanson, originally appointed by Trump in 2020 and reappointed by Biden in 2024, was fired without cause, raising serious concerns about the independence of nuclear energy oversight. The action follows Trump's recent executive order mandating a 'wholesale revision' of NRC safety regulations, potentially compromising public safety to benefit industry interests.
