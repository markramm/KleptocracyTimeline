description: Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler, worth $1 billion from husband's
  Intercontinental Exchange empire, takes office despite 2020 insider trading scandal
  where she sold vulnerable stocks after private Senate coronavirus briefing. Continued
  holdings in ICE securities and cryptocurrency create direct conflicts with SBA regulatory
  responsibilities over financial markets affecting small businesses.

notes: Loeffler's appointment places someone who profited from insider information
  during national crisis in charge of small business support. Her 2020 stock sales
  after private Senate COVID briefing, dumping retail and hotel stocks while buying
  teleconferencing shares, demonstrated using government information for personal
  gain. Her $1 billion fortune from ICE, which owns NYSE and cryptocurrency exchanges,
  creates massive conflicts overseeing SBA programs affecting financial markets. Pattern
  of monetizing public service continues.
