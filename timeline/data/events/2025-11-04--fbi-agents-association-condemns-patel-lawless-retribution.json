  "title": "FBI Agents Association Issues Unprecedented Rebuke: Patel \"Disregarded the Law\" in Campaign of Retribution",
  "summary": "The FBI Agents Association issued an extraordinary public condemnation of FBI Director Kash Patel on November 4, 2025, accusing him of launching a \"campaign of erratic and arbitrary retribution\" and stating he \"disregarded the law\" in his mass firing and reinstatement of FBI personnel. The statement declared: \"Director Patel has disregarded the law and launched a campaign of erratic and arbitrary retribution. FBI Agents deal in facts, and we urge Director Patel to do the same. When leadership abandons due process, it doesn't just erode trust \u2014 it makes the American public less safe.\" The unprecedented rebuke came after Patel fired multiple senior officials linked to investigations of Trump, only to reverse some firings following intervention by Jeanine Pirro, who warned the dismissals \"would hamper work on ongoing cases.\" Chris Mattei, attorney for fired FBI official Steven D'Antuono, stated that if Patel, AG Pam Bondi, and the White House \"thought these patriots, who have dedicated their lives and careers to the Constitution and the rule of law, would lay down in the face of DOJ being used as a lawless tool for political retribution, they have another thing coming.\" The FBI Agents Association represents over 14,000 active FBI special agents, making this the first time in the bureau's history that the agents' professional association has publicly accused a sitting FBI Director of violating the law. The statement signals complete breakdown of institutional norms and loss of confidence in Patel's leadership among rank-and-file FBI agents who recognize his personnel decisions as politically motivated vengeance rather than legitimate law enforcement management.",
