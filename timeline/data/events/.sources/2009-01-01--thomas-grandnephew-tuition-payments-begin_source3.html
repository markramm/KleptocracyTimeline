Thomas did not disclose the payments, an omission that added to a growing outcry over the Supreme Court’s ethics practices that now includes criticism of both conservative and liberal justices. ProPublica reported Thursday that Harlan Crow, a prominent Republican donor, paid tuition at Hidden Lake Academy in Georgia for Mark Martin, Thomas’s grandnephew, of whom Thomas had legal custody. The report said Crow also paid Martin’s tuition at Randolph-Macon Academy in Virginia. Critics say that by not disclosing the tuition and travel that Crow has funded over the years, Thomas hid the possibility that he would feel beholden to Crow and the conservative causes he supports. Thomas’s allies insist there is nothing wrong with accepting generosity from a longtime friend and say the payments did not need to be disclosed. Also Thursday, a conservative news site questioned Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s decision not to recuse herself from two Supreme Court cases involving Penguin Random House, which publishes her books and has paid the justice about $3.6 million since 2009 — income she listed on her disclosure forms. She is not the only one with a potential conflict regarding Penguin Random House: Justice Neil M. Gorsuch has received $655,000 from the company, according to his financial disclosure reports, and he also did not recuse himself in a case that came before the court during his tenure. Thursday’s report by the Daily Wire mentioned only Sotomayor. It is not clear whether justices must recuse themselves when they receive royalties from a contract with a publisher, because profits from books are specifically exempted by law from the total outside income a judge is allowed. But ethics experts pointed to a provision in law that calls for recusal when a justice’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” A court spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. Some members of Congress, along with court reform advocates, are calling on the justices to adopt stronger, more transparent ethics policies at a time when public confidence in the high court has declined significantly. The stream of news stories raising questions about the justices’ ethical conduct is a blow to the court’s reputation that could be avoided, said Amanda Frost, a legal ethics expert at the University of Virginia School of Law. The reports are “yet another reason why the court needs clearer ethics policies,” Frost wrote in an email. “The Court could prevent this by establishing an ethics officer who can advise them on best practices and ensure consistent policies going forward.”  Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica — or The Washington Post — about the tuition arrangement for his grandnephew. The publication cited a bank statement that showed Crow paid $6,200 in monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy in July 2009, and quoted a former administrator at the school saying the Texas billionaire covered the full year’s tuition. But Thomas’s allies quickly defended the justice’s relationship with Crow as a deep, personal friendship not subject to disclosure rules and accused Democrats of a double standard in evaluating the off-the-bench activities of liberal justices. Thomas’s friend, attorney Mark Paoletta, said in a statement that Crow’s payments went directly to the schools and that Thomas was not required to report them because the definition of a “dependent child” in the Ethics in Government Act does not include a grandnephew. “Justice Thomas and his wife devoted twelve years of their lives to taking in and caring for a beloved child — who was not their own — just as Justice Thomas’s grandparents had done for him,” Paoletta said. “They made many personal and financial sacrifices to do this. And along the way, their friends joined them in doing everything possible to give this child a future.” Federal ethics law requires top officials from all three branches of government, including Supreme Court justices, to file annual financial disclosure forms listing outside income and investments. A separate judicial conduct statute allows for the filing and investigation of misconduct complaints against lower-court judges. The Supreme Court does not have such a process for misconduct complaints, or a binding ethics policy. The justices have discussed but failed to reach consensus on a policy, The Post reported this year, despite talks dating to at least 2019. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held a hearing this week to consider legislation to require ethics standards for justices similar to those for members of Congress and other high-level government officials. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. declined Durbin’s invitation to testify, citing separation-of-power concerns, and instead shared a statement from the nine justices detailing the ethical guidelines the court follows. “I hope that the Chief Justice understands that something must be done,” Durbin said in a statement Thursday. “The reputation and credibility of the Court is at stake.” Durbin said in an interview that he was uncertain whether his committee would soon vote on legislation pushing the court to adopt an ethics code. Without Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who is recovering from shingles in California, the committee would need Republican support to advance such legislation. But Durbin also declined to commit to pushing for that legislation even if Feinstein returns, saying Roberts should take that action on this own. “It’s his court. It’s his legacy,” Durbin said. “And right now, it’s his challenge to see if he’ll put the most basic change in place and say that Supreme Court justices are subject to the same rules and guidelines as every other federal judge.” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who has introduced legislation that would create a process for investigating misconduct and strengthen recusal and disclosure rules for the justices, said in a statement Thursday that the situation is “horribly wrong. … The Court has closed itself up like a turtle, pretending this is all okay.” Many Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have defended Thomas, dismissing the recent reports as an effort by liberals — and news organizations — to undermine the conservative majority that has quickly moved the court to the right. On Thursday, the Twitter account of the House Judiciary Republicans suggested with a goat emoji that the conservative justice is “the greatest of all time.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) called reports about Thomas and Crow a “hypocritical and dishonest smear job” and said the media “does not apply the same standard” for reporting on liberal justices. Crow’s office issued a statement in which it did not dispute that Crow paid for Martin’s education. “Harlan Crow has long been passionate about the importance of quality education and giving back to those less fortunate, especially at-risk youth,” the statement said. “It’s disappointing that those with partisan political interests would try to turn helping at-risk youth with tuition assistance into something nefarious or political.” ProPublica last month published a detailed report on Crow paying for Thomas’s luxury vacations. In response, the justice said he and his wife considered Crow and his wife to be “among our dearest friends” and that he had been advised he did not have to disclose the couple’s hospitality, which included travel on a private jet and yacht. Thomas has not spoken publicly about an additional report from ProPublica, which said the justice did not disclose Crow’s purchase of three properties in Savannah, Ga., from Thomas in 2014, including the single-story house where Thomas’s mother was living and two vacant lots nearby. Experts have said the $133,363 transaction should have been reported on his financial disclosure forms. Allegations from congressional Democrats that Thomas probably violated federal ethics laws have been sent to a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, made up of federal judges, that is responsible for “addressing allegations of errors or omissions in the filing of financial disclosure reports.” The heightened scrutiny has extended beyond Thomas. Politico reported last month that Gorsuch did not disclose that the chairman of a major law firm in 2017 bought a Colorado property in which the justice held an interest. Experts are debating whether he was required to report such a transaction. And there are questions about whether Sotomayor and Gorsuch should have participated in reviewing cases involving Penguin Random House, which publishes their books. The court voted in February 2020 not to hear a copyright lawsuit against the company. In 2013, before Gorsuch joined the bench, the justices turned away a petition in another case involving Random House. As is customary, such rejections do not include a vote count, but Justice Stephen G. Breyer indicated he recused himself from considering both cases. Like Sotomayor and Gorsuch, Breyer earned money from book deals with Penguin Random House — about $346,000 while he was on the court, according to his disclosure forms. But Breyer’s recusals were likely due to his wife’s shares of the British company Pearson, which previously owned a stake in Random House, said Gabe Roth of the court transparency nonprofit Fix the Court. Roth said that under current rules justices need to recuse themselves if they own even a single share of stock in a company, but the obligation is less clear when it comes to book payments. “Whether a justice is required to recuse might really be a question,” said Roth, who first highlighted the potential conflicts with the book payments to Sotomayor and Gorsuch. “But if a justice has become enriched because of their work with a litigant, it doesn’t really matter whether they own a share of stock or not.” Two other justices, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson also have book contracts with divisions of Penguin Random House, but were not yet on the court when cases involving the publisher came up. Financial reports indicate that Gorsuch is planning another book, but with HarperCollins. Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University School of Law, said recusal decisions are a question of judgment without “clear demarcation.” He characterized Sotomayor’s half-dozen book titles with Penguin Random House as an “ongoing commercial relationship” that “may reasonably lead to questions about her impartiality.” The impartiality test, Gillers added, does not imply that a judge acted improperly, but is focused on “preserving public confidence in the courts avoiding public suspicion.” Liz Goodwin, Leigh Ann Caldwell and Amy B Wang contributed to this report."},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&w=1200"}}</script><link rel="canonical" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/04/clarence-thomas-tuition-harlan-crow/"/><link hreflang="en" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com"/><link rel="preload" as="image" imagesrcset="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKOZSYHFJJB5JJWZZBWPOFTM6E.jpg&amp;w=1200 1200w" imagesizes="(max-width: 440px) 440px,(max-width: 600px) 691px,(max-width: 768px) 691px,(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1023px) 960px,(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1299px) 530px,(min-width: 1300px) and (max-width: 1439px) 691px,(min-width: 1440px) 916px,440px"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/PostoniWide-Bold.woff2"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/ITC_Franklin-Bold.woff2"/><link rel="preload" as="font" crossorigin="crossorigin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/assets/fonts/ITC_Franklin-Light.woff2"/><script>window.wpAdFusion = {"author":["Ann Marimow","John Wagner","Robert Barnes"],"commercialNode":"/politics/courts_law","contentType":"article","domain":"https://web.archive.org/web/20230504225046/https://www.washingtonpost.com","firstPubDate":"2023-05-04T12:33:20.314Z","keywords":[],"pageId":"NHBDGV5RXJGANPOA7ZV44OLL6A","clavis":{"auxiliaries":["rcisc","r1zb8","r66hu","r5zn0","rnfyo","rddr6","rdisi","rqlce","ryiid","rjba6","r63ky","rq0bc","r1djc","rj98c","riv2l","rp6mz","rfrmj","r6x7c","r2lez","r0yv2","rvt6h","rqy2y","rcvrb","rpkxx","rohf5","reest","rqqn2","rqltv","ra4e3","ru0hj","rk4hi","riure","r2x7m","rjls7","rpsbt","rnryg","rihsc","rh065","rojxy","ry4ek","rq6iz","r4fvv","r30iy","rw76f","r6iq7","rh22v","rhwg4","rc28c","r82mu","rl43b","ru1jm","r6jbe","ryx8n","rkgjf","r1yqm","raw34","r6g4r","rbojd","r8euu","r03o4","rjl3v","rvqcm","r0tke","r02mg","rzd33","rvy90","rtdlb","rjuyh","rzfmu","r35ap","r23bw","rloxr","rz25l","r3hdp","rynal","rx4px","rmoni","rrytf","r7d9r","rl7yb","rsmxd","rt5dp","r7tmu","rzqdp","r82ip","r3t9e","rva7x","rw037","rdj51","r82zg","r3bxp","r8ehi","rge9m","rtn86","rfhup","r5fpb","rfbpa","rsjjy","rhfzk","rqs5o","r4t4y","r35lh","rr25v","rxvz3","rfpua","rj2ns","rfz4c","rq574","rd7v3","r2qxu","raoi5","rh5xk","rmit6","ra7me","r1fne","rayex","ratb5","r5hej","rhll0","rnfuc","rd270","ry25b","rg5cq","rx8m9","r4vlh","rlo0w","ridxr","rd18m","r2hzw","ropxb","rwlm1","aufsu","abxfo","agfip","aevqh","af191","arqtz","aplvt","a7a97","aodep","a7uxb","a311u","aewws","ah0cm"],"auxiliary_names":["Client List: Becton Dickinson KWs - EXCLUDES ALL","CLIENT LIST: Nomura KWs 2021 - EXCLUDES ALL","Client List: Johnson & Johnson KWs - EXCLUDES ALL","Tito's KW List - EXCLUDES ALL","Bed Bath & Beyond KWs - INCLUDE ANY","Client List: USAA KWs - EXCLUDES ALL","Client List: T.

	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.
