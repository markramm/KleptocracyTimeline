President Trump filed a federal lawsuit to block a House Oversight Committee subpoena seeking eight years of his financial records from accounting firm Mazars USA, challenging Congress's investigative authority. The lawsuit sought to prevent the release of tax returns and financial statements, arguing that the committee's request lacked legitimate legislative purpose. This legal action was part of a broader conflict between the Trump administration and congressional oversight efforts, ultimately leading to a landmark Supreme Court case that would address the limits of congressional subpoena power.
