Vladimir Putin orchestrated the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, gaining control over strategic Black Sea naval bases and significant energy resources. This action involved the deployment of unmarked Russian forces, a disputed referendum, and the subsequent integration of Crimean assets into Russian state control. The annexation provided Putin's regime with access to Crimean gas reserves, naval infrastructure, and tourism assets worth billions of dollars. International sanctions followed, but Putin's inner circle maintained control over the newly acquired territories and their economic resources.
