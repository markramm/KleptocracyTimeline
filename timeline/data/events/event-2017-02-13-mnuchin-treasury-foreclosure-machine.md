Bank executed over 36,000 foreclosures under his leadership, accounting for 39% of all reverse mortgage foreclosures post-housing collapse. Engaged in robo-signing, document fraud, and predatory practices including foreclosing on 90-year-old woman over 27-cent error. California AG memo documented "widespread misconduct" including backdating documents and failing to provide adequate foreclosure notice.
