    "summary": "In April 1982, three Yale Law School alumni – Steven Calabresi, David McIntosh, and Lee Liberman Otis – founded the Federalist Society at a pivotal moment in conservative legal thought. Their inaugural conference, funded by the Institute for Educational Affairs and John M. Olin Foundation, featured prominent conservative legal scholars like Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia, establishing a systematic approach to reshaping the American judicial landscape.\n\nKey Founding Characteristics:\n- First conference held at Yale Law School\n- Explicit goal of challenging perceived liberal legal ideology\n- Deliberate strategy of building a conservative legal talent pipeline\n- Initial funding from conservative philanthropic foundations\n\nBy 2024, the organization had become a powerful institutional infrastructure, with six Supreme Court justices identified as Federalist Society members, demonstrating its unprecedented influence on judicial appointments and constitutional interpretation.\n\nThe Federalist Society represents a landmark example of systematic institutional capture through strategic network building, legal education, and judicial recruitment.",
