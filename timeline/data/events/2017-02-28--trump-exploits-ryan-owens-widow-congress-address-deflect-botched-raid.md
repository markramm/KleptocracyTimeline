During his first address to Congress on February 28, 2017, President Trump orchestrated an emotional moment honoring Carryn Owens, widow of Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens who died in the botched Yemen raid Trump approved on January 29. The chamber gave a standing ovation lasting 1 minute and 38 seconds—the longest of the night—as Carryn Owens wept in the gallery. Trump then grotesquely joked that Ryan Owens "just broke a record" in reference to the applause duration.

Trump used the moment to deflect from responsibility for the disastrous raid that killed Ryan Owens, at least 23 civilians including children, and an 8-year-old American girl (Nawar al-Awlaki). Trump quoted Defense Secretary James Mattis claiming the operation was "highly successful" and generated "vital intelligence"—claims contradicted by military officials who told NBC News the raid "bore no significant intelligence." The New York Times reported the operation suffered "significant problems" during execution.

Ryan Owens' father, William Owens, boycotted the event and publicly rebuked Trump for "hiding behind [his] son's death." William had refused to meet Trump at Dover Air Force Base when Ryan's body was returned and demanded a congressional investigation into the raid. When questioned about the raid's failure, Trump abdicated responsibility, stating military generals "came to see me" and "they lost Ryan"—blaming subordinates for a mission he personally approved.

The cynical spectacle demonstrated Trump's willingness to exploit military sacrifice for political gain while evading accountability for his own decision-making. Trump approved the raid reportedly "over dinner" without adequate preparation or situational awareness, resulting in the first combat death on his watch, then used the widow's grief as a prop to manufacture a "presidential moment" and distract from his catastrophic judgment.

The emotional manipulation worked: media coverage focused on Carryn Owens' tears and the "moving tribute" rather than Trump's responsibility for approving an operation that killed her husband and produced no meaningful intelligence value.
