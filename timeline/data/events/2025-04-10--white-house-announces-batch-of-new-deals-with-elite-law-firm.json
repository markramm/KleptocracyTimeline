  "title": "Trump White House Brokers Pro Bono Deals with Elite Law Firms",
  "summary": "The Trump White House negotiated deals with top law firms—including Latham & Watkins, Simpson Thacher, Kirkland & Ellis, and A&O Shearman—to provide approximately $500 million in pro bono legal work. In exchange, these firms would avoid potential sanctions targeting organizations with DEI programs or perceived ties to Trump's political opponents. The agreements involve firms providing free legal services in trade negotiations and administration priorities, effectively using legal representation as a form of political leverage.",
  "description": "President Trump's administration leveraged executive power to secure pro bono legal services from major law firms by offering protection from potential government sanctions. Firms like Paul Weiss and Skadden agreed to provide millions in free legal work, with some deals reaching $100 million, in exchange for avoiding punitive executive orders.",
