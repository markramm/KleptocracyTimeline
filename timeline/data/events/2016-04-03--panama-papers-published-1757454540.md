The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published the Panama Papers on April 3, 2016, revealing a massive leak of 11.5 million financial and legal records. The documents exposed offshore financial activities of world leaders, politicians, and celebrities, detailing how Mossack Fonseca helped clients launder money, dodge sanctions, and evade taxes. Over 370 journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries collaborated to analyze and publish the findings, creating an unprecedented global investigative journalism effort.
