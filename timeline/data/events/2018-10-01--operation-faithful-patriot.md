title: Operation Faithful Patriot deploys 5,200 active-duty troops to border
---

Trump ordered 5,200 active-duty troops to border with additional 7,000 on 24-hour deployment notice. Politically charged name dropped after two weeks, reverting to "border support" after criticism. Deployment occurred just before midterm elections, with potential scale of up to 15,000 troops, matching the size of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan at the time.
