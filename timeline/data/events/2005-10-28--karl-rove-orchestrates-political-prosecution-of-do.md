The Justice Department indicted Alabama Democratic Governor Don Siegelman on federal bribery charges in what experts consider a politically motivated prosecution orchestrated by Karl Rove. Republican whistleblower Jill Simpson testified under oath that Rove directed the targeting of Siegelman, asking her to find compromising information and contacting DOJ's Public Integrity Section. The case centered on allegations Siegelman appointed HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy to a regulatory board in exchange for 00,000 to an education lottery foundation. Lead prosecutor Leura Canary was married to William Canary, Alabama's top Republican operative and close Rove associate. Despite recusing herself, evidence suggests she continued influencing the prosecution. Simpson testified Republicans 'shopped' for Judge Mark Fuller who 'hated' Siegelman. The 60 Minutes investigation revealed prosecutors coached their key witness over 70 times and withheld witness notes from the defense. Fuller violated standard procedure by sending Siegelman directly to prison without the usual 45-day reporting period. Fifty-two former state attorneys general from both parties requested Congressional investigation, calling the case a threat to prosecutorial fairness and due process.
