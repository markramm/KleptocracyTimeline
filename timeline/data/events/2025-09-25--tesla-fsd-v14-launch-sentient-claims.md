On September 25, 2025, Elon Musk announced that Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised (FSD) v14 would enter 'early wide release' the following week, marking the first major update to the driver assistance system in a year. Musk made extraordinary claims that by version 14.2, the system would feel 'almost like it is sentient being,' language that significantly overstates the capabilities of what remains a Level 2 driver assistance system requiring constant human supervision. Version 14 features a tenfold increase in parameter count in its neural networks and introduces new speed profiles including 'MAD MAX' mode with more aggressive lane changes. The deployment of this technology with exaggerated capability claims raises serious safety concerns, particularly as Tesla faces ongoing federal investigations into crashes involving FSD. The 'sentient' framing misleads consumers about the system's actual limitations and creates dangerous overreliance on automation that still requires full human attention.
