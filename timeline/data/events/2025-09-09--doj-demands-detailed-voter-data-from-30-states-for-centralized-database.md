The Department of Justice is demanding comprehensive voter roll data from over 30 states, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and voting histories, claiming the intent is to identify noncitizen voters despite minimal evidence of such fraud. The data collection effort aims to create a centralized national voter database under DOJ control, unprecedented in American election administration. State election officials have expressed alarm that the database could be weaponized for voter intimidation, selective prosecution, or to challenge legitimate voter registrations before the 2026 midterm elections. Combined with parallel efforts to gut DOJ voting rights enforcement, deploy National Guard to polling places, and push restrictive voter ID requirements, this represents a comprehensive federal takeover of election infrastructure designed to suppress opposition voting and enable fraud allegations to justify rejecting unfavorable election results.
