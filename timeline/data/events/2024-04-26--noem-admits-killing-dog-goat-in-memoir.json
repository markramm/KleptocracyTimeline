  "summary": "In her memoir \"No Going Back,\" Kristi Noem wrote about shooting her 14-month-old dog Cricket and a goat on her ranch 20 years ago. She described Cricket as \"untrainable\" after the dog attacked chickens and attempted to bite her. She then shot a goat because it smelled bad and knocked down her children. Noem defended the killings as examples of making tough leadership decisions, severely damaging her VP prospects.",
