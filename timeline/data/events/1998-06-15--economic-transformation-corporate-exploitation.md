title: Corporate Exploitation of Asian Financial Crisis Structural Adjustment
---

In June 1998, multinational financial institutions and international organizations systematically exploited the Asian Financial Crisis through coordinated structural adjustment policies. The IMF and World Bank engineered $100 billion in support packages that effectively restructured Asian economies, enabling Western corporations to acquire strategic assets at deeply discounted prices. Key interventions included mandatory financial sector reforms, currency devaluations, and governance restructuring that prioritized foreign corporate interests over local economic sovereignty.

The crisis exposed how international financial institutions could leverage economic vulnerabilities to impose neoliberal economic models, with the IMF providing $36 billion to Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand while mandating comprehensive economic transformations. These policies resulted in the strategic dismantling of local economic infrastructures, creating opportunities for Western financial institutions to acquire critical economic assets at minimal costs.
