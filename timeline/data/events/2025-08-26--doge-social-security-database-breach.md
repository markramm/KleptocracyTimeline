Social Security Administration Chief Data Officer Charles Borges filed a whistleblower complaint revealing that members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) uploaded a live copy of the entire Social Security database to a vulnerable Amazon-hosted cloud server in June 2025. The Numerical Identification System contains over 450 million records with sensitive personal information including names, places of birth, citizenship status, and Social Security numbers of applicants and their family members. An official SSA security assessment classified the transfer as 'high-risk' and warned of 'catastrophic impact' to Social Security beneficiaries if breached, estimating a 35-65% likelihood of data breach with catastrophic adverse effects. The server allegedly lacked independent security controls for monitoring who accessed the data and how it was used. Top SSA officials approved the decision despite security risks. Borges' resignation email mysteriously disappeared from recipient inboxes within 30 minutes after filing the complaint, suggesting potential evidence destruction.
