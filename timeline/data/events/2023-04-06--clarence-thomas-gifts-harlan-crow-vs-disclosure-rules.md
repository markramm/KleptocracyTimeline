ProPublica documented years of undisclosed luxury travel and gifts for Justice Clarence Thomas
from billionaire Harlan Crow and other benefactors. In March 2023, the Judicial Conference
clarified that "personal hospitality" does not exempt disclosure of non-commercial transportation
(e.g., private jets) and hospitality paid by entities. Thomas later amended disclosures acknowledging
omissions; federal courts declined referral for prosecution while citing prior staff guidance ambiguity.
