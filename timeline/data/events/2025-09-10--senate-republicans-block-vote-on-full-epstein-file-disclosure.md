Senate Republicans voted 51-49 to block Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's effort to force a vote requiring full release of Jeffrey Epstein's files, with only Senators Josh Hawley and Rand Paul breaking ranks. The vote prevents Congressional action on releasing Treasury Department suspicious activity reports, flight logs, client lists, and other documents detailing Epstein's trafficking network and financial transactions worth over $1.5 billion. The near-unanimous Republican opposition to disclosure suggests coordinated protection of individuals connected to Epstein, potentially including current or former Republican officials, donors, or Trump associates. Democrats have demanded the information through multiple channels—Senate Finance Committee requests, proposed legislation, and floor votes—but face systematic obstruction. This represents one of the starkest examples of elite impunity, where Congress refuses to investigate a massive sex trafficking operation that involved numerous powerful figures.
