Vice President-elect JD Vance wrote the foreword to "Dawn's Early Light" by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, a key architect of Project 2025. Originally scheduled for September 2024 but postponed until after the presidential election, the book describes a vision for a "peaceful 'Second American Revolution'". In the foreword, Vance uses metaphorical language about "circling wagons and loading muskets", endorsing the project's aggressive plan to transform government institutions. The book identifies conservative targets for institutional overhaul, including Ivy League colleges, the FBI, and the Department of Education, proposing to dismantle and rebuild these agencies. This demonstrates a coordinated strategy for radical governmental restructuring.
