President Trump signed an executive order titled 'Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans' directing federal financial regulators to combat alleged 'debanking'—the denial or termination of financial services based on political considerations. The order requires agencies to investigate and remedy instances where banks allegedly discriminated against customers based on their political affiliations or viewpoints.

The executive order represents an unprecedented expansion of presidential authority into banking regulation, mandating that federal agencies like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC prioritize political considerations in bank oversight. While framed as preventing discrimination, the order creates mechanisms for the administration to pressure financial institutions regarding their business decisions about which customers to serve.

Critics argue this order could be weaponized to force banks to maintain relationships with individuals or entities engaged in illegal activities, money laundering, or other financial crimes if those parties claim political motivation for enforcement actions. The order fundamentally reshapes the relationship between executive power and financial sector independence.
