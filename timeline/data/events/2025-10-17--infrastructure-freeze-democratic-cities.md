President Trump directed the Army Corps of Engineers to halt $11 billion in infrastructure funding across Democratic-led cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. The selective funding freeze represents weaponization of federal resources for partisan punishment rather than serving constituents based on need or merit. The action followed Trump's broader pattern of using federal authority to reward political allies and punish opponents, converting infrastructure investments into tools of political coercion. Cities frozen out of funding had projects already approved through legitimate grant processes but were targeted solely based on local leadership's political affiliation. The freeze demonstrates how Trump systematically corrupts federal programs by subordinating public welfare to partisan advantage, denying critical infrastructure improvements to millions of Americans for political retaliation.
