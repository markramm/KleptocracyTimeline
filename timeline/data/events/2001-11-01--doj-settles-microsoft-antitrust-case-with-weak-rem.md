The Department of Justice reached a settlement with Microsoft that effectively abandoned meaningful antitrust enforcement, despite a federal judge finding Microsoft guilty of monopolistic practices. The Bush administration's DOJ retreated from the Clinton administration's plan to break up Microsoft, instead accepting a settlement that required only minor behavioral changes and monitoring. This marked a critical turning point in antitrust enforcement, establishing the precedent that tech monopolies could avoid structural remedies through political influence and regulatory capture.

Key settlement provisions included:
- Disclosure of middleware and server interfaces
- Allowing computer manufacturers to install competing middleware
- Prohibiting Microsoft from retaliating against manufacturers/developers
- Mandating uniform licensing terms for 5 years
- Banning exclusive software development agreements

Nine states and the District of Columbia opposed the settlement, arguing it did not sufficiently address Microsoft's anti-competitive business practices. The settlement set a dangerous precedent of weak regulatory enforcement in the tech sector, demonstrating how corporate political influence could neutralize antitrust actions.
