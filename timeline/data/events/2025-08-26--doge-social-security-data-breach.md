Chief Data Officer Charles Borges exposed a critical national security vulnerability involving an unauthorized copy of the entire NUMIDENT Social Security database. Senior DOGE-affiliated officials uploaded a live copy of sensitive personal information for over 450 million Americans to an unsecured cloud environment, potentially compromising the personal data of hundreds of millions.

Key Details:
- NUMIDENT database contains comprehensive personal identifiers: Social Security numbers, names, birthdates, citizenship data, and family details
- Database copy made in June 2025 without proper security protocols
- Whistleblower complaint filed through Government Accountability Project
- Cloud environment lacks independent security monitoring
- Potential 'catastrophic impact' if database is compromised

Significance: Represents a profound systemic risk in government data management, highlighting institutional capture mechanisms and the dangers of creating new government departments with insufficient oversight and cybersecurity protocols.
