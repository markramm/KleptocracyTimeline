notes: 'Obama stated: ''Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that
  I believe will open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations
  – to spend without limit in our elections.'' This unprecedented direct criticism
  of the Court during the State of the Union created a rare constitutional moment
  highlighting the tension between democratic accountability and judicial independence.'
