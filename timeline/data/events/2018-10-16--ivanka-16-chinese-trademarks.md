Chinese government approved 16 trademarks for Ivanka Trump's fashion business in October 2018 while she served as White House senior advisor during U.S.-China trade negotiations. Approvals included rare categories like voting machines. Earlier in April 2017, China approved 3 trademarks the same day she dined with President Xi at Mar-a-Lago. Additional approvals came days before Trump announced support for lifting ZTE ban. CREW documented 3,403 conflicts of interest during her government service.
