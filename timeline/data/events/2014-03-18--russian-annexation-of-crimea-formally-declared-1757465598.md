President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty formally incorporating Crimea into the Russian Federation on March 18, 2014, following a disputed referendum held under Russian military occupation. The annexation, which involved unmarked armed forces seizing key infrastructure and a controversial referendum on March 16, was condemned by the international community. Putin argued he was protecting ethnic Russians and responding to the 'will of the Crimean people', while Western nations viewed it as a violation of international law, resulting in economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation.
