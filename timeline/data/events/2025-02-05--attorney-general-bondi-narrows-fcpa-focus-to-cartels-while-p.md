title: Attorney General Bondi Narrows FCPA Focus to Cartels While Pausing Corporate
  Bribery Cases
description: The memorandum came five days before Trump's executive order suspending
  FCPA enforcement for 180 days. The order stated FCPA has been "abused in a manner
  that harms the interests of the United States" and that enforcement against American
  companies for "routine business practices" actively harms American economic competitiveness.
  The pause allows U.S. companies to engage in foreign bribery without consequences,
  particularly in strategic sectors, while DOJ reviews all existing FCPA investigations
  with mandate to "restore proper bounds" on enforcement.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi issued a memorandum and President Trump signed an executive order directing the Department of Justice to pause FCPA enforcement for 180 days, prioritizing cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations while reviewing existing investigations. The pause allows U.S. companies temporary immunity from foreign bribery prosecutions, fundamentally altering the DOJ's approach to corporate anti-corruption enforcement.
