On February 15, 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the immediate closure of the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and KleptoCapture Task Force, representing a fundamental shift in DOJ enforcement priorities. The decision redirects resources from tracking international corruption and election interference to targeting drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations. This move effectively dismantles a decade-long effort to recover billions of dollars from corrupt overseas officials and track foreign influence in the United States.
