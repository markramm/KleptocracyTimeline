The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy established a sophisticated democratic system centuries before the United States Constitution, featuring consensus-based governance, sophisticated separation of powers, personal rights protections, and significant roles for women in political leadership. Benjamin Franklin and other Founding Fathers explicitly studied and acknowledged the Confederacy's political innovations, which directly influenced constitutional design principles.

Scholarly research highlights specific democratic features predating European models: separation of military and civil leadership, protection of individual freedoms including religious liberty, democratic processes like referendums and recalls, and meaningful political participation for women.
