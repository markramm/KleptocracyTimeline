The U.S. Department of Defense formally accepted a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, potentially violating the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause. Despite legal and ethical concerns raised by experts, the Trump administration claims the jet is a gift to the U.S. government, though critics argue it directly benefits Trump personally.
