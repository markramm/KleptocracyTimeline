  statement by Shapiro rather than formal filings. Consider supplementing with

  any available corporate records for ownership history.

Ben Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing launched The Daily Wire in September 2015.
Multiple outlets have reported that Texas billionaire Farris Wilks provided
significant seed funding (commonly cited at ~$4.7 million). The company has
not publicly released detailed ownership structure; public reporting indicates
ongoing Wilks involvement in conservative media funding.
