title: SEC Declares Meme Coins Not Subject to Securities Regulations
description: In a landmark staff statement, the SEC stated that meme coins 'typically
  have limited or no use or functionality' and are more akin to collectibles than
  financial securities. This determination means transactions involving meme coins
  do not require registration under federal securities laws, though fraudulent activities
  remain subject to enforcement.
