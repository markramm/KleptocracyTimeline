In a landmark case of regulatory capture, Dr. Curtis Wright IV, leading the FDA's Division of Anesthetic, Critical Care, and Addiction Drug Products, approved OxyContin with controversial language that misrepresented the drug's addictive potential. Wright held private meetings with Purdue Pharma representatives in January 1995, allowing the company to draft portions of his medical review.

Key Findings:
- Wright approved a label claiming delayed absorption reduces drug abuse liability
- No scientific evidence supported this claim
- Wright left FDA in October 1997
- Joined Purdue Pharma in December 1998 with a salary triple his previous government pay

Implications:
- Systematic manipulation of drug approval process
- Fundamental breakdown of regulatory oversight
- Contributed to nationwide opioid crisis
- Resulted in nearly 645,000 overdose deaths from 1999-2021
