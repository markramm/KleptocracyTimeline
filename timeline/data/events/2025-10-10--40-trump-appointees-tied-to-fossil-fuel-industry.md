Public Citizen and Revolving Door Project analysis identified more than 40 Trump appointees with direct fossil fuel industry ties, plus 100+ more with related interests distributed across federal agencies. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum exemplify this systematic industry capture of regulatory and policy positions. The pervasive placement of fossil fuel industry operatives throughout the federal government demonstrates complete regulatory capture, where agencies meant to oversee and regulate energy companies are instead staffed and directed by industry insiders advancing corporate interests over public welfare.
