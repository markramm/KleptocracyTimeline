title: McKinsey Strategizes Corporate Capture in Asian Markets During Financial Crisis
---

McKinsey & Company plays a pivotal strategic role during the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis, positioning itself as a key restructuring advisor to multinational corporations and government entities. The firm's 'Productivity-led Growth for Korea' report provides a comprehensive blueprint for economic transformation, highlighting institutional inefficiencies and recommending aggressive corporate and banking sector reforms. McKinsey's recommendations align closely with IMF and World Bank restructuring strategies, facilitating rapid economic reconfiguration that prioritizes foreign corporate interests.
