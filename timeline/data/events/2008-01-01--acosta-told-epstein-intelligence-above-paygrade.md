notes: Treat this as a reported claim, not established fact. The quotation originates
  with Vicky Ward's Daily Beast reporting; it has been widely re-circulated but not
  officially corroborated. For context on the 2007 NPA and subsequent scrutiny of
  Acosta's decisions, see DOJ OPR's 2020 report and the Miami Herald's 'Perversion
  of Justice' series.

Investigative reporter Vicky Ward wrote in 2019 that, during Donald Trump's transition vetting, Alexander Acosta explained he had been told to 'back off' because Jeffrey Epstein 'belonged to intelligence.' No U.S. government review has substantiated intelligence ties; DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility later criticized the 2007 non-prosecution agreement on other grounds without noting any intelligence issues.
