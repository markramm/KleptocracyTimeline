President Trump is seeking $230 million in taxpayer funds from the Justice Department as 'compensation' for past federal investigations into his conduct. The payout would be approved by former Trump defense lawyers now occupying senior DOJ positions, creating severe ethical conflicts where Trump's personal attorneys would authorize payments to their former client using public funds. The unprecedented demand treats federal criminal investigations as tortious acts requiring compensation, fundamentally mischaracterizing lawful law enforcement as personal injury. The arrangement demonstrates complete collapse of institutional independence, with DOJ converted into a vehicle for Trump's personal enrichment and retribution. If approved, the payment would establish a precedent where presidents can extract taxpayer money as 'compensation' for being investigated, incentivizing future abuse and corruption.
