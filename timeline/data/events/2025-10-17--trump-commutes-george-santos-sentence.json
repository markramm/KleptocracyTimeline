  "title": "Trump Commutes George Santos Prison Sentence After 3 Months",
  "summary": "President Trump commuted the 87-month federal prison sentence of former Rep. George Santos (R-NY) after Santos served only three months of his sentence. Santos pleaded guilty in August 2024 to multiple counts of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, campaign finance violations, and financial crimes including stealing donor money and lying to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe commutation came despite Santos's admission of guilt to serious financial crimes and represents a pattern of Trump using executive clemency to benefit political allies. Santos was expelled from Congress in December 2023 and sentenced in April 2025, yet received presidential clemency less than six months into his 87-month sentence.\n\nThis action exemplifies the systematic abuse of presidential pardon power to shield political allies from accountability, undermining the rule of law and sending a message that proximity to Trump provides immunity from consequences for federal crimes. The speed and timing of the commutation—while Santos was still serving his sentence—demonstrates how executive clemency has been transformed from a mechanism of justice into a tool of political patronage.",
