The Trump administration's government shutdown reached its 36th day on November 5, 2025, officially surpassing the previous record of 35 days set during the December 2018-January 2019 shutdown under Trump's first term. Over 1 million federal employees continued working without paychecks, while approximately 600,000 remained furloughed. Though a 2019 law guarantees backpay after shutdown resolution, President Trump's recent comments left many workers worried about whether that commitment would be honored.

The Senate failed for the 14th time to pass a House-approved stopgap funding bill, despite Republicans controlling both chambers. The GOP's attempt to temporarily resume federal funding at current levels stalled because Democrats demanded any appropriations package contain additional spending on health care and other priorities, particularly the extension of expiring ACA subsidies. Republicans needed 60 Senate votes to overcome the filibuster, giving Democrats leverage Trump refused to negotiate. Trump rejected compromise, stating: "I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats," and called on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster—a request they declined.

Service disruptions cascaded across federal agencies: the FAA announced plans to cut air traffic by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday due to staffing shortages; national parks reduced operations and Smithsonian museums remained closed; the IRS furloughed nearly half its staff, delaying taxpayer services; the Head Start program threatened to cut access for tens of thousands of children; and SNAP benefits halted, with restoration "delayed and may only be for half the amount people typically get." Air traffic control shortages caused nationwide delays, with controllers working without pay threatening the safety of the national aviation system.

The record-breaking shutdown exemplified Trump's willingness to inflict widespread suffering on federal workers and the American public to advance his political objectives. By refusing to negotiate and demanding Senate Republicans eliminate the filibuster—a fundamental protection against simple majority rule—Trump demonstrated his authoritarian approach to governance. The shutdown weaponized federal operations as political leverage, with millions of Americans experiencing service disruptions while over 1.6 million federal workers faced financial hardship. Trump's comment questioning whether backpay would be honored violated the 2019 law and created additional uncertainty for workers already facing mortgage payments, childcare costs, and other obligations without income.
