notes: Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2020. After $450M in Spotify deals and growing
  conservative alignment, he shifted right. With 14.5M listeners per episode, his
  endorsement became a key component of Trump's young male voter strategy. Podcasts
  emerge as a critical political communication platform in 2024.
