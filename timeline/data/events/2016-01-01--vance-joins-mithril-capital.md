notes: Vance's hiring at Mithril Capital represents classic patronage system where
  ideologically aligned individuals are given wealth-building opportunities in exchange
  for future political service. The position transforms Vance from working-class author
  to Silicon Valley insider, providing him with elite credentials and financial resources
  necessary for political campaigns. This mirrors Thiel's broader strategy of creating
  alternative elite networks loyal to his anti-democratic vision.
