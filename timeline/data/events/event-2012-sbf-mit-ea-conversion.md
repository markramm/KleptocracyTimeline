MIT physics major Sam Bankman-Fried recruited into Effective Altruism movement through talk by philosopher William MacAskill. Pivotal lunch meeting convinces SBF to pursue "earning to give" strategy - working in finance to accumulate wealth for charitable donations rather than direct service. This academic capture moment establishes ideological framework that later enables systematic regulatory and institutional manipulation. EA philosophy provides intellectual cover for wealth extraction by reframing profit maximization as altruistic imperative.
