  timing raised concerns about quid pro quo arrangements, with the crypto purchase
  occurring immediately before DOJ dismantled its crypto fraud investigation unit.
  DT Marks DEFI LLC, linked to the Trump family, has rights to 75% of revenues from

Trump's World Liberty Financial sold $25 million worth of tokens to Dubai-based DWF Labs on April 4, 2025, just three days before Trump's Justice Department announced disbanding of team that previously investigated crypto fraud cases. The Trump family holds 60% stake in World Liberty Financial and has earned approximately $500 million from the crypto platform. DWF Labs, previously accused of market manipulation, provided liquidity for World Liberty's upcoming USD1 stablecoin.
