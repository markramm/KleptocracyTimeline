A senior DOJ official in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office directed prosecutors to prepare investigations into George Soros's Open Society Foundations, exploring potential charges including material support to terrorism, arson, wire fraud, and racketeering. The directive followed Trump's public demands that Soros 'should be investigated for racketeering' and was based on a conservative watchdog group report alleging $80 million in grants to 'pro-terror groups.' Open Society Foundations unequivocally denied funding terrorism, calling the investigation 'politically motivated attacks on civil society' conducted 'without evidence.' This represents weaponization of federal law enforcement to target the president's political enemies through baseless terrorism investigations, creating a chilling effect on philanthropic support for civil rights, democracy, and social justice causes.
