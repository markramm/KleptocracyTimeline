On August 23, 1971, Lewis F. Powell Jr. delivered his confidential memorandum 'Attack on American Free Enterprise System' to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, providing a strategic blueprint for corporate political mobilization. The 34-page document outlined a comprehensive strategy for businesses to systematically defend against perceived anti-corporate sentiment through 'careful long-range planning,' coordinated financing, and the creation of intellectual infrastructure. Powell emphasized the need for 'highly qualified scholars' and organizations with 'national reputation' to counter what he saw as threats to the free enterprise system. This memorandum directly inspired the creation of conservative think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation, and became the foundational document for the modern conservative movement's institutional strategy. The memo led to dramatic business mobilization: corporate PACs increased from under 300 in 1976 to over 1,200 by 1980, and corporations with Washington public affairs offices grew from 100 in 1968 to over 500 in 1978.
