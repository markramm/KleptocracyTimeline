Robert F. Kennedy Jr. falsely claimed COVID-19 was a bioweapon potentially designed by China to target specific racial groups, stating it disproportionately harmed Caucasians and Black people while Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people were immune due to the virus's genetic structure. These scientifically baseless claims echoed antisemitic and racist conspiracy theories.
