Senior Exxon scientist James Black delivered a sobering message to company executives about carbon dioxide warming the planet, marking the beginning of documented internal knowledge at Exxon about climate change risks. Internal research from 1977-1982 created remarkably accurate climate models predicting global temperature increases from fossil fuel emissions. A Harvard study found that 63-83% of ExxonMobil's internal climate projections were scientifically accurate, with precise predictions of global temperature increases caused by CO2 emissions. A 1982 internal report to Exxon management stated that consequences could be "catastrophic" and that significant fossil fuel consumption reductions would be necessary.
