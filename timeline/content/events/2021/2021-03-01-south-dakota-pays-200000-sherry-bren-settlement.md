Sherry Bren, the 70-year-old head of South Dakota's appraiser certification program, was forced to retire after refusing to approve Governor Noem's daughter's license. Bren filed an age discrimination complaint and received a $200,000 settlement to withdraw it. She testified she felt "intimidated" during the meeting at the governor's mansion.
