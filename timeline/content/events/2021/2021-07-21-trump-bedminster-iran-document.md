Audio recording captured Trump showing classified documents about U.S. attack plans on Iran
to people without security clearances at his Bedminster golf club. Trump stated: "As
president I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret."
This admission proved Trump knew he retained classified material and lacked power to
declassify it after leaving office, becoming key evidence in Jack Smith's prosecution.
