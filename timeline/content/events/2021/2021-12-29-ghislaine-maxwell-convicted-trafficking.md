Ghislaine Maxwell is convicted on five of six federal charges including sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy, in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse network. The trial revealed extensive details about the systematic recruitment and abuse of minors, but many documents and witness testimonies remained sealed or redacted, limiting public understanding of the full scope of institutional connections.
