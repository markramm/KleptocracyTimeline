Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny released a comprehensive investigation exposing a $1.35 billion palace complex allegedly owned by Vladimir Putin on the Black Sea. The investigation, titled 'Putin's Palace: History of World's Largest Bribe,' revealed a 17,691 square meter palace on a 7,000 hectare estate, 39 times larger than Monaco. Using drone footage, satellite imagery, and insider testimony, Navalny documented a massive corruption scheme involving Putin's inner circle, including oligarchs Arkady Rotenberg, Boris Rotenberg, and Gennady Timchenko. The investigation implicated state-owned companies like Transneft and Rosneft in funding the project. Within days, the video gained over 100 million views, sparking widespread protests across Russia and drawing international attention to high-level corruption.
