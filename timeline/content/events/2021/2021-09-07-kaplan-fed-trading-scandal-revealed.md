Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan resigned on September 27, 2021, after disclosure of extensive stock trading during the 2020 pandemic. Kaplan had made multiple trades worth over $1 million in companies like Amazon, Apple, and Delta Air Lines while serving as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. Though later cleared of legal wrongdoing, the trades raised significant ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest during a period of unprecedented federal market intervention. His resignation was part of a broader controversy involving Fed officials' trading activities, which prompted Fed Chair Jerome Powell to pledge a review and tightening of trading rules for federal officials.
