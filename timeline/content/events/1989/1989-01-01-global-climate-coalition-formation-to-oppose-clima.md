The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed as a project of the National Association of Manufacturers to represent fossil fuel producers and oppose regulation to mitigate global warming. Founding members included major oil companies like Phillips Petroleum, Shell, Texaco, Amoco, trade associations such as the American Petroleum Institute, and utilities like American Electric Power. The coalition strategically challenged emerging climate science and aimed to delay or prevent carbon emissions regulations through coordinated industry efforts.
