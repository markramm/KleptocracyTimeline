Air Force Lt. Colonel and NSA intelligence officer Karen Kwiatkowski, assigned to the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans, documents systematic intelligence corruption coordinated between OSP and the White House Iraq Group before retiring to become a whistleblower. Kwiatkowski testified to Congress that OSP functioned as 'a propaganda shop' where 'intelligence was being cooked' to support predetermined policy conclusions for WHIG dissemination. She documented how Douglas Feith's OSP deliberately bypassed CIA intelligence analysis to feed fabricated intelligence directly to Karl Rove's WHIG coordination meetings. Kwiatkowski revealed that OSP officials including Michael Maloof and David Wurmser met regularly with Vice President Cheney's staff and WHIG coordinators to ensure that manipulated intelligence reached senior policymakers without CIA interference. Her whistleblower testimony described a 'neoconservative agenda' where 'a lot of people were being very fast and loose with the intelligence' to manufacture justifications for the Iraq invasion. Kwiatkowski's documentation revealed that the OSP-WHIG coordination created systematic institutional mechanisms for transforming speculation into authoritative-sounding intelligence reports, representing what she called 'the prostitution of intelligence' through coordinated deception between Pentagon political appointees and White House propagandists. Her testimony provided crucial insider evidence of the constitutional violations inherent in the OSP-WHIG intelligence manipulation infrastructure.
