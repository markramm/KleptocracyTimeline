President George W. Bush issues Executive Order establishing the Office of Global Communications, formalizing the systematic coordination infrastructure between the White House and television networks developed during the WHIG Iraq campaign. The OGC institutionalizes daily conference calls with administration leaders for communications planning, systematic arrangement of television network interviews for U.S. officials, and coordinated distribution of talking points to reporters worldwide. The executive order formalizes what had been informal coordination protocols, creating permanent institutional infrastructure for government-media coordination that extends beyond individual policy campaigns. The OGC's formalization represents the transformation of temporary propaganda operations into permanent government infrastructure, establishing legal framework for systematic media coordination that encompasses domestic and international outlets. The institutionalization includes formal protocols for arranging strategic television appearances, coordinated messaging campaigns, and systematic relationship management with network executives. This executive order transforms WHIG's temporary coordination mechanisms into permanent institutional apparatus, establishing legal foundation for systematic government control over media messaging. The OGC's formalization represents a constitutional crisis moment where propaganda operations transition from episodic political tactics to permanent institutional features of executive branch governance, fundamentally altering the relationship between government and independent media.
