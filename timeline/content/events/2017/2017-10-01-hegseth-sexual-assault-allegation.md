A woman alleged Pete Hegseth sexually assaulted her at a California Federation of Republican Women conference in 2017. She told police she "remembered saying 'no' a lot" and that Hegseth blocked her from leaving his hotel room and took her phone. Hegseth paid the woman $50,000 to prevent a lawsuit that could damage his Fox News career, though he maintains the encounter was consensual.
