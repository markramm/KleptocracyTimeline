The Secret Service paid at least $1.4 million directly to Trump properties during his presidency, often at rates far exceeding government limits. Trump charged the Secret Service up to $1,185 per night at Mar-a-Lago, five times the government rate of $195. Eric Trump claimed they only charged 'like 50 bucks,' but documents showed payments of $17,000 in golf cart rentals at Trump golf courses in just months. The Service paid $40,000 for rooms when Trump stayed at his Doral resort for two days. They were even charged $3 per glass of water at Mar-a-Lago. Trump visited his properties 281 times as president, generating revenue each time from government payments. This self-dealing violated the domestic emoluments clause, with Trump profiting from his constitutional duty to receive Secret Service protection. The total exceeded what Trump claimed to donate back to the Treasury, meaning he profited from taxpayers.
