The Paradise Papers, a massive leak of 13.4 million documents from offshore law firm Appleby and corporate services provider Estera, exposed how global elites used legal loopholes to avoid taxes. The investigation revealed offshore interests of over 120 politicians and world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II, Russian oligarchs, and connections to the Trump administration. The data trove, published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), included information on 290,000+ entities across 19 tax havens.
