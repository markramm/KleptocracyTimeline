On March 23, 2017, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced that its contracting
officer found the Trump Old Post Office LLC in compliance with the lease's Section 37.19
(the "no elected official" clause). In January 2019, the GSA Inspector General reported that
the agency did not meaningfully evaluate the Constitution's Emoluments Clauses when issuing
that compliance determination, recommending a legal review. Congressional oversight hearings
later probed the discrepancy.
