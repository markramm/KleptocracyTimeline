President Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, making America the only nation to reject the accord after Syria and Nicaragua joined. Trump falsely claimed the agreement would cost America $3 trillion and 6.5 million jobs while allowing China and India to increase emissions. In reality, the agreement was voluntary with self-determined targets. The withdrawal process took four years, with the exit becoming official on November 4, 2020. This decision followed intense lobbying from fossil fuel companies who donated $139 million to Trump and Republicans in 2016. CEOs of major companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla opposed withdrawal, warning it would damage American competitiveness. Military leaders called climate change a national security threat. Scientists projected the withdrawal could add 0.3°C to global warming by 2100, causing thousands of additional deaths from extreme weather. Biden rejoined on his first day in office.
