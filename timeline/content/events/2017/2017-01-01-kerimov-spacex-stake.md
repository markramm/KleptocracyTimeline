Bloomberg and other outlets reported Russian oligarch Suleyman Kerimov held approximately 1% of SpaceX through Delaware's Heritage Trust, managed by Citigroup, from 2017 until disposal before Treasury blocked the trust in 2022. The stake was acquired pre-sanctions but retained for years after 2018 U.S. sanctions.
