Reuters investigation revealed at least 63 Russian nationals invested $98.4 million in
Trump-branded properties in South Florida, primarily in Sunny Isles Beach. The buyers
purchased units at Trump Grande, Trump Towers, and Trump Hollywood, with about one-third
of all units owned through LLCs that mask true ownership. Most purchases were all-cash
transactions over $1 million each, and owners didn't declare these assets in Russia,
fitting patterns associated with money laundering though no illegality was proven.
