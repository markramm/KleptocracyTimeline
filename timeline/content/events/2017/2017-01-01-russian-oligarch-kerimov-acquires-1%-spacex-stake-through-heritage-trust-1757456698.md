Sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleyman Kerimov held a strategic 1% stake in SpaceX from 2017-2022 through Delaware's Heritage Trust, initially worth $10 million and later valued at $500 million. The investment, managed by Citigroup and structured to obscure Kerimov's ownership, raised significant national security concerns given Kerimov's status as a sanctioned Russian senator and the sensitive nature of SpaceX's government and military contracts.
