The Mueller Report documented at least 140 contacts between Trump and 18 associates with
Russian nationals and WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and transition. The report found
Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic" and violated U.S. criminal law. While
establishing "multiple links" between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mueller did not find
sufficient evidence of criminal conspiracy. None of the 140+ contacts were reported to
authorities, and the Trump team attempted to cover up every single one.
