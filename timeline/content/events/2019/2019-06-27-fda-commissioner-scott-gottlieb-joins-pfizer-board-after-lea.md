Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commissioner, joined Pfizer's board of directors on June 27, 2019, just 85 days after leaving the FDA. The move sparked significant criticism about the 'revolving door' between government regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies. Gottlieb will serve on the board's regulatory and compliance committee, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest in drug approval processes.
