U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rules that federal prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by failing to inform victims about the 2008 non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. The ruling found that prosecutors deliberately concealed the agreement from victims and their attorneys, constituting a fundamental breach of federal law requiring victim consultation.
