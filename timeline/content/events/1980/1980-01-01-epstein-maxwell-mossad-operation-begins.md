Former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe alleges that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell ran a sexual-blackmail operation potentially connected to Israeli intelligence in the 1980s–1990s. Multiple sources, including a former NSA counterspy and academic research, explore this hypothesis, though no definitive official confirmation exists. Israeli officials, including former PM Naftali Bennett, strongly deny these claims.
