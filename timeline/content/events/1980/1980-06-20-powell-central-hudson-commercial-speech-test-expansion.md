Justice Powell delivers the Supreme Court majority opinion in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, establishing the landmark four-part test for commercial speech protection under the First Amendment. The decision strikes down New York's utility advertising restrictions, creating a constitutional framework that significantly expands corporate communication rights beyond previous legal standards.
