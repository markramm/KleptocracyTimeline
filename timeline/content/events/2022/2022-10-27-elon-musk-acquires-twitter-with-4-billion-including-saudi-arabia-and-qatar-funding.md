Elon Musk completed the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc. with significant funding from Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, fundamentally altering control over a major global communication platform. Prince Alwaleed's Kingdom Holding Company contributed $1.89 billion (nearly 35 million shares), making them the second-largest investors after Musk, while Qatar Investment Authority provided $375 million. Other oligarch-connected investors included Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, with the group collectively supplying $7.1 billion in funding. Initially, Prince Alwaleed had opposed the acquisition before reversing course and rolling over his existing Twitter shares. The acquisition raised immediate concerns about foreign influence over American information infrastructure, with critics noting the contradiction between Musk's stated free speech goals and accepting financing from authoritarian regimes with poor human rights records. The deal created unprecedented oligarch control over a platform previously considered the "global town square," with Saudi Arabia gaining substantial influence over American political discourse through their investment stake. Senator Chris Murphy and other critics called for investigations into the foreign investment implications of the deal.
