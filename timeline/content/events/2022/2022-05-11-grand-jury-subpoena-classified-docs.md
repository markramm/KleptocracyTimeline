A federal grand jury issued a subpoena requiring Trump to return all documents "bearing
classification markings" in his possession. This legal demand came after the National
Archives discovered classified materials in boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Trump's
alleged failure to fully comply with this subpoena, including moving boxes to conceal
documents from his attorney's search, became central to the obstruction charges filed
against him in 2023.
