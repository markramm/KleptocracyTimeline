Trump attorney Christina Bobb signed a certification stating that all classified documents
requested by the May 11 grand jury subpoena had been returned to the government. The
attestation, drafted by Evan Corcoran, proved false when the FBI found 103 additional
classified documents during the August 8 search - more than twice what had been returned
on June 3. This false certification became key evidence in the obstruction charges against Trump.
