FBI agents executed an unprecedented search warrant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence,
recovering 33 boxes containing 11 sets of classified documents, including top secret and
sensitive compartmented information. The search followed Trump's failure to return all
classified materials after a grand jury subpoena. This was the first FBI search of a
former president's home in U.S. history.
