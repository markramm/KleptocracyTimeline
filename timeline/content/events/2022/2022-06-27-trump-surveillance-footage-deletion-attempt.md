Carlos De Oliveira told a Trump employee in Mar-a-Lago's audio closet that "the boss"
wanted the surveillance server deleted after DOJ subpoenaed footage on June 24. De Oliveira
and Walt Nauta had inspected cameras on June 25, walking through tunnels with flashlights.
This alleged deletion attempt, occurring after FBI agents visited to collect classified
documents, led to additional obstruction charges in the superseding indictment against
Trump, Nauta, and De Oliveira.
