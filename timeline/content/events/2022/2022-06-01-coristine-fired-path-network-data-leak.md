Edward Coristine, then 16, was fired from his internship at cybersecurity firm Path Network
for allegedly leaking internal company information to competitors. Path founder Marshal Webb
stated "This is unacceptable and there is zero tolerance for this." Shortly after Coristine's
termination, an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations were leaked online.
At the same time, Coristine ran DiamondCDN, which provided services to the EGodly cybercrime
group known for cryptocurrency theft and FBI agent harassment.
