The National Archives retrieved 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago containing 184 classified documents
totaling 700 pages, including 25 marked "top secret," 92 "secret," and 67 "confidential."
Documents included CIA, FBI, and NSA materials on national security topics, some marked
HCS, FISA, ORCON, NOFORN, and SI. This discovery led to a criminal referral to DOJ on
February 9, 2022, initiating the investigation that resulted in federal charges.
