Scott Bloch, Special Counsel at the Office of Special Counsel (2004-2008), systematically dismantled federal whistleblower protections by dismissing over 1,000 whistleblower disclosures without investigation. Coalition of whistleblower groups documented his 95% dismissal rate, with only 25 of 530 new cases reported to President and Congress in FY 2008. Bloch reduced total pending matters at OSC by 56% through mass dismissals without proper investigation. He reversed longstanding OSC policy protecting federal employees from sexual orientation discrimination, making elimination of these protections one of his 'highest and most immediate priorities.' When 12 OSC staff filed complaints against him for retaliation in 2005, Bloch attempted to reassign them to remote field offices. As investigations began, Bloch hired 'Geeks on Call' to perform a 'seven-level wipe' of his computers to destroy evidence, leading to obstruction of justice charges. He pleaded guilty in 2010 to criminal contempt of Congress for destroying evidence and lying under oath. His systematic suppression effectively neutered the OSC's mission to protect federal whistleblowers during critical Bush administration years.
