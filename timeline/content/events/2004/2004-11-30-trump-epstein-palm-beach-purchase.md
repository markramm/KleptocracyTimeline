Donald Trump purchased Maison de l'Amitié for $41.35 million at a November 30, 2004 bankruptcy auction, outbidding Jeffrey Epstein who went up to $38.6 million. During the auction, Epstein's attorneys tried to disqualify Trump over title insurance demands, but Judge Steven Friedman rejected the objection. The trustee described it as "two very large Palm Beach egos going at it." The loss angered Epstein and ended their 15-year friendship. Trump later sold the property to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev for $95 million in 2008.
