Accenture, leading the Smart Border Alliance, was awarded a major Department of Homeland Security contract to develop a comprehensive border management technology system. The five-year contract, valued between $10 million and $10 billion, aimed to create a 'virtual border' system using digital fingerscans and photos to track non-U.S. citizen entries and exits.
