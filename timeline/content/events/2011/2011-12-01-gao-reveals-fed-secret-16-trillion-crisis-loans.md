The first comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve revealed it secretly provided $16.1 trillion in emergency loans to major financial institutions during the 2008-2010 financial crisis, far exceeding the $700 billion TARP program. The audit exposed unprecedented scale of financial sector bailouts, including $3.08 trillion to foreign institutions, and significant conflicts of interest involving bank executives serving on the Fed's board while their institutions received massive, near-zero interest loans.
