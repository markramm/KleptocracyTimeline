Elon Musk's xAI launches Grok, an AI chatbot positioned as a 'maximum truth-seeking' alternative to existing AI assistants. Developed in just four months, Grok was introduced to a limited audience of X Premium users in November 2023. The chatbot was designed to answer 'spicy questions' rejected by other AI systems, immediately raising concerns about potential misinformation and lack of content moderation. AI safety researchers, including those from OpenAI and Anthropic, later criticized xAI's approach, highlighting risks in its unfiltered conversational AI model and lack of comprehensive safety protocols.
