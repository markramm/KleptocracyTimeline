Trump launched his third NFT collection titled 'MugShot' featuring 100,000 digital trading cards based on his Georgia election interference mugshot. Priced at $99 each, the collection generated approximately $9.9 million in initial revenue. The unique offering included pieces of Trump's actual mugshot suit for buyers purchasing 47 cards, along with a Mar-a-Lago dinner invitation. The launch notably impacted Trump's previous NFT collections, causing a 400% increase in trading volume and a 30% surge in the floor price of his first NFT series.
