Senator J.D. Vance continues to endorse Claremont Institute publications advocating for authoritarian governance approaches, part of a broader pattern of promoting right-wing ideological frameworks that challenge democratic norms. During a December 2023 speaking engagement, Vance aligned with the institute's controversial political philosophy, suggesting a deep ideological connection to their anti-democratic policy proposals.
