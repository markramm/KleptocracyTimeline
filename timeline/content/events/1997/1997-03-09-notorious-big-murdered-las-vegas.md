Christopher "Notorious B.I.G." Wallace, Bad Boy Records' biggest star, is murdered in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, six months after Tupac Shakur's similar death. The murder, which remains officially unsolved, occurs at the height of the East Coast-West Coast hip-hop rivalry that Combs allegedly helped fuel. Some investigators suggest the chaos and violence served to maintain control through fear while eliminating potential threats to Combs' empire. The pattern of using violence and chaos for control mirrors tactics used by intelligence agencies and organized crime.

Key investigation details from official sources: The FBI opened a civil rights investigation into the murder, which was closed in 2005. The case involves rare Gecko 9mm armor-piercing ammunition, which is seldom found in the U.S. Despite multiple investigations, no one has been formally charged with Wallace's murder.
