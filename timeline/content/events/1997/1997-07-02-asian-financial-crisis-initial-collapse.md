Thailand's decision to float the baht on July 2, 1997, triggered a catastrophic financial crisis across Southeast Asia. The currency collapsed from 25 baht per USD to 54 baht per USD by January 1998, causing systemic economic destabilization. The IMF and World Bank responded with a $20 billion bailout package, imposing strict structural adjustment conditions that fundamentally reshaped regional economic policies.

Key impacts included:
- Rapid capital flight from Southeast Asian markets
- Deep recessions in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines
- Significant increases in unemployment and poverty
- Fundamental reforms in financial regulation and economic policy

The crisis exposed critical vulnerabilities in emerging market economies, including poor financial supervision, unsustainable currency pegs, and over-reliance on foreign borrowing.
