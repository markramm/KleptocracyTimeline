The International Monetary Fund (IMF) begins systematic intervention in Asian economies following the Thai baht devaluation, triggering a region-wide financial crisis. This marks the start of a coordinated structural adjustment strategy that fundamentally reshaped Asian economic landscapes. The IMF provided $36 billion in support to Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand, with conditions requiring significant economic reforms, financial sector restructuring, and improved governance.
