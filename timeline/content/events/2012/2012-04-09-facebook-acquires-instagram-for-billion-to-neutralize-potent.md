Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion in a strategic move explicitly designed to neutralize a potential competitive threat. The acquisition was part of a systematic strategy to prevent emerging social media platforms from challenging Facebook's market dominance. With Instagram having 27 million registered users at the time, the deal represented a significant consolidation of social media market power.
