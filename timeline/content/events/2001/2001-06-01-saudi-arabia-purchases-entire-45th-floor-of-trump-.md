Saudi Arabia purchases the entire 45th floor of Trump World Tower for $4.5 million. The five apartments (10 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms) were later converted to part of Saudi Arabia's UN Mission in 2008, creating ongoing common charges and potential emoluments clause violations during Trump's presidency.
