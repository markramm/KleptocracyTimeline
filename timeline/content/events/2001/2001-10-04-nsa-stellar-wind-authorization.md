President George W. Bush authorized the NSA's Stellar Wind warrantless domestic surveillance program, completely bypassing FISA court oversight in a fundamental alteration of constitutional checks and balances. The program allowed the NSA to collect phone metadata and internet communications of US citizens without warrants, establishing a parallel legal framework where executive authorization alone sufficed for domestic surveillance.

The authorization came just 23 days after 9/11, with only select members of Congress briefed under extreme secrecy. NSA Director Michael Hayden later testified that the program operated under the President's Article II constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, arguing this superseded FISA requirements. Only two FISA court judges were eventually given limited briefings, fundamentally altering the judicial oversight role.

Declassified Inspector General reports later revealed significant legal concerns: the program's effectiveness was questionable, and its secrecy hampered intelligence gathering. The Senate Intelligence Committee found that the program raised substantial constitutional questions about executive surveillance powers, with Senator Ron Wyden notably challenging the program's legal basis.

Key legal justifications included claims that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) provided implicit authority for domestic surveillance and that the President's wartime powers allowed bypassing traditional judicial oversight. These arguments were later challenged by multiple legal scholars and congressional oversight committees.
