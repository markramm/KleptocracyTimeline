The Bush administration releases the National Energy Policy report developed by Cheney's Energy Task Force, containing 105 recommendations that overwhelmingly favor fossil fuel industries while giving minimal attention to renewable energy. The report recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, streamlining regulations for oil and gas development, providing $8 billion in tax breaks and subsidies to oil companies including a $2 billion subsidy for coal, and expanding nuclear energy through establishing waste repositories and streamlining plant licensing. Despite renewable energy being the stated purpose for establishing the task force, only seven of 105 recommendations reference renewable energy alternatives. The policy incorporates industry recommendations 'often word for word,' with Enron's proposals adopted in seven of eight policy areas and at least 17 policies directly benefiting Enron included verbatim. The report also contains maps of Iraqi oil fields and foreign contract analysis, suggesting broader geopolitical energy planning beyond domestic policy. This systematic translation of corporate priorities into national policy establishes a blueprint for industry capture of regulatory processes, with minimal environmental input despite claims of balanced consideration. The policy outcomes demonstrate unprecedented corporate influence over national energy strategy during a critical period for climate and environmental policy.
