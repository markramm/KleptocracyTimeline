While specific claims about Russian intelligence surveillance in 2013 could not be verified, Roger Stone's interactions with Russian-linked entities became more prominently documented during the 2016 presidential campaign. Stone had communications with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker persona believed to be operated by Russian military intelligence (GRU), and was a key figure in investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Investigations revealed his potential role in facilitating communication between the Trump campaign and Russian-sourced information.
