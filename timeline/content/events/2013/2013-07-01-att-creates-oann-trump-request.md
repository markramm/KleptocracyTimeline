Court records and testimony reported by Reuters show AT&T played a pivotal role in launching and sustaining One America News Network (OANN), at times accounting for the vast majority of its revenue via carriage deals. OANN's founder testified AT&T executives sought a conservative channel. AT&T disputes "funding" characterizations but not the carriage relationship.
