Trump signed EO to reinstate Schedule F (renamed "Schedule Policy/Career") targeting 50,000 federal employees (2% of workforce) for at-will employment status, stripping civil service protections. OPM estimates could reach 200,000+. Agencies must recommend positions by April 20. Key component of Project 2025. Allows easy firing of "policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential" positions. Biden had revoked original 2020 order and added 2024 protections.
