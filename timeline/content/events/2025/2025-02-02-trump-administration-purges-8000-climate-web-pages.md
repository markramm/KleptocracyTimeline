Within first two weeks of Trump's term, administration removed over 8,000 web pages from 12+ government websites including EPA removing "Climate Change" from homepage navigation and EJScreen environmental justice tool. NOAA climate data also targeted. 70% more changes than first Trump term, with "climate change" replaced by "climate resilience" across agencies.
