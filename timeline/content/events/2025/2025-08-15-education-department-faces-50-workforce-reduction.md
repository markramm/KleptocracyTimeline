Education Secretary Linda McMahon initiated a dramatic 50% workforce reduction at the Department of Education, laying off approximately 1,950 employees. The mass layoffs, occurring on March 11, 2025, represent the first phase of the Trump administration's plan to dismantle the department, directly implementing recommendations from Project 2025. Employees were placed on administrative leave with full pay until June 9, marking a significant transformation of federal education infrastructure.
