President Trump summarily fired 17 federal inspectors general without explanation, violating the 1978 Inspector General Act. The mass firing targeted officials investigating key areas, including Defense Department IG Robert Storch (SpaceX compliance review) and Agriculture Department IG Phyllis Fong (Neuralink investigation). The firings defied legal requirements for 30-day notice to Congress and specific justifications, representing an unprecedented assault on federal oversight mechanisms.
