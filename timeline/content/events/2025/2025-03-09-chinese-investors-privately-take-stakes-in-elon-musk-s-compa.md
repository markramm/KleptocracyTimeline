Wealthy Chinese investors have secretly used special-purpose vehicles to invest over $30 million in Elon Musk's private companies, including SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. These investments are routed through Cayman Islands-registered entities to obscure direct ownership, raising significant national security concerns given SpaceX's status as a key U.S. military contractor.
