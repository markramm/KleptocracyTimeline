Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued April 7 memo dissolving NCET "effective immediately," ending Biden-era crypto enforcement unit established 2021-2022. DOJ shifted from "regulation by prosecution" to crypto-friendly approach, explicitly stating it won't pursue enforcement against exchanges, mixing services, or offline wallets for user actions or "unwitting violations."
