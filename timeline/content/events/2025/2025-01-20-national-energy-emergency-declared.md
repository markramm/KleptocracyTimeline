Trump declared a national energy emergency on January 20, 2025, stating "We will drill, baby, drill" during inauguration. The order enables emergency permitting procedures, expedites fossil fuel infrastructure, and directs rescinding 2021-2025 environmental regulations. A companion order "Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential" reopens Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and National Petroleum Reserve for drilling, removes Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea restrictions, and increases logging and mining on federal lands. The U.S. is already a net fossil fuel exporter with no shortage, making the emergency declaration legally questionable.
