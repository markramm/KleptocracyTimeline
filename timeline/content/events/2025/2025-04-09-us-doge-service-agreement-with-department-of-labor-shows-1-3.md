A leaked service agreement between the Department of Labor and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) shows a $1.3 million fee for DOGE's work, contradicting Elon Musk's previous claims that DOGE would cost taxpayers nothing. The agreement covers four DOGE affiliates over an 18-month period, with an implied annual salary of approximately $217,000 per staff member.
