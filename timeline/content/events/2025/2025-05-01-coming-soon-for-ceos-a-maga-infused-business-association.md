In 2025, the Trump Administration has established sophisticated mechanisms for business-government coordination, including the American Growth Partnership and the Executive Branch private club. The latter, co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and charging a $500,000 membership fee, provides wealthy CEOs unprecedented access to administration officials. Simultaneously, Business Roundtable meetings and White House tech leader dinners further demonstrate the administration's strategy of monetizing political access.
