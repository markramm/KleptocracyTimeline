Judge John D. Bates ruled April 17, 2025, that unions (AFL-CIO, AFGE, SEIU, others) can proceed with APA challenge against DOGE's access to Americans' PII at DOL, CFPB, HHS. Court found agencies' "across-the-board policies" granting DOGE personnel access to sensitive records constitute "final agency action" reviewable under APA. DOL told staff give DOGE "anything they want." Privacy Act claims denied.
