On August 20, 2025, the United States imposed targeted sanctions on four International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, escalating an ongoing campaign to obstruct international judicial proceedings into potential war crimes.

Key Details:
- Four officials sanctioned: Two judges (Kimberly Prost and Nicolas Guillou) and two deputy prosecutors
- Sanctions include asset freezes and travel bans
- Targeted officials from Canada, France, Fiji, and Senegal
- Follows previous sanctions on ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan and other court officials

Political Context:
- Sanctions primarily targeted officials investigating potential war crimes in Afghanistan and Gaza
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized ICC as a 'national security threat'
- Part of broader strategy to shield US and Israeli personnel from international legal scrutiny

Significance: These sanctions represent a direct challenge to international judicial independence, specifically targeting officials investigating potential war crimes. The move signals an aggressive stance against international accountability mechanisms and undermines the principles of international law.
