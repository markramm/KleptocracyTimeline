Chief Justice John Roberts led a critical federal judicial conference highlighting unprecedented challenges to judicial independence. Roberts warned about four major threats: escalating violence against judges, intimidation tactics, disinformation spread through social media, and potential political attempts to disregard court rulings. The U.S. Marshals Service reported investigating over 1,000 serious threats against judges in the previous five years, signaling a profound breakdown in institutional respect for the judiciary.

Key details revealed by Roberts include:
- Threats against judges have more than tripled in a decade
- Social media has amplified disinformation and personal attacks
- Political actors from multiple parties have suggested potential disregard for court decisions
- The judiciary faces increasing pressure from external political forces

This conference marked a critical moment in addressing the systemic challenges to judicial independence and the rule of law.
