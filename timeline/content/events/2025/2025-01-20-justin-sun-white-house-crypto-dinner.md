Chinese crypto billionaire Justin Sun invested $75 million in Trump's World Liberty Financial (75% of proceeds go to Trump family as fees, netting them ~$56 million) and over $20 million in $TRUMP memecoin, totaling $93+ million in Trump crypto ventures. Sun attended a May 2025 black-tie gala at Trump's Virginia golf club where he received a $100,000 Trump Golden Tourbillon watch. The SEC paused its 2023 fraud charges against Sun after his investment announcement.
