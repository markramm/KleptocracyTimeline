World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff–who is also Steve Witkoff’s son–announced state-backed Emirati investment firm MGX would use Trump’s stablecoin, USD1, for a $2 billion transaction with Binance. Binance, a crypto-exchange platform, has been monitored by the US government since the firm admitted to violating federal money-laundering laws in 2023
