Senator Elizabeth Warren marked Trump's 100th day in office by reading a comprehensive list of 100 documented acts of corruption into the Congressional Record. The list included the mass firing of 18 Inspectors General, the Trump family's $320+ million cryptocurrency scheme, systematic removal of officials investigating Elon Musk's companies, $940 million in coerced free legal services, and unprecedented pay-for-access arrangements. Warren's speech created an official government record of the administration's kleptocratic actions, documenting the transformation of the U.S. government into a vehicle for personal enrichment.
