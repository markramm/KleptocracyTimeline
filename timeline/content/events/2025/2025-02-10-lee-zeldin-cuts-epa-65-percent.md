EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to cut EPA workforce by approximately 23% and reduce the agency's budget by 65%, representing the most aggressive environmental deregulation in agency history. The cuts would return EPA staffing to Reagan-era levels, eliminating scientific research capacity and terminating $20 billion in climate grants.
