Alnur Mussayev, ex-chief of Kazakhstan's National Security Committee, alleged that Vladimir Putin possesses comprehensive kompromat files on Donald Trump, including potential evidence of sexual crimes, financial misconduct, and connections to Jeffrey Epstein's network. Mussayev claims the files are strategically maintained to control Trump's geopolitical alignment rather than to expose him publicly.
