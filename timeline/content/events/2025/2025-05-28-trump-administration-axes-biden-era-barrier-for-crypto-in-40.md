The Trump administration rescinded Biden-era guidance warning employers about adding cryptocurrency to employee 401(k) plans, with a subsequent executive order on August 7, 2025, further expanding alternative asset investment options. This action allows for more cryptocurrency and digital asset investments in retirement accounts, marking a significant shift in retirement investment policy.
