Donald Trump Jr. met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić on March 11, 2025, his second
visit in six months, to promote a Trump International Hotel project in Belgrade—the first
Trump hotel in Europe. The 175-room hotel with 1,500 luxury apartments will be built on
the site of the former Yugoslav Ministry of Defense bombed by NATO. The visit occurred
amid massive anti-government protests with over 100,000 demonstrators. Trump Jr. conducted
a podcast interview with Vučić and expressed support for the embattled leader, marking
what NYT called "perhaps the most explicit mixing so far" of U.S. foreign policy and
Trump family financial interests in the second term.
