Trump implements 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, 10% on China effective February 4, 2025, with plans for universal 10% tariffs. Senate Democrats later call for SEC investigation after Trump posts "GREAT TIME TO BUY" before announcing tariff pause in April, raising his net worth by $415 million in one day as markets surge 9.5%. Legal experts cite potential market manipulation.
