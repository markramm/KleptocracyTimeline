Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump Media shares on April 2, 2025, coinciding with Trump's major tariff announcement. The stock sale, part of an ethics divestment, occurred when Trump Media's stock was near its lowest point, dropping over 10% following the tariff declaration.
