Trump announced June 2025 that FEMA would be eliminated by December 2025, after Atlantic hurricane season ends in November. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed elimination plans. 20-member FEMA Review Council formed May 2025 to recommend changes by mid-November. Trump wants states to handle disasters with federal reimbursement. Agency projected to lose 30% of workforce (26,000 to 18,000) by year end. Project 2025 calls for reducing federal disaster relief from 75% to 25%, privatizing flood insurance.
