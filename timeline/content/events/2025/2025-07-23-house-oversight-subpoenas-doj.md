The House Oversight subcommittee voted 8-2 to subpoena the DOJ for Epstein files on July 23, 2025, with three Republicans—Nancy Mace (R-SC), Scott Perry (R-PA), and Brian Jack (R-GA)—breaking ranks to join Democrats in demanding transparency. This bipartisan rebellion followed the DOJ's July 7 memo claiming no client list exists and marked unprecedented congressional pushback against Trump's reversal on his campaign promise of "100% transparency" on Epstein files.
