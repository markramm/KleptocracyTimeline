Madison Sheahan, a 28-year-old former aide to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem with no law enforcement experience, was appointed ICE Deputy Director on March 9, 2025. Federal law requires the ICE Director to have "a minimum of 5 years professional experience in law enforcement, and a minimum of 5 years of management experience," qualifications Sheahan lacks. Her only prior role was overseeing Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, where she conducted controversial homeless sweeps in New Orleans. She now oversees 20,000 employees and a $9 billion budget.
