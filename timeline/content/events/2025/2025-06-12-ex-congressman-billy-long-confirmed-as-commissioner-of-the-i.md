The Senate confirmed Billy Long, a former Republican congressman who previously sought to abolish the IRS, as the agency's new commissioner. Long was confirmed on a 53-44 party-line vote despite concerns about his past work with a firm involved in pandemic tax credit fraud and his lack of tax administration experience. Notably, he was removed from the position in August 2025, making him the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner in history.
