President Trump pardoned approximately 1,500 January 6 defendants on his first day in office, including violent offenders who assaulted police officers. Pardoned Proud Boys leaders like Enrique Tarrio returned to public activism, with Joe Biggs describing their CPAC reception as "we're like Gods." Multiple pardoned defendants re-arrested within weeks for new crimes including domestic violence and burglary. Others filed $100 million lawsuits against DOJ claiming wrongful prosecution. Mass pardons sent unprecedented signal that political violence carries no consequences if aligned with right cause, marking watershed moment in normalization of violence.
