Donald Trump's second inaugural fund received over $19 million from fossil fuel companies, including $2 million from Chevron and $1 million donations from ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Occidental Petroleum. These donations came after Trump promised oil executives at a Mar-a-Lago meeting significant regulatory rollbacks in exchange for campaign support.
