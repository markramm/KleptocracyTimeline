Elon Musk awarded a $1 million payment to a Wisconsin voter days before the state Supreme Court election, part of a broader $20 million effort to influence the race. The payment to Scott Ainsworth, who supports conservative candidate Brad Schimel, prompted a legal challenge from Wisconsin's Attorney General as a potential election law violation.
