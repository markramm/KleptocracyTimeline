One Big Beautiful Bill provides $45 billion for building new immigration detention centers, with overwhelming majority going to private companies contracted to build and run facilities. Represents 308% increase over ICE's FY2024 detention budget, creating capacity for 125,000 beds operated by private contractors rather than federal employees. Part of $170 billion immigration enforcement funding channeled through reconciliation to avoid congressional oversight.
