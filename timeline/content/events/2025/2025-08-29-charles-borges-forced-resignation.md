Charles Borges, SSA's Chief Data Officer, submitted an "involuntary resignation" citing
retaliation after his whistleblower complaint about DOGE's mishandling of 300 million
Americans' Social Security data became public. Borges reported experiencing "exclusion,
isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear" creating intolerable work conditions.
His resignation email was deleted from staff inboxes within 30 minutes, and SSA employees
reported extremely low morale after "losing a ton of people" since DOGE's installation.
