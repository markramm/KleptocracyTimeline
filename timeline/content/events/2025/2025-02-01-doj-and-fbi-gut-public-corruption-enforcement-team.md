Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel gave a "green light to would-be lawbreakers" by gutting the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section and folding one of the FBI's public corruption squads. Democrats warned that DOJ's refusal to enforce anti-corruption laws betrays the public trust and will create lasting harm to Americans' faith in the integrity of government officials.
