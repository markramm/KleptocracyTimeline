In a landmark whistleblower disclosure, Charles Borges, Chief Data Officer of the Social Security Administration (SSA), revealed that Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) officials improperly accessed and attempted to copy the entire NUMIDENT database, containing sensitive personal information for over 300 million Americans.

Key Details:
- NUMIDENT database includes Social Security numbers, names, birthdates, citizenship data, and family details
- Former DOGE employee John Solly requested copying the database to a private cloud on June 10, 2025
- SSA Risk Assessment warned unauthorized access would have 'catastrophic impact'
- Borges filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Project
- Cybersecurity officials discussed potential need to reissue Social Security numbers

Significance: This incident represents a critical breach of data privacy protocols and raises profound questions about government agencies' handling of sensitive personal information. The potential for widespread identity theft and systematic vulnerability of millions of Americans' personal data underscores the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures.
