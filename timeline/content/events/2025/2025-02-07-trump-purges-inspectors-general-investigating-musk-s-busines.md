President Trump executed a coordinated mass firing of approximately 17 inspectors general across federal agencies on February 7, 2025, in an unprecedented action that effectively dismantled critical government oversight mechanisms. The purge targeted inspectors general conducting sensitive investigations, particularly those probing Elon Musk's businesses and government contracts. Key targets included Defense Department Inspector General Robert Storch, who was investigating SpaceX's national security reporting failures, and USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong, overseeing a Neuralink investigation. Eight of the fired inspectors general subsequently filed lawsuits challenging their dismissal, arguing the firings compromised government accountability. Multiple agencies were impacted, including the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Labor, Transportation, and the EPA, each with ongoing investigations into Musk's companies. Federal judge Ana C. Reyes ruled the firings unlawful but did not reinstate the inspectors general, highlighting the complex legal and political implications of this systematic oversight disruption.
