Trump administration implements Project 2025's Schedule F recommendation, rebranded as 'Schedule Policy/Career,' identifying approximately 50,000 federal positions for reclassification from career civil servants to political appointees screened for ideological loyalty. This move enables agencies to more easily remove policy-influencing employees, undermining traditional civil service protections.
