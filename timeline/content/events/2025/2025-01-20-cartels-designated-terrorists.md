Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, creating a process to designate Mexican drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The order directs cabinet officials to make recommendations within 14 days and prepare to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. This enables material support prosecutions against anyone providing assistance to cartels, with vast implications for cross-border trade and migration. Mexican President Sheinbaum defended sovereignty while pledging coordination. The designation was considered but rejected during Trump's first term and Obama administration due to bilateral relations concerns.
