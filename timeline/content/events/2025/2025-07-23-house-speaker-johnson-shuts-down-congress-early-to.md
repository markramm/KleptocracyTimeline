House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly sends Congress into early summer recess on July 23, 2025, specifically to prevent a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act discharge petition led by Representatives Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA). The petition had gained bipartisan momentum following public pressure for transparency about Jeffrey Epstein's connections. Johnson announced July 21 he would block any Epstein-related votes, then executed the early shutdown two days later.
