Department of Government Efficiency attempted to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau through mass firings, but federal judges blocked the action and ordered reinstatement
of workers. The attempted dismantling affected 1,500 CFPB employees before court intervention.
Multiple judges ruled the firings violated due process and federal law, forcing the Trump
administration to reinstate nearly 25,000 workers across various agencies.
