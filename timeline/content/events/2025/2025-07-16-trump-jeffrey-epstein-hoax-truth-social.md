Trump posted on Truth Social on July 16, 2025, calling the Epstein files issue the "Jeffrey Epstein Hoax" and attacking disappointed supporters as "weaklings" and "past supporters" whose support he no longer wanted. This represented a complete reversal from his campaign promises of "100% transparency."
