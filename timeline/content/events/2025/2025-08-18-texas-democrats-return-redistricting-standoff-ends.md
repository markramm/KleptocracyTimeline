Texas House Democrats return to Austin after 2-week quorum break in Illinois, ending resistance to Trump-ordered congressional redistricting. Republicans impose 24-hour security surveillance requiring DPS escorts and "permission slips" to leave chamber. Rep. Nicole Collier refuses, remains locked in chamber overnight calling herself "political prisoner."
