Meta settled a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump for $25 million over his social media account suspensions following the January 6 Capitol attack. Most of the settlement, approximately $22 million, will go to Trump's presidential library. Critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren view the settlement as a form of corporate appeasement.
