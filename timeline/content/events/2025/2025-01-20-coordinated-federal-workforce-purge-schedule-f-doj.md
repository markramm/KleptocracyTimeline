Trump administration implements Schedule F executive order on first day of presidency, systematically dismantling civil service protections and targeting DOJ prosecution staff. The order reclassifies an estimated 50,000 federal workers, effectively politicizing key policy positions and allowing immediate termination of career employees. Specific actions include firing DOJ prosecutors Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Anne McNamara, and Mary Dohrmann, while demanding lists of federal employees for potential reclassification or removal.

The Schedule F order creates a new 'Schedule Policy/Career' category that strips civil service protections from employees with 'policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential duties'. This unprecedented move threatens the independence of federal agencies, particularly the Department of Justice, by enabling wholesale political replacement of career staff.
