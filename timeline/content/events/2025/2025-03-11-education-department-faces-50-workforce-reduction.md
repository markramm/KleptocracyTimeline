Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced massive workforce reduction at the Department of Education, eliminating nearly 1,300 positions across all divisions. The cuts, directly aligned with Project 2025's recommendation to dismantle the department, will impact Federal Student Aid, Institute of Education Sciences, and the Office for Civil Rights. McMahon claimed the reduction ensures 'efficiency and accountability', while unions decry the move as 'draconian'.
