The ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, and Protect Democracy formed a comprehensive legal resistance network to challenge potential constitutional overreaches. Developed as a multi-jurisdictional strategy, the network includes seven strategic roadmaps for coordinated litigation across voting rights, immigration due process, LGBTQ rights, and First Amendment protections. The initiative emphasizes state supreme court litigation and coordinated advocacy to defend civil liberties during a challenging political environment. Key leaders like Julie Murray and Matthew Segal are strategically leveraging ACLU lawyers in all 50 states to pursue cases that can expand rights protections through state constitutions, serving as a powerful legal backstop against potential rights curtailments.
