Troy Meink, Trump's Air Force Secretary nominee, allegedly structured a multibillion-dollar
National Reconnaissance Office spy satellite contract to favor Musk's SpaceX, according
to Reuters investigation. Democratic senators Warren and Duckworth raised concerns
about potential quid pro quo between Musk and Meink. The Senate later confirmed Meink
in May 2025 despite the controversy.
