Leading civil rights attorneys and legal organizations form a coordinated nationwide network to challenge unconstitutional policy implementations and protect fundamental rights. The network develops shared litigation strategies and pro bono support mechanisms. The Democracy 2025 coalition, comprising 280+ legal organizations and 800+ experts, prepares multimillion-dollar legal efforts to combat potential threats to civil rights, national security, and democratic institutions.
