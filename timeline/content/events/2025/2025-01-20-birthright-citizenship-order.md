On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order challenging birthright citizenship, targeting children born to non-citizen or undocumented parents. The order, which directly mirrors Project 2025 recommendations, seeks to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, immediately facing multiple federal lawsuits and judicial injunctions.
