Christopher Garcia, CEO of Health Supply US which has received $179 million in government
contracts primarily from Defense and Homeland Security, purchased Vice President JD Vance's
Alexandria, Virginia home on March 14 for $1.9 million—$172,025 over the $1.69 million
asking price. Garcia, who served as a Trump Commerce Department appointee from 2017-2018
and later registered as a lobbyist, bought the property through Nevada LLC 9 EDR just
five days after it was listed. Vance had purchased the five-bedroom farmhouse for $1.64
million in February 2023. The above-market purchase by a government contractor with
extensive federal business raises conflict of interest concerns.
