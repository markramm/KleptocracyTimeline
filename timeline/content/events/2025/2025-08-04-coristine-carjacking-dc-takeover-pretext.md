Edward "Big Balls" Coristine, 19, was assaulted during attempted carjacking by 10 teenagers
in Logan Circle at 3 AM. Trump immediately used the incident to threaten federal takeover
of DC, stating "If D.C. doesn't get its act together, we will have no choice but to take
Federal control." This occurred despite violent crime being down 26% and at 30-year lows.
The incident became pretext for deploying 1,450+ National Guard troops to DC, placing
local police under federal control.
