The Trump administration's Department of Justice agreed to pay $5 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Ashli Babbitt, the January 6 rioter fatally shot while attempting to breach the Capitol. The settlement, which resolves a $30 million suit, drew criticism from Capitol Police leadership who argued it sends a 'chilling message' to law enforcement.
