Trump administration moves to revert to weak Trump-era overtime threshold ($35,568) from Biden's $58,656 rule, stripping overtime protections from 4.3 million workers per Economic Policy Institute. Project 2025 also proposes calculating overtime over 2-4 week periods instead of weekly, and substituting comp time for time-and-a-half pay, further eroding worker protections.
