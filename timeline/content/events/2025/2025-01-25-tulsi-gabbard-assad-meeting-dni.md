Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, confirmed by a narrow 52-48 Senate vote, faces intense scrutiny over her 2017 secret meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and consistent pro-Russia positioning. Her minimal intelligence experience and controversial past have raised significant concerns among intelligence allies about potential security risks.
