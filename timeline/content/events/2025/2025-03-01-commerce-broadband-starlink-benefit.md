Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick overhauled the $42.5B BEAD broadband program to adopt "tech-neutral approach" allowing satellite providers like Starlink to receive $10-20B instead of expected $4.1B, while directing staff to "increase satellite usage regardless of other considerations" and specifically recommending Elon Musk's Starlink to rural broadband leaders.
