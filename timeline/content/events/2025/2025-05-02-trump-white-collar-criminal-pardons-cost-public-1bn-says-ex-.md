A House Judiciary Committee review revealed that Trump's pardons eliminated $1.3 billion in restitution from white-collar criminals and January 6 defendants. Notable cases include Todd Chrisley's $17.7 million tax fraud pardon, Carlos Watson's $36.7 million investor fraud clemency, and Lawrence Duran's $87 million Medicare fraud pardon. Only 15% of $3 million in Capitol riot damages had been recovered before these pardons.
