USAID Inspector General Paul Martin was fired on February 11, 2025, shortly after his office published a critical report warning that the administration's foreign aid freeze had compromised oversight of $8.2 billion in humanitarian funds. Martin was the 18th inspector general removed by the Trump administration, highlighting a pattern of retaliating against watchdogs who document unfavorable policy consequences.
