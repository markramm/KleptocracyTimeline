In a significant escalation of institutional capture, President Trump fired 17 inspectors general across multiple federal agencies in late January 2025. The mass firings, done without the legally required 30-day congressional notice, targeted watchdogs investigating potential misconduct in agencies including Defense, Agriculture, and Transportation. The move created a culture of fear among government oversight personnel and raised serious concerns about potential obstruction of ongoing investigations.
