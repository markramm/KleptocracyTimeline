President Trump publicly demands Texas Governor Abbott conduct unprecedented mid-cycle redistricting to create 5 new safe Republican congressional seats. Abbott initially resists, citing constitutional concerns and costs. Democratic legislators flee to Illinois to break quorum, with civil arrest warrants issued and $500/day fines imposed for absent members.
