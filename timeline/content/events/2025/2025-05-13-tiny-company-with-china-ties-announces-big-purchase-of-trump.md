GD Culture Group, a small Nasdaq-traded technology company with ties to China, announced plans to purchase up to $300 million in Bitcoin and $TRUMP cryptocurrency. The investment comes amid financial challenges for the company, including a Nasdaq delisting warning and a $14.1 million net loss in 2024. The purchase involves selling common stock to an unnamed British Virgin Islands entity, raising questions about foreign influence and potential conflicts of interest.
