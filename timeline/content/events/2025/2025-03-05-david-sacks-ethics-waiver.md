White House issued March 5 ethics waiver allowing David Sacks to shape crypto policy despite remaining financial interests in digital assets through Craft Ventures. Despite selling $200M in liquid crypto holdings, Sacks retained stakes in BitGo and Lightning Labs. Warren questioned the conflict as Sacks co-hosted $1.5M crypto fundraiser while guiding national crypto policy.
