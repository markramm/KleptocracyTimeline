The Department of Justice announced plans to challenge the constitutional protections that prevent the president from arbitrarily firing leaders of independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that current laws protecting agency leadership are unconstitutional, potentially opening the door to direct executive branch interference in regulatory bodies.
