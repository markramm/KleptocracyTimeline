Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill" signed July 4, 2025 expanded SNAP work requirements to ages 18-64, affecting parents with children 14+, veterans, homeless individuals, and former foster youth. CBO projects 2.4-3 million Americans will lose benefits. Simultaneously threatens elimination of Head Start program serving 750,000-800,000 children.
