During a press conference by Jeffrey Epstein survivors at the U.S. Capitol calling for transparency about Epstein's connections, a formation of military jets (4 F-35s and 4 F-16s) conducts an extremely loud flyover, drowning out survivor testimony about Trump-Epstein connections. The White House later claims the flyover was to honor a Polish F-16 pilot who died in a crash, though the timing and route directly over the survivors' event raises questions about potential intimidation. The discharge petition for Epstein files transparency reached 215 signatures following the event.
