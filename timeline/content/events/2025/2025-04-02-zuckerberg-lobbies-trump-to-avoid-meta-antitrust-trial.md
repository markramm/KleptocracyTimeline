Mark Zuckerberg lobbied President Trump to settle a 2020 FTC antitrust case that
seeks to unwind Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp for allegedly maintaining
an illegal monopoly. The case was set for trial on April 14, 2025. According to WSJ,
negotiations failed and the trial proceeded as scheduled. The FTC case, originally
filed under the first Trump administration, alleges Meta crushed competition through
strategic acquisitions.
