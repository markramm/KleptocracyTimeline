The Trump family, in partnership with the Witkoffs, quietly seized control of World Liberty Financial after raising $550 million through sales of WLFI tokens. The venture includes a USD1 stablecoin and has attracted significant foreign investment, including a potential $2 billion deal with an Abu Dhabi state-backed investment firm.
