EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced formal reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding on July 29, calling repeal "largest deregulatory action in history of America." Finding declared CO2 and 5 other GHGs endanger public health. Repeal would eliminate legal basis for all climate rules on power plants, vehicles, oil/gas industry. Would save $54B annually per Zeldin. Public hearings Aug 19-21, comments through Sept 15. Trump EO on Day 1 questioned "legality and continuing applicability."
