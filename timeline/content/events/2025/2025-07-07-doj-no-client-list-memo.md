The DOJ released a two-page memo on July 7, 2025, declaring "no incriminating 'client list'" existed, that Epstein died by suicide, and that "no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted." This directly contradicted Attorney General Bondi's February statement about having a "client list" on her desk.
