President Trump signed the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act), creating the first federal regulatory system for stablecoins. The legislation requires 100% reserve backing and monthly public disclosures, simultaneously establishing a legal framework that benefits World Liberty Financial's USD1 stablecoin, a venture partially owned by the Trump family.
