President Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, committing the U.S. government to stockpile Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The reserve will be capitalized through forfeited assets and aims to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. The initiative sparked both market excitement and industry skepticism.
