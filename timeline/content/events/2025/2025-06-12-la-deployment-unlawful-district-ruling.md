A federal district judge in Northern California ruled on June 12, 2025, that the Trump administration's federalization of California National Guard and deployment of 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles likely violated the Posse Comitatus Act and principles of federalism. The judge found the military deployment for domestic law enforcement during immigration protests was likely unlawful. The Ninth Circuit quickly stayed this ruling on June 19, allowing troops to remain deployed while the administration appealed. A final ruling on September 2, 2025, definitively barred President Trump from using military troops to execute domestic law enforcement actions in California.
