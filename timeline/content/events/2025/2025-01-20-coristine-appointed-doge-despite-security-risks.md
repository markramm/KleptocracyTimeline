Edward "Big Balls" Coristine, 19, was appointed to DOGE and granted access to the State
Department, CISA, DHS, FEMA, and Office of Personnel Management despite being fired from
Path Network in 2022 for leaking data and running DiamondCDN which serviced the EGodly
cybercrime group. Coristine was embedded at CISA, giving him access to U.S. intelligence
on worldwide cyber threats. His maternal grandfather was KGB officer Valery Martynov,
executed as a double agent in 1987.
