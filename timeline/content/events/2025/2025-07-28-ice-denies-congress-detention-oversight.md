ICE denied multiple members of Congress access to immigration detention facilities across the country, including Rep. Jason Crow at Aurora, Colorado and six Maryland Democrats at Baltimore's Fallon Federal Building. Despite a 2019 law guaranteeing congressional access for oversight, ICE officials cited new DHS directives requiring seven days advance notice and blocking access to field offices. The Baltimore field office director explicitly stated the denial came from "headquarters."
