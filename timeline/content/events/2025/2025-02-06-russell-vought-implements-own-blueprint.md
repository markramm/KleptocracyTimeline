Russell Vought, who authored Project 2025's chapter on restructuring Executive Office and expanding presidential power, was confirmed as OMB Director on February 6, 2025 by a 53-47 Senate vote. He now implements the exact recommendations he wrote, including using the budget agency to withhold Congressional appropriations and purge agencies of dissenting employees.
