DOJ posted July 7 memo stating no Epstein "client list" exists and no further files would be released, contradicting AG Pam Bondi's earlier claim list was "sitting on my desk." Memo stated "systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list'." Laura Loomer called for Bondi firing. Erick Erickson: "Pam Bondi looked America in eye and said she had Jeffrey Epstein's list. Now she says there never was a list."
