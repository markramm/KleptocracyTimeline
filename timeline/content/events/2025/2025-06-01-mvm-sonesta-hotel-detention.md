ICE contractor MVM Inc. detained Valentina Galvis and her infant son at the Sonesta O'Hare hotel in Chicago for five days in June 2025, continuing the practice of using commercial hotels as unofficial detention centers. MVM employee JoAnna Granado transported them from the hotel. Investigation revealed MVM regularly maintains rooms at Sonesta hotels in Atlanta and Los Angeles as well, suggesting a widespread network of hotel-based detention operating outside standard oversight. This practice violates detention standards requiring proper facilities and allows ICE to circumvent congressional oversight laws.
