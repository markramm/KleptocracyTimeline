Trump's signature budget reconciliation bill increases federal deficits by $3.4 trillion over 10 years while transferring wealth upward, with 65% of benefits flowing to top 10% of earners. Creates multiple opaque funding streams including $100M OMB slush fund for "efficiencies" and $10B DHS border fund with minimal oversight. Permanently extends 2017 tax cuts, expands pass-through deduction to 23%, and raises estate tax exemption to $15 million, directly benefiting Trump Organization structure.
