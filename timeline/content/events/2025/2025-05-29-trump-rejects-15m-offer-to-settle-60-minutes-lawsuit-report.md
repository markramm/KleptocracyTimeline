Paramount Global settled Trump's $20 billion lawsuit over a 2023 '60 Minutes' interview for $16 million, with no direct payment to Trump and an agreement to release future candidate interview transcripts. The settlement comes amid Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media, raising questions about regulatory leverage.
