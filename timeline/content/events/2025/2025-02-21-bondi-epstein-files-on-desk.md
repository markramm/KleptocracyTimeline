Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News host John Roberts on February 21, 2025 that the Epstein client list was "sitting on my desk right now to review," claiming it was a directive from President Trump. This statement was later contradicted by a July 2025 DOJ memo stating no client list existed, leading to significant political fallout and calls for Bondi to explain her handling of the files.
