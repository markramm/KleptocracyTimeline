In response to increased political pressure on nonprofits, a comprehensive legal defense initiative was launched to provide strategic litigation support, with multiple organizations creating defense funds totaling over $65 million. The Democracy 2025 coalition, comprising 280+ organizations and 800+ individual members, aims to protect civil society organizations facing systemic challenges through coordinated legal action, public advocacy, and strategic resistance.
