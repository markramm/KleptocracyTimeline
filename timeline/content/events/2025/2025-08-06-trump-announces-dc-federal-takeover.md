Trump announced federal takeover of Washington DC police department and deployment of
National Guard, using the assault on Edward Coristine as justification. Trump stated he
was considering "having his administration take over the DC Police Department" and
bringing in National Guard. This represented unprecedented federal control over the
nation's capital's local law enforcement, exploiting a single assault incident despite
crime being at 30-year lows.
