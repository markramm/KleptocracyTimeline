The Trump administration fired nearly all USAID employees by placing them on administrative leave, cutting the workforce from over 10,000 to 294 employees (97% reduction). The mass firing disrupted humanitarian programs globally and prompted lawsuits from the American Foreign Service Association. More than 1,000 USAID employees and contractors were fired or furloughed after the federal funding freeze.
