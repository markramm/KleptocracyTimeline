SpaceX confirmed a loan agreement with L3Harris to provide Starlink satellite communication terminals to the FAA for infrastructure testing, specifically in Alaska. The agreement involves providing 4,000 Starlink kits free of charge for an initial evaluation period, raising potential conflict of interest concerns given Musk's role in the Trump administration.
