The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the Trump administration permanently dismissed its enforcement action against Solo Funds, a fintech platform providing small-dollar loans. The lawsuit, originally filed in May 2024, alleged deceptive lending practices with loans potentially carrying annual percentage rates over 1,000%. Acting Director Russ Vought claimed the dismissal was stopping 'weaponization' of consumer protection.
