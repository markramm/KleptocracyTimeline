An extensive financial investigation revealed a sophisticated insider trading scheme involving the $MELANIA memecoin. 24 crypto wallets purchased $2.6 million in tokens just moments before the public launch, with one wallet tied to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Hayden Davis generating a $39 million profit within 24 hours. The coordinated trading raised serious ethical concerns about conflicts of interest in cryptocurrency ventures connected to the Trump family.
