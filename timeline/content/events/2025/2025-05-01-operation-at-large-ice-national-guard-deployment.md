In May 2025, ICE launched "Operation At Large," a massive nationwide plan to dramatically increase arrests of unauthorized immigrants. The operation includes more than 5,000 personnel from across federal law enforcement agencies and a requested 21,000 National Guard troops, representing the largest domestic immigration enforcement mobilization in U.S. history. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller pushed for a target of 3,000 migrant detentions per day, signaling an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Multiple federal agencies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, and DEA, were redirected to support this operation, demonstrating a comprehensive shift in federal law enforcement priorities.
