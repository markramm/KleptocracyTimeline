President Trump pardoned Nikola founder Trevor Milton, who was convicted of securities fraud in October 2022, after Milton donated $1.8M to Trump's 2024 re-election campaign. The pardon effectively eliminates $695.2 million in potential restitution to Nikola shareholders and prevents further legal consequences for Milton's fraudulent actions.
