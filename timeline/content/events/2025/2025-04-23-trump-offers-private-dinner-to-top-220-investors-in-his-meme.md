President Trump announced a private dinner for the top 220 holders of his memecoin, causing the token's price to spike 58% within an hour. The event raised significant concerns about potential market manipulation and foreign influence, prompting calls for DOJ and congressional investigations from Congressmen Sean Casten, Adam Smith, and Jamie Raskin. Notable investigations highlighted that 19 of the top 25 memecoin holders were likely foreign nationals, including Chinese billionaire Justin Sun, who owned over $18 million worth of the token.
