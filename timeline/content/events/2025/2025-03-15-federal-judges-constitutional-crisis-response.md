In an unprecedented response to mounting threats and potential constitutional crisis, federal judges convened emergency discussions in March 2025 to address challenges to judicial independence. The Judicial Conference, the national policymaking body for federal courts, held closed-door meetings where judges discussed escalating threats, potential security measures, and strategies to preserve constitutional integrity.

Key Developments:
- 162 judges threatened between March and early April 2025
- Two senior federal judges publicly condemned threats against the judiciary
- Discussions of creating independent judicial security mechanisms
- Concerns about judicial independence under the Trump administration

Implications:
- Unprecedented level of threats against federal judiciary
- Potential breakdown of constitutional checks and balances
- Judges considering extraordinary measures to protect institutional independence
