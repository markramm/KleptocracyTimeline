By August 7, 2025, President Trump had signed 202 executive orders, with independent analyses confirming that approximately two-thirds mirror the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 proposals - an agenda Trump previously disavowed during his campaign. Key domains include civil rights dismantling, gender policy reversion, energy deregulation, and border security militarization.

Key Policy Domains:
- Civil Rights: Elimination of diversity and affirmative action programs
- Gender Policy: Rescinding LGBTQ+ protections
- Energy: Expanding fossil fuel drilling
- Border Security: Militarizing immigration enforcement

Notable contributors to Project 2025 like Brendan Carr, Russ Vought, Tom Homan, John Ratcliffe, and Pete Hoekstra have direct connections to Trump's current administration, revealing a systematic implementation of the Heritage Foundation's authoritarian blueprint.
