Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem held a tense meeting at ICE headquarters demanding field offices achieve 3,000 daily arrests—triple the early administration numbers. Miller threatened to fire the bottom 10% of directors monthly if quotas weren't met. A week later, Kenneth Genalo (33-year ICE veteran) was forced to retire and Robert Hammer (20-year HSI veteran) was reassigned for failing to meet the impossible quotas. The day before the purge, agents achieved only 1,600 arrests, well short of Miller's demands.
