FAA approved shipment of 4,000 Starlink terminals and ordered staff to find "tens of millions of dollars" for Starlink deal while considering canceling $2.4B Verizon contract for air traffic control communications. Creates conflict as DOGE leader Musk oversees federal spending cuts while his companies receive contracts. Officials avoiding paper trails by delivering orders verbally.
