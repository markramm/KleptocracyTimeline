In response to mounting challenges to constitutional governance, leading constitutional law experts create a centralized war room to develop rapid response strategies for potential institutional capture and constitutional violations. The initiative, involving a coalition of over 280 legal organizations including Democracy 2025 and Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG), focuses on coordinating strategic litigation, providing pro bono legal resources, and creating a comprehensive legal defense infrastructure to protect democratic institutions.
