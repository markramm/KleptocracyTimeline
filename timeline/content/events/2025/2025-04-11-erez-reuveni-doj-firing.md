Erez Reuveni, a 15-year DOJ veteran and Acting Deputy Director of Immigration Litigation, was fired April 11, 2025, after refusing to file briefs with misrepresentations and truthfully informing a judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia had been wrongfully deported to El Salvador. At an April 4 hearing, Reuveni admitted government error, stating "We concede he should not have been removed." His whistleblower complaint alleges Emil Bove said DOJ would tell courts "f*** you" and ignore orders, with deportation "planes needed to take off no matter what." Reuveni previously won awards from Republican appointees in Trump's first term.
