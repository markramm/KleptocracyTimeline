The Trump administration proposed a $6 billion cut to NASA's budget in 2025, strategically redirecting $1 billion towards Mars exploration while eliminating multiple ongoing scientific missions. This move aligns with Elon Musk's SpaceX interests and represents a significant shift in space exploration priorities, effectively privatizing and commercializing NASA's traditional scientific research programs.
