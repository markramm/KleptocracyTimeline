World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project linked to Trump's family, strategically acquired approximately $55 million worth of Ether (ETH) following market disruptions caused by Trump's brief tariff imposition on Mexico and Canada. This purchase was part of a larger pattern of aggressive cryptocurrency investment, with the project accumulating over $388 million in digital assets by early 2025.
