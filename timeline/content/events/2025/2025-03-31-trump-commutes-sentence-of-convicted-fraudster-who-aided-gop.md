President Trump commuted the prison sentence of Jason Galanis, who was serving a 189-month sentence for defrauding the Wakpamni Lake Community Corporation of over $38 million in tribal economic development bonds. The clemency eliminates all remaining fines, restitution, and probation conditions, and follows Galanis's testimony in the Republican impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden.
