Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida rotated between $1-5 million from Pimco bond funds into stock funds on February 27, 2020, just one day before Fed Chair Powell's emergency statement about coronavirus risks. Clarida sold multiple ETFs during the market's COVID-19 downturn and quickly reinvested the proceeds, raising questions about potential insider trading. These transactions occurred when the S&P 500 fell 13% due to coronavirus panic, and one day before Powell's unusual public statement assuring market preparedness. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for an SEC investigation, ultimately leading to Clarida's resignation in January 2022. The incident exemplifies a systematic pattern of potential conflict of interest where high-level financial regulators may exploit advance knowledge of monetary policy for personal financial gain.
