Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, appointed despite lacking postal experience and having conflicts of interest with USPS competitors, removed 711 high-speed mail sorting machines capable of processing 21.4 million pieces per hour during the 2020 election mail voting surge. DeJoy also eliminated overtime, removed collection boxes, and implemented operational changes that caused widespread mail delays. Documents revealed the removals disproportionately affected Democratic-leaning areas. Federal judges found DeJoy's changes were 'an intentional effort on the part of the current Administration to disrupt and challenge the legitimacy of upcoming local, state, and federal elections.' Despite court orders, many machines were destroyed and could not be reinstalled.
