At a New York real estate conference, Donald Trump Jr. stated: "Russians make up a pretty
disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in
from Russia." He specifically mentioned Dubai, Trump SoHo, and New York properties. This
admission revealed the Trump Organization's significant financial dependence on Russian
money during a period when U.S. banks had blacklisted Trump.
