From 2008-2012, shell companies spent $890 million buying 823 Trump condos in cash – 25% of units sold. Delaware LLCs bought an additional 75 Trump condos for $129 million. More than 87% were in Trump-licensed buildings, with sales surging during Trump's financial troubles when he couldn't make a $40 million loan payment and faced $2 billion in accumulated debt.
