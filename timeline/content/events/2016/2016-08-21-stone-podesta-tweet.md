Roger Stone tweeted "Trust me, it will soon be the Podesta's time in the barrel" on August 21, 2016 - 47 days before WikiLeaks released Podesta emails on October 7. Even Podesta himself didn't know about the hack until WikiLeaks began leaking. Stone claimed he meant Podesta's business dealings, not emails, despite telling Florida GOP group on August 10 he had "communicated with Julian Assange."
