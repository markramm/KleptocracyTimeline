The investigation exposed offshore financial activities of world leaders, politicians, and celebrities, demonstrating how Mossack Fonseca helped clients launder money, dodge sanctions, and evade taxes. Involving over 370 journalists from 80 countries, the leak uncovered offshore holdings of 140 politicians and public officials, leading to global investigations and over $1.2 billion in recovered funds.
