Republicans achieved an unprecedented victory in the 1994 midterm elections, gaining control of both the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years, ending four decades of Democratic dominance in Congress. Led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, who became Speaker of the House, the GOP united under the "Contract with America," a 10-point legislative platform promising to reduce federal taxes, balance the budget, and reform social welfare programs. This victory was significantly funded by corporate donors and conservative foundations, including major contributions from GOPAC donors. The Heritage Foundation, backed by billionaires like Richard Mellon Scaife and Joseph Coors, provided intellectual foundation for the revolution. The election marked a systematic shift in legislative power, setting the stage for more aggressive conservative policy implementation.
