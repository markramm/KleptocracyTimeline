Formation of the Business Roundtable by CEOs of major corporations like Alcoa and General Electric to coordinate political strategy and policy advocacy. Founded by John D. Harper (Alcoa) and Fred Borch (GE), the organization was created to resist union power, counter growing corporate regulation, and provide a unified voice for large corporations in public policy discussions.
