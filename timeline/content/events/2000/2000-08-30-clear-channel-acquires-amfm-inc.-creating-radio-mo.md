Clear Channel Communications completes its acquisition of AMFM Inc. for 3.5 billion, creating the largest radio broadcasting company in American history with over 1,200 radio stations nationwide - representing 30 times more stations than congressional regulation previously allowed. This mega-merger eliminates Clear Channel's chief competitor and creates an effective monopoly in many local markets, with the company now owning as many as eight stations in certain cities. The consolidation demonstrates the complete failure of the 1996 Telecommunications Act's promise to increase competition, as deregulation instead enabled the creation of unprecedented corporate media control.

The Department of Justice required Clear Channel to divest 99 radio stations in 27 markets to address antitrust concerns, with divestitures valued at approximately $3.4 billion. The FCC further mandated divestiture of 122 radio stations in 37 local markets, including major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, and San Francisco.

Clear Channel now reaches over 110 million Americans weekly, giving the company enormous power to shape political discourse, cultural trends, and consumer behavior through coordinated messaging across its massive network. The acquisition triggers widespread job losses as Clear Channel implements cost-cutting measures, including "voice tracking" technology that allows a single DJ in one city to appear to broadcast live to dozens of different markets simultaneously, destroying thousands of local broadcasting jobs. Local communities lose unique programming, news coverage, and cultural programming as Clear Channel standardizes content across its network, prioritizing advertiser-friendly formats over community service or diverse viewpoints. The merger creates what critics describe as a "radio monopoly" that threatens democratic discourse by concentrating control over local information and political messaging in the hands of a single corporation committed primarily to maximizing shareholder profits rather than serving the public interest.
