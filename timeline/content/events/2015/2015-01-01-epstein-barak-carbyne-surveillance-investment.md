Jeffrey Epstein and Ehud Barak jointly invested in Carbyne (initially Reporty Homeland Security), a sophisticated surveillance technology company co-founded by Pinchas Buchris, former head of Israel's Unit 8200 signals intelligence unit. Carbyne developed an advanced emergency response platform providing complete GPS and camera access during emergency calls, reducing response times by approximately 65%. The partnership strategically positioned the company to seek opportunities in the surveillance industry, attracting later investments from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund in 2018.
