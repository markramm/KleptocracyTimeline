Donald Trump signs letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow while running for president, with lawyer Michael Cohen continuing negotiations through June 2016. Felix Sater boasts: "Our boy can become president...we can engineer it." The 17-page letter proposed a massive development in Moscow, with 250 luxury condos, a hotel, and spa, potentially worth $4 million in initial licensing fees.
