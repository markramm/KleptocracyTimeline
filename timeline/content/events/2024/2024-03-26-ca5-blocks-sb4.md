The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a complex, rapidly evolving ruling keeping Texas SB 4 on hold, highlighting the ongoing legal battle over state versus federal immigration enforcement powers. In a 2-1 decision, the court cited Supreme Court precedent that immigration control is "exclusively a federal power", temporarily blocking the controversial state immigration law.
