Elon Musk established comprehensive political warfare operations through America PAC, combining financial, organizational, and information manipulation to support the Trump 2024 campaign. The PAC spent approximately $200 million, with Musk providing the vast majority of funds, to influence voter targeting and platform messaging. Musk transformed X into a conservative megaphone, systematically amplifying unverified claims and conspiracy theories that benefit the Trump campaign.
