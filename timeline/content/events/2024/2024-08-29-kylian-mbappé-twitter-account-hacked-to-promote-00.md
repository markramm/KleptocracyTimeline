Soccer star Kylian Mbappé's Twitter/X account was hacked for approximately 20 minutes, resulting in the promotion of a '$MBAPPE' cryptocurrency scam. Hackers posted inflammatory content including anti-Semitic messages, claims about a Manchester United transfer, and insults targeting Lionel Messi. The cryptocurrency briefly spiked in value, with one user reportedly making $200,000 from a $286 investment before the posts were deleted.
