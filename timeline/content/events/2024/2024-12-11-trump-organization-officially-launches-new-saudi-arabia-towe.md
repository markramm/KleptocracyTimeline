Eric Trump announced the Trump Organization's first Saudi Arabia project—a 47-floor,
SAR 2 billion ($530M) Trump Tower in Jeddah, developed with London-listed Dar Global.
The tower on Jeddah's Corniche will include Trump Club, the Kingdom's first members-only
social club, with completion targeted for 2028-2029. The announcement came weeks before
Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration, raising conflict of interest concerns.
