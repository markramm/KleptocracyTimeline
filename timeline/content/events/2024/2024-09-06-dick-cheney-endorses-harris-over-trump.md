Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a lifelong Republican who served under George W. Bush (2001-2009), endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president, marking the first time he publicly supported a Democrat for the office. In his statement, Cheney declared that 'In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,' citing Trump's attempts to 'steal the last election using lies and violence.' The endorsement was revealed by his daughter Liz Cheney at the Texas Tribune Festival before being confirmed by Cheney himself. This unprecedented move by one of the GOP's most powerful conservative figures represents a historic break with partisan tradition, as Cheney stated citizens have 'a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.' The Harris campaign called it an honor to have support from the 'well respected' Cheneys, while Trump dismissed Cheney as an 'irrelevant RINO.' The endorsement highlighted the deep fractures within the Republican Party over Trump's fitness for office.
