The Supreme Court unanimously held the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to challenge FDA's 2016/2021 actions on mifepristone, leaving the agency's changes in place. Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion, with the Court finding that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine failed to demonstrate a concrete injury that would grant them legal standing to challenge the FDA's regulation of the abortion medication. This ruling preserves current access to mifepristone through telemedicine and pharmacies.
