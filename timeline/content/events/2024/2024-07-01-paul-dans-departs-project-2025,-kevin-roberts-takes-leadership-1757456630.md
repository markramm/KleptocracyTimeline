Paul Dans steps down as director of Project 2025 at the Heritage Foundation after increasing controversy. Kevin Roberts, Heritage Foundation President, takes over leadership. The project, which proposed significant government restructuring, became politically contentious, with Trump campaign advisers distancing themselves from its detailed proposals. Dans will reportedly shift to focus on election campaign efforts.
