In February 1995, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Whip Tom DeLay formalized the K Street Project, a systematic strategy to transform Washington lobbying by pressuring firms to hire Republicans and limit Democratic influence. By 2003, this approach ensured that 33 of 36 top lobbying positions were held by Republicans, fundamentally reshaping the political influence landscape.
