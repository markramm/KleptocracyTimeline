In Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital (2014), the Supreme Court held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not bar post‑judgment discovery into a foreign sovereign's assets, facilitating creditor collection efforts including by Paul Singer's NML Capital. Justice Samuel Alito joined the 7‑1 majority decision. ProPublica later reported Alito took an undisclosed 2008 private‑jet fishing trip with Singer and did not recuse from the case, raising ethics and conflict-of-interest concerns.
