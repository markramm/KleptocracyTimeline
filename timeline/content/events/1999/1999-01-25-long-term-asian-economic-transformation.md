IMF completes its systematic economic restructuring of Southeast Asian economies, fundamentally transforming corporate landscapes. The intervention results in unprecedented foreign corporate access, weakened local economic sovereignty, and a permanent shift in regional economic power dynamics.

Key Policy Impacts:
- $118 billion in coordinated international loans
- Mandatory structural reforms across financial sectors
- Implemented currency flotation and tightened monetary policies
- Broke down state monopolies and strengthened competition laws
- Exposed and addressed underlying economic vulnerabilities

The intervention set a precedent for future international economic crisis management, demonstrating how multilateral institutions can rapidly reshape national economic systems through strategic financial interventions.
