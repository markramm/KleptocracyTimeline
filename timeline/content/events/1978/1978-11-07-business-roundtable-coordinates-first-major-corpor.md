The Business Roundtable, representing Fortune 500 CEOs, coordinated the first systematic corporate PAC strategy for the 1978 midterm elections. Corporate PACs contributed $9.8 million to federal candidates, with 75% going to business-friendly Republicans. This marked the beginning of coordinated corporate electoral interference and the systematic capture of legislative processes through financial influence.
