The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) was founded in Chicago as the Conservative Caucus of State Legislators, initiated by Mark Rhoads with key involvement from Paul Weyrich. The organization was designed to create a systematic vehicle for corporate and conservative influence over state-level legislation, establishing a platform for corporations to draft model bills and coordinate with state legislators. By 1975, it moved to Washington, D.C., and became a key mechanism for implementing the Powell Memorandum's blueprint for corporate legislative capture.
