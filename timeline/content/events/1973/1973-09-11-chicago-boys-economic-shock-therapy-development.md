In the aftermath of the 1973 Chilean coup, the Chicago Boys, a group of economists trained by Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, began implementing radical free-market economic reforms under Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Their 'shock therapy' approach involved rapid economic liberalization, including dramatic policy shifts: reducing customs duties from 94% to 10%, eliminating certain taxes, weakening labor unions, and privatizing public enterprises.

Key Developments:
- Implemented comprehensive economic transformation under authoritarian conditions
- Reduced industrial production by 28% in 1975
- Drove unemployment beyond 25%
- Dramatically reduced state economic intervention

Implications:
- Demonstrated how psychological manipulation could drive systemic economic transformation
- Created a model of economic restructuring through authoritarian control
- Established precedent for neoliberal economic policy implementation
