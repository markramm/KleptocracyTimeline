Contrary to the original description, Opus Dei received its foundational canonical recognition in 1950 under Pope Pius XII as a secular institute. In 1982, Pope John Paul II established it as the first personal prelature through the apostolic constitution Ut sit, giving it a unique autonomous status within the Catholic Church that transcends geographic boundaries.
