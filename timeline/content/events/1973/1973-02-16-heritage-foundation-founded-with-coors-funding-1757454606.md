The Heritage Foundation was established as a conservative policy research organization, with Joseph Coors of Coors Brewing Company providing critical initial funding of $250,000. Founded by Paul Weyrich, Edwin Feulner, and Joseph Coors, the think tank represented a new model of politically aggressive, ideologically-driven 'expert' organizations designed to influence policy and public opinion, directly inspired by the Powell Memorandum's strategic blueprint for corporate political engagement.
