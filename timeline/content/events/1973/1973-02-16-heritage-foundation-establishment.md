The Heritage Foundation was formally incorporated on February 16, 1973, by Paul Weyrich, Edwin Feulner, and Joseph Coors. Inspired by the Powell Memorandum, the organization was designed to be a conservative counterpoint to liberal think tanks like the Brookings Institution. Joseph Coors provided critical initial funding of $250,000, establishing the foundation as a key platform for conservative policy development. The founders aimed to create an ideologically-driven "expert" organization capable of systematically influencing policy and public opinion from a conservative perspective.
