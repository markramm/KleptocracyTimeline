At Trump SoHo (completed 2010), 77% of sales ($110 million) went to cash-paying shell companies. Property developed by Bayrock Group, whose former finance director Jody Kriss testified it was a "spectacularly corrupt money-laundering and tax evasion" operation. In 2013, Khrapunovs purchased three units for $3.1 million using funds traced to $440 million Kazakhstan bank fraud. Bayrock received "unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in Kazakhstan and Russia."
