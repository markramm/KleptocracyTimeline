Academic research reveals systemic problems with the SEC's 'revolving door' between regulatory agencies and financial institutions. Between 2001-2010, 419 former SEC employees filed 1,949 disclosure statements for private representation, creating significant conflicts of interest. A specific case exemplifies this issue: a senior enforcement official from the SEC's San Francisco office joins Wells Fargo's legal team during a period of active investigations. Research shows that such personnel movements can substantially impact enforcement outcomes, with studies indicating lower damages and fewer criminal cases when defense firms employ former SEC alumni. This pattern demonstrates how financial institutions systematically exploit regulatory relationships by hiring former enforcement officials with intimate knowledge of ongoing investigations, effectively undermining the credibility and independence of financial regulation.
