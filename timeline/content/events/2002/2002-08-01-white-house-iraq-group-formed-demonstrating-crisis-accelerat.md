White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card establishes the White House Iraq Group (WHIG), chaired by Karl Rove, to coordinate a comprehensive propaganda campaign for the Iraq War. This group of senior advisers, including Condoleezza Rice, Scooter Libby, and Karen Hughes, met weekly in the Situation Room to systematically craft public messaging about Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities. Their strategic communications approach demonstrated a deliberate effort to manipulate public opinion and congressional support for military intervention.
