Following WHIG's formation, communications strategists Karen Hughes and Mary Matalin establish systematic coordination protocols with television network executives and booking producers to ensure synchronized messaging during the planned September Iraq campaign rollout. Working as consultants to the Republican National Committee while maintaining daily White House contact, Hughes coordinates with network executives to arrange strategic guest appearances and timing. Mary Matalin, former aide to Vice President Cheney, leverages existing relationships with network executives to establish advance booking arrangements that ensure administration officials appear across multiple networks with consistent messaging. The coordination protocols include advance notification of administration talking points, strategic scheduling to maximize audience reach, and systematic coordination with Sunday show producers at NBC, CBS, and CNN. These institutional relationships transform competitive television networks into cooperative platforms for government messaging, establishing precedent for systematic media coordination that extends beyond individual appearances to encompass scheduling, messaging, and strategic communication planning. The protocols represent a fundamental shift from episodic media relations to systematic institutional coordination between the executive branch and major television networks, creating infrastructure for sustained propaganda campaigns.
