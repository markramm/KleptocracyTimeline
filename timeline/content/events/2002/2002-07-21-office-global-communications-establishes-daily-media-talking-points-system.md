The Bush administration establishes the Office of Global Communications (OGC) to 'formulate and coordinate messages to foreign audiences,' creating an unprecedented infrastructure for distributing daily talking points to reporters, television networks, U.S. embassies, and Congress. The OGC produces 'The Global Messenger,' a daily one-page fact sheet sent worldwide to disseminate key administration talking points on global issues, particularly Iraq. The office coordinates daily conference calls with administration leaders for 'near-term and mid-range communications planning' and arranges strategic television network appearances for U.S. officials. Working in coordination with WHIG, the OGC systematizes propaganda distribution, transforming episodic government communications into a permanent institutional apparatus for message coordination. The OGC's daily talking points system enables synchronized messaging across multiple media platforms, ensuring consistent administration narratives reach diverse audiences simultaneously. This institutionalizes government propaganda operations within the executive branch, creating a permanent infrastructure for coordinated message control that extends beyond individual policy campaigns. The OGC's systematic distribution of pre-written talking points to reporters represents a fundamental erosion of independent journalism, converting news media into transmission mechanisms for government-authored content rather than independent information gathering and analysis.
