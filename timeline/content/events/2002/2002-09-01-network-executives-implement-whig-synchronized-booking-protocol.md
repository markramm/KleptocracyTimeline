The White House Iraq Group (WHIG) successfully coordinated a sophisticated media strategy targeting Sunday morning news shows, systematically deploying key administration officials like Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and Karl Rove to present a unified narrative about the alleged threat posed by Iraq. This coordinated messaging campaign, carefully orchestrated by White House strategists, was designed to build public support for military intervention by presenting a consistent and alarming portrayal of Iraq's weapons capabilities.
