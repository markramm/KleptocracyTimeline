Pentagon's Office of Special Plans under Douglas Feith systematically fabricates intelligence linking Iraq to al Qaeda, coordinating directly with the White House Iraq Group to disseminate these false claims as authoritative intelligence. The Pentagon Inspector General found that OSP developed 'alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al-Qaida relationship' that were 'inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community,' presenting fabricated connections that the CIA had repeatedly debunked. OSP officials Michael Maloof and David Wurmser produced briefings claiming operational relationships between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden that were 'not substantiated by available intelligence,' according to the Senate Intelligence Committee. These fabricated assessments were then coordinated through Douglas Feith's office directly to WHIG for use in public propaganda campaigns, bypassing all normal intelligence community review processes. The systematic fabrication included claims of training camps, meetings between Iraqi intelligence and al Qaeda operatives, and joint operational planning - all of which were later proven false. This coordination between OSP fabrication and WHIG dissemination created what the Senate Intelligence Committee called 'conclusions that were not fully supported by available intelligence,' representing a systematic conspiracy to manufacture false intelligence justifying the Iraq invasion through coordinated deception between Pentagon political appointees and White House propagandists.
