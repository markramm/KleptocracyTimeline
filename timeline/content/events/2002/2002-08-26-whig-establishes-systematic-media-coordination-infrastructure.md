In August 2002, the White House Iraq Group (WHIG) formalized a systematic media coordination infrastructure through strategic meetings with television network executives. By establishing pre-arranged booking protocols, talking point distribution systems, and synchronized messaging frameworks, they transformed media outlets into a unified propaganda apparatus. Network executives agreed to prioritize government access over journalistic independence, creating an unprecedented institutional mechanism for systematic manipulation of public discourse.
