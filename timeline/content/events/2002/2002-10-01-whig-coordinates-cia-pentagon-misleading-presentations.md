The White House Iraq Group orchestrates coordinated misleading presentations by CIA and Pentagon officials to key congressional committees, ensuring executive branch agencies deliver unified disinformation rather than independent intelligence assessments. Through direct coordination with CIA Director George Tenet and Pentagon officials including Douglas Feith's Office of Special Plans, WHIG ensures that congressional briefings present fabricated intelligence as authoritative analysis. The presentations feature manipulated satellite imagery supposedly showing WMD facilities, fabricated technical specifications for alleged nuclear weapons programs, and distorted communications intercepts presented without proper context or expert analysis. WHIG's coordination ensures that CIA and Pentagon officials deliver identical talking points rather than independent professional assessments, corrupting the intelligence community's role as an objective information source for Congress. Congressional committees receive these presentations believing they represent independent intelligence community consensus, unaware that WHIG has orchestrated the content to support predetermined policy conclusions. This systematic coordination corrupts the fundamental relationship between intelligence agencies and Congress, transforming objective intelligence analysis into coordinated executive branch propaganda designed to manipulate legislative decisions.
