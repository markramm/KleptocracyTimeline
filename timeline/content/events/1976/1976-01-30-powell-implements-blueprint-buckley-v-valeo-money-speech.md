Justice Lewis Powell joins the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo (424 U.S. 1), which fundamentally reshaped campaign finance law by equating money with political speech. The Court upheld contribution limits to prevent corruption while striking down expenditure limitations as unconstitutional. This decision represents Powell's first major implementation of his 1971 corporate blueprint memo, establishing a legal framework that protects unlimited political spending under First Amendment free speech protections. 

Key Holdings:
- Upheld contribution limits ($1,000 per candidate, $25,000 annual total)
- Struck down independent expenditure ceilings
- Established that campaign spending is a form of protected political speech

The ruling created a constitutional precedent that corporations and wealthy individuals could use substantial financial resources to influence political discourse, directly advancing the strategic objectives outlined in Powell's corporate memo.
