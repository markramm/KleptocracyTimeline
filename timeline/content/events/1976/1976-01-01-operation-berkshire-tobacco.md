Major multinational tobacco companies secretly coordinated a long-running
strategy to resist regulation and scientific consensus on smoking harms—an
effort known as 'Operation Berkshire.' Internal documents and litigation
disclosures show executives met in the late 1970s (including a 1977 meeting
at Shockerwick House) and subsequently created international front groups
(ICOSI/INFOTAB) to shape policy and messaging worldwide.
