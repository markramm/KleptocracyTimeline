The first coordinated nationwide Tax Day Tea Party protests take place across the United States, organized primarily by Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and FreedomWorks - both organizations rooted in the Koch brothers' network. These protests, while presented as grassroots citizen uprisings against government spending and taxation, were strategically orchestrated by well-funded corporate advocacy groups. Drawing inspiration from Rick Santelli's February 19, 2009 CNBC rant, the protests drew over 250,000 participants across the country, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Koch network's astroturfing infrastructure in creating the appearance of organic citizen outrage while advancing specific political and economic interests.
