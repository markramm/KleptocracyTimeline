## 📅 Recommended Action Plan

### Week 1: Validation Infrastructure
1. Create validation tracking system
2. Build human validation interface
3. Begin validating critical events (importance 8+)
4. Continue source archiving

### Week 2: Quality Assurance
1. Complete validation of high-priority events
2. Fix broken links
3. Add missing sources
4. Update documentation

### Week 3: Deployment
1. Set up GitHub Pages
2. Configure CI/CD
3. Deploy viewer app
4. Test production environment

### Week 4: Community Launch
1. Add collaboration features

## 📝 Notes

### Known Issues
1. No validation tracking in YAML files
2. Many URLs not archived
3. Some sources may be broken
4. No deployment pipeline
5. Missing collaboration features

### Questions to Resolve
1. What constitutes "validated" status?
2. Who can validate events?
3. How many validators per event?
4. Should we version the timeline data?
5. How to handle disputed events?

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 100% of critical events validated
- [ ] >80% of sources archived
- [ ] <5% broken links
- [ ] Deployment automated
- [ ] Community contributions enabled

**Overall Launch Readiness: 35%**

The project has strong infrastructure and UI but lacks validation tracking and deployment setup. Priority should be on creating a validation system and completing QA of critical events.
