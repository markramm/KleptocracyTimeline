# Research CLI - Root Level Wrapper
#
# Convenience wrapper at repository root that delegates to research-server/research
#
# Usage from repository root:
#   ./research <command> [options]
#

# Get the directory where this script is located (repo root)
REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Delegate to the actual CLI wrapper
exec "${REPO_ROOT}/research-server/research" "$@"
