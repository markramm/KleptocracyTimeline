  "title": "Trump Attempts Unprecedented Removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook",
  "summary": "In an unprecedented and legally contested move, President Donald Trump attempted to unilaterally remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on August 25, 2025, citing mortgage fraud allegations from Bill Pulte. This action represents a direct challenge to the Federal Reserve's institutional independence and potentially unconstitutional executive overreach.\n\nKey Details:\n- Trump claimed to be firing Cook based on a 'criminal referral' by William Pulte regarding two 2021 home loans\n- Cook is the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board in its 111-year history\n- Her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, characterized the removal as 'unprecedented and illegal'\n- Federal Judge Jia Cobb granted a temporary restraining order blocking the firing\n- Judge concluded Trump violated the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' removal provision\n\nLegal Context:\n- The Federal Reserve Act only permits removing a governor 'for cause'\n- 'For cause' is legally interpreted as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\n- Trump did not allege any misconduct in Cook's official duties\n\nSignificance: This incident highlights critical tensions between executive power and institutional independence, raising profound questions about the potential political manipulation of economic governance and the preservation of democratic norms.",
