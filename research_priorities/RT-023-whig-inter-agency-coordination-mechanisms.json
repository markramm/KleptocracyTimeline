  "title": "WHIG Inter-Agency Coordination: Systematic Government Apparatus Weaponization",
  "description": "Research how the White House Iraq Group systematically coordinated across multiple government agencies to weaponize executive branch apparatus for partisan political objectives. Investigate coordination between WHIG, Office of Special Plans, Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and regulatory agencies to create comprehensive institutional capture mechanisms. Document how WHIG transformed disparate government functions into coordinated partisan political weapons, establishing systematic mechanisms for executive branch weaponization that violated separation of powers and created precedents for ongoing institutional abuse.",
