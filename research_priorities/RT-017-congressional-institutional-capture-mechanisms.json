  "title": "Congressional Institutional Capture Mechanisms: Expansion from WHIG Deception to Systematic Legislative Manipulation",
  "description": "Research the systematic expansion of congressional manipulation beyond WHIG's Iraq War deception campaigns, documenting the creation of permanent institutional mechanisms enabling systematic legislative capture from 2001-2017. Investigate the transformation from episodic executive deception of Congress to systematic congressional institutional capture through lobbying infrastructure expansion, campaign finance manipulation, revolving door personnel placement, committee capture mechanisms, and legislative process corruption. Document constitutional violations including: systematic undermining of congressional oversight responsibilities, legislative deliberation corrupted through institutional capture, separation of powers violated through systematic executive manipulation, democratic representation corrupted through corporate capture of legislative processes, and constitutional checks and balances systematically bypassed through institutional design. Examine how WHIG's successful congressional deception provided the template for broader systematic congressional institutional capture, creating permanent infrastructure enabling rapid policy implementation regardless of democratic opposition or constitutional constraints.",
