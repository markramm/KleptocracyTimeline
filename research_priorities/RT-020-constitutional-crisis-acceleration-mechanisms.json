  "title": "Constitutional Crisis Acceleration Mechanisms: From Systematic Capture to Rapid Crisis Exploitation (2017-2025)",
  "description": "Research the systematic acceleration of constitutional crisis mechanisms from 2017-2025, documenting how the institutional capture infrastructure created through WHIG expansion, Powell Memorandum implementation, and corporate-state fusion enabled rapid systematic constitutional breakdown during crisis periods. Investigate the transformation from gradual institutional capture to systematic rapid crisis exploitation through emergency power abuse, constitutional norm destruction, systematic rule of law undermining, democratic institution systematic attack, and constitutional constraint rapid elimination. Document constitutional violations including: systematic abuse of emergency powers to bypass constitutional constraints, democratic institutions systematically attacked through coordinated assault, rule of law systematically undermined through institutional capture exploitation, constitutional norms systematically destroyed through crisis acceleration, and democratic accountability systematically eliminated through rapid institutional transformation. Examine how decades of systematic institutional capture created infrastructure enabling rapid constitutional crisis acceleration, demonstrating how gradual democratic erosion creates conditions for systematic constitutional collapse during crisis periods.",
