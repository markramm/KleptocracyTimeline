  "description": "Research the White House Iraq Group's systematic patterns of retaliation against intelligence professionals, journalists, and government officials who challenged WMD propaganda. Investigate WHIG coordination in targeting Joseph Wilson, Richard Clarke, Paul O'Neill, and other administration critics, institutional mechanisms for orchestrating character assassination campaigns, coordination between WHIG retaliation and broader administration intimidation tactics, and evolution from propaganda creation to active punishment of dissent. Document how WHIG became the institutional center for weaponizing government power against truthtellers and critics.",
