  "title": "WHIG Template Implementation in Trump Administration Constitutional Crisis Acceleration and Oligarchic Capture",
  "description": "Research how Trump administration systematically implemented and accelerated WHIG constitutional crisis precedents and Powell-WHIG template coordination patterns to achieve rapid oligarchic capture of democratic institutions. Investigate how WHIG precedents for executive immunity, congressional deception, media coordination, intelligence manipulation, and constitutional bypass provided institutional framework enabling Trump administration's systematic acceleration of democratic transformation. Document how established WHIG-Powell template for crisis-accelerated institutional capture enabled Trump administration to exploit manufactured and genuine crisis conditions for unprecedented systematic capture of democratic institutions. Connect WHIG constitutional crisis precedent establishment to Trump administration's systematic implementation of oligarchic governance through established institutional capture infrastructure.",
