  "description": "Research the systematic implementation of Project 2025's constitutional transformation agenda through radical expansion of presidential power, elimination of civil service protections via Schedule F, and replacement of merit-based governance with political loyalty tests. Investigate how Trump administration implemented 70% of Project 2025 recommendations within 7 months despite public disavowals, the appointment of 18+ Project 2025 authors to senior positions including OMB Director Russell Vought, and the systematic elimination of oversight mechanisms. Document constitutional violations including: elimination of 50,000 civil service positions, complete dismantling of DEI programs, mass firing of inspectors general, loyalty testing regimes requiring MAGA essay submissions, and deployment of 'MAGA commissars' throughout federal agencies to monitor political compliance.",
