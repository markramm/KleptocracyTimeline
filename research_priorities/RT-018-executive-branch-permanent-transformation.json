  "title": "Executive Branch Permanent Transformation: WHIG Tactics Institutionalized Across Government (2001-2021)",
  "description": "Research the systematic transformation of executive branch operations through institutionalization of WHIG tactics across multiple administrations from 2001-2021, documenting how temporary propaganda coordination became permanent executive power expansion. Investigate the transformation from constitutional executive constraint to systematic presidential power accumulation through signing statement abuse, executive order expansion, agency politicization, personnel loyalty testing, and constitutional oversight circumvention. Document constitutional violations including: systematic expansion of executive power beyond constitutional limits, presidential authority expanded through institutional design rather than constitutional amendment, separation of powers systematically violated through executive agency politicization, constitutional appointment processes corrupted through loyalty testing, and democratic accountability systematically bypassed through executive branch transformation. Examine how WHIG's successful institutional coordination provided the template for permanent executive branch transformation, creating systematic presidential power expansion that survives electoral transitions and constitutional constraints.",
