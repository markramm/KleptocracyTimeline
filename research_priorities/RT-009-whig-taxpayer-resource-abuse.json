  "description": "Research how the White House Iraq Group systematically abused taxpayer-funded government resources, facilities, and staff time to conduct what was essentially a political campaign for war authorization. Investigate use of Situation Room for propaganda planning meetings, deployment of government communications staff for partisan messaging activities, utilization of Air Force One and government aircraft for propaganda distribution, and coordination between official government business and partisan political objectives. Document violations of laws prohibiting use of government resources for political activities and the transformation of executive branch apparatus into a partisan war marketing operation.",
