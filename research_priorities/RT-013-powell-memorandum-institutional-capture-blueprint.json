  "title": "Powell Memorandum Blueprint: Systematic Corporate Capture of Democratic Institutions",
  "description": "Research the implementation of Lewis Powell's 1971 blueprint for systematic institutional capture that fundamentally altered American democracy through coordinated corporate takeover of universities, media, courts, and government. Investigate Powell's four-pillar strategy: intellectual infrastructure capture through think tanks and academia, legal capture through the Federalist Society and corporate-funded litigation, media capture through parallel conservative infrastructure, and political integration through revolving door mechanisms. Document constitutional violations including: systematic judicial capture threatening separation of powers, corporate funding of academic research undermining independent scholarship, media platform coordination influencing democratic discourse, and revolving door corruption creating institutionalized conflicts of interest. Examine how Powell's 50-year implementation timeline created the infrastructure later exploited for rapid crisis-driven institutional transformation.",
