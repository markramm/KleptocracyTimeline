  "description": "Research the systematic coordination between the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans (OSP) and the White House Iraq Group in manufacturing and disseminating fabricated intelligence about Iraqi WMD capabilities. Investigate Douglas Feith's role in connecting OSP products to WHIG messaging, coordination meetings between Pentagon and White House staff, transformation of OSP raw intelligence manipulation into WHIG public messaging, and institutional mechanisms bypassing traditional intelligence vetting. Document how this inter-agency conspiracy created a parallel intelligence apparatus designed to justify predetermined war policy.",
