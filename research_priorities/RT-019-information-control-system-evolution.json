  "title": "Information Control System Evolution: From WHIG Coordination to Systematic Information Warfare (2002-2025)",
  "description": "Research the systematic evolution of information control systems from WHIG's episodic media coordination to comprehensive information warfare infrastructure spanning 2002-2025, documenting the transformation from temporary propaganda campaigns to permanent systematic control of democratic information processes. Investigate the expansion from traditional media coordination to digital platform manipulation, algorithmic information control, social media weaponization, search result manipulation, and systematic deployment of artificial intelligence for information warfare. Document constitutional violations including: systematic manipulation of democratic discourse through algorithmic control, First Amendment violations through systematic information suppression, equal access to information corrupted through platform manipulation, democratic decision-making processes systematically compromised through information warfare, and constitutional democratic participation corrupted through systematic information control. Examine how WHIG's successful media coordination provided the template for comprehensive information control systems that now systematically manipulate democratic processes through technological infrastructure enabling rapid information warfare deployment.",
