  "description": "Research the systematic mechanisms by which the White House Iraq Group coordinated with major television networks to disseminate synchronized propaganda messages. Investigate pre-arranged appearances, talking point distribution systems, network executive meetings, and the infrastructure that enabled coordinated Sunday show blitzes like September 8, 2002. Document how WHIG transformed disparate media outlets into a unified propaganda apparatus through institutional relationships and advance coordination.",
