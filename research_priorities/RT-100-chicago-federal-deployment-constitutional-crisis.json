  "description": "Research the constitutional crisis emerging from Trump's threats to deploy National Guard to Chicago, including 'Chipocalypse Now' propaganda, Operation Midway Blitz immigration raids, state resistance mechanisms, and the Posse Comitatus Act violations. Document the parallel tracks of military threats as political theater while civilian immigration enforcement proceeds, Naval Station Great Lakes militarization, and precedent-setting federal court rulings blocking military deployments.",
