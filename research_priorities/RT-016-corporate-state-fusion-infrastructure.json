  "title": "Corporate State Fusion Infrastructure: Systematic Government-Corporate Integration Beyond Media Coordination",
  "description": "Research the systematic expansion of government-corporate coordination infrastructure beyond WHIG's media operations, documenting the creation of permanent institutional mechanisms enabling seamless corporate-government integration from 2001 to present. Investigate the transformation from episodic corporate-government cooperation to systematic fusion through revolving door institutionalization, regulatory capture mechanisms, public-private partnership structures, and corporate penetration of government decision-making processes. Document constitutional violations including: systematic corporate capture of regulatory agencies, public resources transferred to private corporate control, democratic accountability circumvented through private sector integration, constitutional appointment processes bypassed through contractor relationships, and public interest subordinated to corporate profit through institutional design. Examine how WHIG's successful corporate media coordination provided the template for broader systematic corporate capture of government functions, creating permanent infrastructure enabling rapid corporate-directed policy implementation regardless of electoral outcomes.",
