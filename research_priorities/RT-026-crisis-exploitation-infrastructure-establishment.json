  "title": "Crisis Exploitation Infrastructure Establishment: Pre-Crisis Preparation for Systematic Institutional Capture",
  "description": "Research how the Bush administration systematically established crisis exploitation infrastructure during 2001-2002 period before Iraq War propaganda campaign, demonstrating coordinated preparation for systematic institutional capture through manufactured crisis conditions. Investigate how oversight destruction (Valentine's Day Massacre), alternative coordination networks (Faith-Based Initiatives), intelligence community capture, and media coordination protocols were established as systematic preparation for crisis-accelerated institutional transformation. Document how pre-crisis infrastructure establishment enables rapid systematic capture during declared emergency conditions, providing template for ongoing oligarchic capture through manufactured or exploited crises. Connect to Powell Memorandum implementation acceleration and WHIG operational success patterns.",
