# Agent Guidelines - Analysis Directory

## üéØ Purpose
Pattern analysis, findings, and intelligence derived from timeline data.

## üìÅ Contents

### Key Documents
- **PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive analysis of 9 capture lanes
- **CAPTURE_LANES.md** - Detailed capture mechanism definitions
- Additional analysis documents as created

## üìä Analysis Standards

### Data-Driven Conclusions
Every claim must be:
1. **Sourced** from timeline events
2. **Quantified** where possible
3. **Reproducible** by others
4. **Transparent** about methodology

### Pattern Recognition Guidelines

#### Valid Patterns
- Same actors across multiple events
- Temporal clustering of related events
- Financial flows between entities
- Recurring tactics or strategies
- Acceleration/deceleration trends

#### Invalid Patterns
- Correlation without evidence
- Speculation beyond data
- Partisan interpretations
- Conspiracy without documentation

## üîç Analysis Methodologies

### Temporal Analysis
```python
# Example: Find acceleration patterns
def analyze_acceleration(events_by_year):
    for year in sorted(events_by_year.keys()):
        count = len(events_by_year[year])
        if year > min(events_by_year.keys()):
            prev_count = len(events_by_year[year-1])
            growth = (count - prev_count) / prev_count * 100
            print(f"{year}: {count} events ({growth:+.1f}% change)")
```

### Network Analysis
```python
# Example: Find connected actors
def find_actor_networks(events):
    from collections import defaultdict
    connections = defaultdict(set)
    
    for event in events:
        actors = event.get('actors', [])
        for i, actor1 in enumerate(actors):
            for actor2 in actors[i+1:]:
                connections[actor1].add(actor2)
                connections[actor2].add(actor1)
    
    return connections
```

### Financial Analysis
```python
# Example: Track money flows
def track_financial_flows(events):
    flows = []
    for event in events:
        if 'financial' in event.get('tags', []):
            amount = extract_amount(event['summary'])
            if amount:
                flows.append({
                    'date': event['date'],
                    'amount': amount,
                    'actors': event.get('actors', []),
                    'type': categorize_transaction(event)
                })
    return flows
```

   - Or theoretical framework

2. **Data Extraction**
   ```python
   relevant_events = [e for e in events if matches_criteria(e)]
   ```

3. **Pattern Testing**
   - Statistical significance
   - Temporal consistency
   - Cross-validation

4. **Documentation**

   - Findings
   - Limitations
   - Implications

### Trend Analysis
1. **Select Timeframe**
2. **Extract Relevant Events**
3. **Calculate Metrics**
4. **Identify Inflection Points**
5. **Project Forward** (with caveats)

### Network Mapping
1. **Identify Entities**
2. **Extract Relationships**
3. **Calculate Centrality**
4. **Visualize Network**
5. **Identify Key Nodes**

### Language
- **Precise**: Use exact numbers
- **Cautious**: "Suggests" not "proves"
- **Clear**: Avoid jargon
- **Honest**: State limitations

### Citations
- Reference specific events by ID
- Link to timeline entries
- Quote sources directly
- Provide reproducible queries

## üö® Quality Checks

### Before Publishing Analysis
1. **Data Accuracy**: All numbers verified
2. **Methodology Clear**: Others can reproduce
3. **Limitations Stated**: What we don't know
4. **Sources Cited**: Every claim backed
5. **Peer Review**: Second opinion if possible

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Extrapolating beyond data
- Ignoring contradictory events
- Overstating confidence
- Political bias in interpretation
