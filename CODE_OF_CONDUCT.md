# Code of Conduct - Kleptocracy Timeline

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Kleptocracy Timeline project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on documenting and understanding threats to democratic governance.

## Our Standards

* **Rigorous sourcing** - Providing verifiable sources for all claims
* **Factual accuracy** - Prioritizing truth over sensationalism
* **Respectful disagreement** - Engaging in constructive debate about interpretations
* **Collaborative verification** - Working together to validate events
* **Pattern recognition** - Identifying systemic issues without partisan bias
* **Gracefully accepting** constructive criticism and corrections
* **Focusing on** documented actions rather than partisan politics
* **Supporting** new contributors with patience and clarity

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* **Fabricating** events or sources
* **Partisan attacks** or politically motivated harassment
* **Spreading** misinformation or unverified claims
* **Doxxing** or publishing others' private information
* **Trolling**, insulting, or derogatory comments
* **Public or private** harassment of any kind
* **Dismissing** documented evidence without justification

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository and issues
- Substack comments and discussions
- Social media discussions about the project
- Any other forums where the community gathers

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:
- GitHub Issues (for public matters)
- Direct message to maintainers (for sensitive matters)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for This Project

Given the nature of documenting democratic erosion and corruption:

### We Encourage:
- **Brave documentation** of difficult truths
- **Protection of sources** and whistleblowers
- **Careful verification** of sensitive claims
- **Academic rigor** in analysis
- **International perspectives** on democratic norms

### We Prohibit:
- **Conspiracy theories** without documentation
- **Calls for violence** or illegal action
- **Harassment of** public figures beyond factual documentation
- **Partisan propaganda** disguised as analysis
- **Foreign interference** or coordinated inauthentic behavior
