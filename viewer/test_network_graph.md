## Evaluation Results

### Strengths ✅
1. **Effective Filtering**: Multiple filter types work well together
2. **Good Default View**: 30 nodes/6 months is manageable
3. **Interactive Legend**: Category filtering is intuitive
4. **Search Highlighting**: Red borders help find nodes quickly
5. **Reset Function**: Easy to start over
6. **Importance Field**: Provides consistent prioritization
7. **Tooltips**: Quick info without clicking

### Weaknesses ❌
1. **Layout Instability**: Force simulation keeps moving
2. **Label Overlap**: Text overlaps at higher densities
3. **Limited Layouts**: Only force-directed works (timeline/circular not implemented)
4. **No Export**: Can't save or share graph state
5. **No Event Grouping**: Can't collapse related events
6. **Color Accessibility**: May be hard for colorblind users
7. **Mobile Experience**: Controls take too much space on small screens

### Usability Score: 7.5/10

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Stabilize Layout**: Add "freeze" button to stop animation
2. **Implement Timeline Layout**: Chronological view would be very useful
3. **Add URL State**: Save filter state in URL for sharing
4. **Export Function**: SVG/PNG export for reports
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Arrow keys to navigate between nodes

### Medium Priority
1. **Cluster View**: Group events by month/year
2. **Path Finding**: Show shortest path between two events/actors
3. **Better Mobile Layout**: Collapsible controls
4. **Color Blind Mode**: Patterns or shapes instead of colors
5. **Event Preview**: Hover for full summary

### Low Priority
1. **Animation Controls**: Slow/fast/pause simulation
2. **Custom Categories**: User-defined groupings
3. **Statistics Panel**: Show graph metrics
4. **History**: Undo/redo for exploration
5. **Preset Views**: Save common filter combinations

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Journalist researching Trump-Epstein connections
**Process**: 
1. Search "Epstein"
2. Filter actor "Donald Trump"
3. Set time range to "All Time"
**Result**: Focused view of their relationship timeline

### Scenario 2: Analyst tracking recent constitutional threats
**Process**:
1. Filter tag "constitutional-crisis"
2. Set time range "Last 6 months"
3. Increase nodes to 50
**Result**: Comprehensive view of recent threats

### Scenario 3: Researcher studying financial crimes
**Process**:
1. Click Financial + Criminal categories
2. Search "money"
3. Look at connections
**Result**: Network of financial crime patterns

## Conclusion

The NetworkGraph component is **functional and useful** for exploring relationships in the timeline data. The addition of search, filters, and the importance field significantly improves usability compared to showing all 332 events at once.

**Key Success**: The combination of importance-based filtering with search and category selection allows users to quickly drill down to relevant information.

**Main Limitation**: The force-directed layout, while visually appealing, can be disorienting with constant movement. A timeline layout would complement this well.

**Overall Assessment**: Good foundation for network analysis with room for enhancement. The tool effectively reveals patterns and connections that would be hard to see in a linear timeline.
