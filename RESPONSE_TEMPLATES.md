### Requesting More Information

#### Need Additional Sources
```markdown
Thanks for your submission! To meet our verification standards, we need at least 2 credible sources for each event.

```

### Declining Submissions

#### Insufficient Sources
```markdown
Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, we cannot add this event without adequate source verification.

Our standards require at least 2 credible sources that directly confirm the event. Social media posts or unverified claims cannot be used as primary sources.

If you can find additional credible sources (news outlets, government documents, court filings), please feel free to resubmit.

See our [FAQ](FAQ.md#what-sources-are-acceptable) for more on source requirements.
```

#### Duplicate Event
```markdown
Thank you for your submission! This event is already documented in the timeline as:

Event ID: `[existing-event-id]`
Link: [direct link to event]

If you have additional sources or corrections for the existing event, please feel free to submit those.

Thanks for helping to ensure comprehensive coverage!
```

#### Outside Scope
```markdown
Thank you for your submission. While this information is concerning, it falls outside the timeline's scope of documenting systematic democratic erosion and institutional capture.

We focus on events that show patterns of:
- Judicial, electoral, or media capture
- Regulatory dismantling
- Financial corruption with institutional impact
- Executive overreach
- Other systematic erosion of democratic norms

For more on our criteria, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
