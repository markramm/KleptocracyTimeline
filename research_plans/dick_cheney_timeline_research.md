## Questions for Further Investigation

4. How did Cheney's philosophy influence the Trump administration despite his opposition?

## Conclusion

Dick Cheney's career represents perhaps the most successful accumulation and exercise of executive power in modern American history. From congressional staffer to de facto co-president, his trajectory through the revolving door of government and industry established patterns that persist today. His recent break with Trump represents not a change in philosophy but a defense of institutional power against populist disruption.

The timeline reveals how one individual can reshape American governance through patient accumulation of positions, careful network building, and aggressive interpretation of constitutional powers. His legacy includes normalized torture, expanded surveillance, perpetual war, and the blueprint for executive overreach that subsequent administrations have followed.

Priority should be given to documenting the specific mechanisms of power accumulation and the financial networks that enabled and profited from his policies.
