# UX Improvement Plan - Static-First Approach

## 🎯 Core Constraint: 100% Static, No Server Required

All improvements must work with static JSON files and client-side JavaScript only.

## Phase 1: Core Usability (Week 1-2)
*Fix what's broken, enhance what exists*

### 1.1 Timeline View Improvements

- [ ] **Graph Layouts**
  - Force-directed (default)
  - Chronological (left-to-right by date)
  - Hierarchical (tree structure)
  - Circular (actors in circle, events in center)

### 2.2 Grid View Implementation
- [ ] **Card-Based Layout**
  - Masonry grid (Pinterest-style)
  - Card size based on importance
  - Color coding by category
  - Image thumbnails where available
  
- [ ] **Card Features**
  - Quick preview on hover
  - Flip animation for details
  - Badge indicators (New, Verified, Needs Review)
  - Related events count

### 2.3 Data Export & Sharing
- [ ] **Export Formats** (all client-side generation)
  - Download as JSON
  - Export to CSV
  - Generate markdown report
  - Create timeline image (canvas-based)
  
- [ ] **Sharing Features**
  - Custom share links with filters
  - Embed code generator
  - Social media cards (Open Graph tags)
  - QR code for mobile sharing

### 2.4 Offline Support
- [ ] **Progressive Web App**
  - Service worker for offline access
  - Cache JSON data locally
  - IndexedDB for user preferences
  - "Add to Home Screen" prompt
  
- [ ] **Local Storage Features**
  - Save favorite events
  - Remember last view/filters
  - Store search history
  - Offline indicator

### 2.5 Accessibility & Customization
- [ ] **Accessibility**
  - ARIA labels throughout
  - Keyboard navigation for all features
  - High contrast mode toggle
  - Reduce motion option
  - Screen reader announcements
  
- [ ] **User Preferences** (localStorage)
  - Theme selection (Light/Dark/High Contrast)
  - Default view (Timeline/List/Grid/Graph)
  - Data density (Compact/Comfortable/Spacious)
  - Preferred date format
  - Auto-play animations on/off

### 2.6 Pattern Detection (Client-Side)
- [ ] **Simple Pattern Analysis**
  - Event clustering by date
  - Actor collaboration frequency
  - Tag co-occurrence matrix
  - Temporal patterns (weekly/monthly trends)
  
- [ ] **Visual Pattern Indicators**
  - "Unusual activity" badges
  - Connection strength visualization
  - Trend arrows for increasing activity
  - Pattern comparison tool

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements (If Successful)
*Server-based features for later consideration*

- AI-powered search and insights
- Real-time collaborative investigation boards
- User accounts and saved investigations  
- Backend API for complex queries
- WebSocket updates for live events
- Machine learning pattern detection
- Natural language query interface
- VR/AR timeline exploration
