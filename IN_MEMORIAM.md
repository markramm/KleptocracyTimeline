# In Memoriam

This project is dedicated to the memory of the journalists, researchers, and whistleblowers who have paid the ultimate price in the pursuit of truth and the fight against corruption. Their work often involves exposing the very networks of power documented in this timeline. Their courage is the reason this project must be open, decentralized, and resilient, so that the work may always continue.

This list is tragically incomplete. To honor others who have lost their lives, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
