            "value": "Charles Keating, through American Continental Corporation, purchases Lincoln Savings and Loan for $51 million in February 1984. By employing deceptive accounting practices, Keating rapidly inflated Lincoln's reported assets from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion within four years. He systematically invested two-thirds of federally insured deposits in high-risk junk bonds and engaged in fraudulent land trade practices. Keating strategically distributed $1.5 million in campaign contributions to five U.S. Senators (the \"Keating Five\"), who subsequently pressured regulators to overlook Lincoln's suspicious activities, demonstrating a sophisticated mechanism of regulatory capture across legislative and financial sectors."
