# The Kleptocratic Playbook: A Seven-Part Investigation
## How America's Anti-Corruption Reforms Created the Infrastructure for Global Kleptocracy

### Series Overview
This investigation reveals how a unified kleptocratic playbook has systematically undermined democratic institutions worldwide. Drawing from extensive documentary evidence, government reports, and court records, we trace how American corporate capture strategies, exported globally, were weaponized back against Western democracy itself.
