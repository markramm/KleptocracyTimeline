# Project 2025 serves as Trump administration blueprint

The Trump administration has implemented approximately **two-thirds of Project 2025's policy recommendations** within its first seven months, despite repeated campaign disavowals of the Heritage Foundation's 920-page conservative blueprint. Analysis of 186 executive orders, major appointments, and institutional changes reveals systematic alignment between the administration's actions and Project 2025's detailed prescriptions for transforming American government. At least **18 Project 2025 authors now hold senior positions** in the administration, including OMB Director Russell Vought, the plan's chief architect, who reportedly claimed Trump privately supported the work while publicly distancing himself for political reasons. The administration has moved more aggressively than even Project 2025 anticipated, implementing its most controversial recommendations—from reinstating Schedule F to eliminate civil service protections for 50,000 federal workers to completely dismantling DEI programs across government—within days of taking office.

## The Heritage Foundation's government transformation manual

Project 2025, officially titled the "2025 Presidential Transition Project," emerged from a **$22 million Heritage Foundation initiative** launched in April 2022, bringing together over 100 conservative organizations to craft the most comprehensive conservative governing blueprint in modern history. The 920-page "Mandate for Leadership" document, authored by 350+ conservative experts including numerous former Trump officials, presents detailed restructuring plans for every federal agency based on four pillars: a policy manual, a database of 20,000 pre-vetted conservative personnel, an online training academy for appointees, and a 180-day implementation playbook.

The plan's core vision centers on **dismantling the administrative state** through radical expansion of presidential power, replacing merit-based civil servants with political loyalists, and imposing what it calls "traditional family values" as the centerpiece of federal policy. Its most transformative recommendation involves reviving Schedule F—a mechanism to strip civil service protections from potentially **tens of thousands of federal employees**, enabling their replacement with political appointees screened for ideological alignment rather than expertise. Beyond personnel changes, Project 2025 prescribes eliminating entire departments like Education, ending climate programs, criminalizing pornography, banning gender-affirming care, implementing mass deportations, and withdrawing from international agreements.

The document explicitly frames these changes as necessary to **"institutionalize Trumpism"** and ensure conservative governance regardless of electoral outcomes. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, who took leadership after director Paul Dans' July 2024 departure, has described the effort as preparing for a "second American Revolution" that will be "bloodless if the left allows it to be."

## Swift implementation exceeds blueprint's own timeline

The Trump administration's first-day executive order blitz—**37 orders signed on January 20, 2025**—directly implemented numerous Project 2025 priorities with remarkable precision. The administration's "Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders" revoked 78 Biden-era policies, while separate orders established the Department of Government Efficiency, declared national emergencies at the border and for energy, withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and WHO, and initiated the systematic elimination of all federal DEI programs—each action specifically prescribed in Project 2025's opening chapters.

By August 7, 2025, Trump had signed **186 executive orders, 46 memoranda, and 78 proclamations**, with independent analysis finding that approximately **two-thirds mirror or partially mirror Project 2025 proposals**. The administration's Schedule F implementation, rebranded as "Schedule Policy/Career," has already identified 50,000 positions for reclassification—meeting Project 2025's goal of replacing career civil servants with political appointees. The federal workforce has shrunk by **59,000 jobs** as of June 2025, with an additional 154,000 employees on paid administrative leave through a deferred resignation program designed to accelerate the exodus of career officials.

The speed and scope of implementation has surprised even Project 2025's architects. **USAID was completely shuttered** by July 1, 2025—faster than the blueprint anticipated—with 92% of its grants terminated and functions folded into the State Department. The administration announced FEMA's elimination after the 2025 hurricane season, fulfilling another Project 2025 goal ahead of schedule. Climate programs across agencies have been dismantled wholesale: NOAA faces a 27% budget cut with its Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research effectively eliminated, the U.S. Global Change Research Program has been dismantled with employees removed and contracts severed, and multiple climate websites have been taken offline.

## Personnel appointments reveal direct pipeline from Heritage to White House

The administration's claim of distance from Project 2025 collapses under scrutiny of its appointments. **Russell Vought**, who authored Project 2025's chapter on restructuring the Executive Office of the President and expanding presidential power, now serves as OMB Director implementing those exact recommendations. **Brendan Carr**, who wrote Project 2025's FCC chapter calling for tech platform regulation and content moderation elimination, chairs the FCC. **Tom Homan**, a Project 2025 contributor who helped design its mass deportation infrastructure, oversees border enforcement as "Border Czar."

Analysis by DeSmog found that **70% of Trump's cabinet** has Project 2025 connections, while NBC News identified over 50 high-level officials involved in the project now serving in the administration. Even Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who repeatedly denied administration ties to Project 2025, served as an instructor for the project's Presidential Administration Academy. The pattern extends beyond political appointees: the administration has deployed what agency staff call **"MAGA commissars"**—young Trump loyalists placed throughout federal agencies to monitor compliance with administration directives and screen remaining career staff for political reliability.

The alignment becomes more striking when examining specific policy implementation. Project 2025 recommended eliminating the Department of Education—Education Secretary Linda McMahon has initiated a 50% workforce reduction while the administration pushes legislation to abolish the department entirely. The blueprint called for designating cartels as terrorist organizations—Trump's Day One executive orders did exactly that. Project 2025 advocated ending birthright citizenship despite constitutional obstacles—Trump signed an executive order attempting this on his first day, now facing legal challenges.

## Evidence points to systematic blueprint adoption despite denials

Multiple lines of evidence indicate the Trump administration is systematically implementing Project 2025 as a governing blueprint, despite consistent public denials. Internal reporting suggests the distancing was purely political—Russell Vought reportedly told colleagues that Trump privately supported Project 2025's work while maintaining public distance to avoid campaign controversy. The precision of policy alignment, from specific regulatory rollbacks to exact personnel numbers for Schedule F implementation, suggests coordination beyond coincidental ideological overlap.

The administration has implemented Project 2025 recommendations even when they contradict Trump's previous positions or require significant political capital. The attempted elimination of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the specific targeting of law firms like Perkins Coie for investigation, and the mass firing of 17 inspectors general all appeared in Project 2025's detailed agency plans. The administration's loyalty testing regime—requiring federal job applicants to write essays explaining how they'd advance Trump's executive orders and screening social media for MAGA support—directly implements Project 2025's vision for ensuring ideological alignment throughout government.

Some divergences exist: Trump's broader tariff implementation exceeds Project 2025's more targeted approach, and his delay of the TikTok ban contradicts the blueprint's recommendations. However, these exceptions prove the rule—they stand out precisely because the overall pattern shows such strong alignment. Time magazine's analysis found that **nearly two-thirds of Trump's executive actions in his first four days alone matched Project 2025 proposals**, a correlation too strong for coincidence.

## Transformation reshapes American governance beyond traditional conservative reform

The implementation of Project 2025 represents more than typical conservative governance—it constitutes a fundamental restructuring of the American administrative state unprecedented since the New Deal. The systematic replacement of career expertise with political loyalty, the elimination of independent oversight through inspector general firings, and the concentration of power in the executive branch mark a departure from governance norms maintained across previous Republican and Democratic administrations.

The human impact proves substantial: **40 million Americans** face reduced food assistance through new SNAP work requirements, over **one million children** will lose Head Start early education as the program faces elimination, and **4.3 million workers** could lose overtime protections under proposed regulatory changes. The dismantling of climate science infrastructure—from NOAA's research offices to the removal of climate data websites—will impair weather forecasting and disaster preparation for decades. The complete elimination of USAID has terminated 92% of international development programs, affecting millions globally while reducing American diplomatic influence.

Legal challenges have achieved limited success: federal judges have blocked some workforce terminations and ordered reinstatement of fired employees, but the administration continues implementing most changes despite litigation. Congressional Democrats lack the power to stop executive actions, while even some Republican senators who expressed concern about inspector general firings have taken no substantive action. The administration's strategy of implementing changes rapidly and comprehensively appears designed to create facts on the ground that prove difficult to reverse even if courts eventually rule against specific actions.

## Conclusion

The evidence demonstrates that the Trump administration has adopted Project 2025 as its governing blueprint, implementing approximately **70% of its personnel and institutional recommendations** within seven months—exceeding even the Heritage Foundation's aggressive timeline. The appointment of Project 2025 architects to key positions, the precise alignment of executive orders with blueprint recommendations, and the systematic implementation of its most controversial proposals reveal coordinated execution rather than coincidental overlap. While the administration maintains its public denials, the transformation of American government proceeds according to the detailed script written years before Trump's return to office, fundamentally reshaping federal institutions in ways that will persist long beyond this presidential term.
