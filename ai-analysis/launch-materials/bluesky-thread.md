Launched today: An interactive timeline documenting 395 events of democratic capture from 1970-2025.

Every event sourced. Every pattern visible. Every connection mapped.

The acceleration is terrifying: 1 event/year in 1970s â†’ 162 events/year in 2025

Built this because I was drowning in news but starving for understanding. Every day brought new outrages but no framework for comprehension.

So I started mapping it. 395 events later, the patterns are undeniable.

**Post 3**
Key findings:
- 9 parallel capture operations running simultaneously
- Same 47 actors across 100+ events over 20 years
- $700M+ in documented suspicious transactions
- Each crisis enables 3.5x more capture events
- We're in exponential acceleration

**Post 4**
The 9 capture lanes:
1. Judicial ($6.6M in "gifts" to justices)
2. Financial ($700M in shell transactions)
3. Foreign (Russian money at every crisis)
4. Information (platform capture)
5. Executive (emergencyâ†’permanent)
6. Federal workforce (loyalty purges)
7. Corporate (industry writing laws)
8. Elections (surgical voter suppression)
9. Constitutional (systematic dismantling)

**Post 5**
The Powell Memo (1971) wasn't a suggestionâ€”it was a blueprint. The timeline shows how it's been implemented step by step for 54 years.

What seemed like random corruption was coordinated strategy. What felt like chaos was careful planning.

Most revealing: The network visualization.

Same people. Same money. Different scandals. Over and over. For decades.

The timeline makes the invisible visible. Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.

**Post 7**
The financial networks are staggering. Same period Trump got $700M in cash purchases through shells, Epstein moved $300M through banks that paid $10B in Russian laundering fines.

Every transaction documented. Every connection mapped. All sources public.

This is open source intelligence for democratic defense:

âœ“ All code on GitHub
âœ“ All data public (CC BY-SA)
âœ“ All sources verifiable
âœ“ Community validation system
âœ“ Anyone can contribute

Democracy requires transparency. Resistance requires infrastructure.

**Post 9**
You can:
- Filter by any of the 9 capture lanes
- Search for specific actors or events
- See network connections between events
- Share individual events with unique URLs
- Track patterns in real-time as events unfold

The acceleration pattern is what keeps me up at night:

Exponential curves have a terrible property: they look manageable until suddenly they don't. By the time everyone sees it, it's almost too late.

We're at the steep part of the curve now.

**Post 11**
This isn't about left or right. It's about the systematic capture of democratic institutions by kleptocratic networks.

It's about making the invisible visible so citizens can make informed decisions.

It's about pattern recognition as a tool for prediction and preparation.

Help needed:
- Validate events (every event needs verification)
- Submit new documented events  
- Identify patterns I've missed
- Share specific events relevant to your community
- Contribute code/features

I'll be publishing The Capture Cascade Series - a deep dive into how democracy falls not gradually, but exponentially.

We'll trace the pattern from the Powell Memo to today's open kleptocracy.

Follow for updates. This is just the beginning.

**Post 14**
Why this matters: Those destroying democracy depend on our inability to see patterns. On exhaustion. On information overflow preventing comprehension.

This timeline is memory. It's pattern recognition. It's evidence.

Use it. Share it. Improve it.

## Follow-Up Posts

### Visual Post (with screenshot)
"The network view is absolutely wild. You can literally see the same money flowing through different channels over decades.

It's like watching corruption in slow motion, except it's speeding up.

### Data Deep Dive
"Scariest graph from the timeline:

[Exponential curve screenshot]

That vertical line at the end? That's where we are now. 

Exponential functions are patient until they're not."

### Pattern Recognition
"Pattern from the timeline that haunts me:

Every financial crisis is followed by a wave of regulatory capture. The capture then enables the next crisis. Which enables more capture.

It's a doom loop, and we're accelerating through it."

### Community Call
"The timeline is already revealing patterns I didn't expect. Community members are finding connections between events I never would have seen.

This is what distributed intelligence gathering looks like. This is how we build collective understanding."

## Engagement Strategy

### Reply to Questions:
"Great question! [Direct answer with specific link to filtered timeline view]. The timeline lets you explore that exact pattern."

### Reply to Skeptics:
"Totally understand the skepticism. That's why every single event has multiple sources - court docs, financial records, verified reporting. No speculation, just documentation. Check any event's sources."

### Reply to Supporters:
"Thank you! Best way to help is to explore the timeline and share specific events that resonate. Also, we need people to validate events - every verification strengthens the record."

### Reply to Suggestions:
"Excellent idea! Can you open an issue on GitHub? The project is community-driven and we're actively adding features based on user needs."
