Democracy doesn't fall gradually. It cascades.

Each captured institution enables 3 more captures. The math is terrifying.

1970s: 1 event/year
2020: 67/year
2025: 200+/year

790 documented events. The pattern is undeniable.

The Capture Cascade works like this:

1. Capture oversight ‚Üí No one watching
2. Capture courts ‚Üí No legal recourse
3. Capture enforcement ‚Üí Selective prosecution
4. Capture media ‚Üí Public blind
5. Each enables 3 more ‚Üí Exponential growth

Once started, it's nearly impossible to stop.

The timeline revealed 9 "capture lanes" operating simultaneously:

üìä Financial: $700M in shell companies
‚öñÔ∏è Judicial: $6.6M in "gifts" to justices
üåç Foreign: Russian money at every crisis
üì± Information: Platform capture
üèõÔ∏è Executive: Emergency ‚Üí permanent

Most chilling discovery: The acceleration pattern

1970-1980: 10 events total
1980-1990: 15 events
1990-2000: 22 events
2000-2010: 31 events
2010-2020: 67 events
2020-2024: 142 events
2025 (8 mo): 200+ events

Exponential curves have terrible properties.

The financial networks are staggering:

Same period Trump received $700M in cash purchases through shells, Epstein moved $300M through same banks that paid $10B in Russian laundering fines.

Every transaction documented. Every connection mapped.

This started with the Powell Memo in 1971 - a literal blueprint for corporate capture of democracy.

The timeline shows how that blueprint has been followed, step by step, for 54 years.

What seemed like random events were coordinated strategy.

**Tweet 7**
The network visualization is revealing:

Same people. Same money. Different scandals.
Over and over. For decades.

Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.

This is open source intelligence for democratic defense:

‚úì All code public
‚úì All data public  
‚úì All sources verifiable
‚úì Community validation
‚úì Anyone can contribute

Democracy requires transparency. Resistance requires infrastructure.

You can:
- Filter by capture lane
- Search specific actors
- See network connections
- Share individual events
- Track patterns in real-time

Every event has a unique URL. Share what matters to your community.

I built this because I was drowning in news but starving for understanding.

Because every day brought new outrages but no framework for comprehension.

Because my children deserve better than inheriting a kleptocracy.

## Algorithm Optimization Notes

### What TO DO:
1. **Post link in reply** - Never in main tweet, always as separate reply
2. **Use native photos/videos** when possible - upload timeline screenshots
3. **Post at optimal times**: 9am, 12pm, 5pm, 8pm ET
4. **Use 3-5 hashtags max**, naturally integrated
5. **Encourage replies** with questions
6. **Thread all at once** - Don't spread over hours
7. **Reply to early engagers** quickly
8. **Use numbers and data points**
9. **Break at natural points** for readability
10. **Save important content for tweets 2-5** (highest visibility)

### What NOT TO DO:
1. **Avoid "spammy" words**: Free, Click, Link, Share, Visit
2. **Don't use**: Conspiracy, coup, treason, sedition, resistance
3. **Minimize hashtags** in main tweets
4. **No link shorteners**
5. **Don't ask for RTs directly** ("Please retweet")
6. **Avoid all caps** except for emphasis
7. **Don't use more than 2 emojis per tweet**
8. **No automated posting** - Manual is better
9. **Don't mention algorithm** or "suppression"
10. **Avoid partisan language** - Focus on data

### Hashtag Strategy:
- #OpenSourceIntelligence
- #DataJournalism
- #CivicTech
- #Transparency
- #PublicData

### Reply Strategy for Engagement:

**To skeptics:**
"Every event has multiple sources - court docs, financial records, verified reporting. Click any event to see sources. No speculation, just documentation."

**To supporters:**
"Help us validate events! The community verification system needs people to fact-check sources. What patterns do you see that we might have missed?"

**To questions:**
"Great question! You can filter the timeline by [specific feature]. Here's a direct link to [relevant filtered view]: [link in reply]"

### Follow-up Tweets (Post 2-4 hours later):

**Visual Tweet**
[Screenshot of network visualization]
"The network view reveals connections invisible in daily news.

Same actors. Different scandals. Decades of coordination.

Pattern recognition is the first step to prediction."

**Data Tweet**
[Screenshot of acceleration graph]
"Graphed the timeline data. 

This isn't linear decline. It's cascade.

Each crisis enables 3.5x more capture events."

**Call to Action Tweet**
"Found an event that needs validation? Have sources for something we missed?

The timeline is community-driven. Every contribution strengthens the historical record.
