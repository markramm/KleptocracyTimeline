## üéØ Key Messages by Platform (Cascade-Focused)

### Substack (Full Framework)
- Complete Capture Cascade explanation
- Interactive timeline as evidence base
- Framework for understanding daily news
- Call to identify cascade patterns

### X/Twitter (Viral Pattern)
- "Each capture enables 3 more"
- Exponential growth visualization
- 1‚Üí67‚Üí200+ events/year progression
- "Once you see it, you can't unsee it"

### LinkedIn (Systems Analysis)
- Complex systems failure analysis
- Cascade dynamics in organizations
- Pattern recognition methodology
- Risk assessment applications

### Facebook (Historical Parallel)
- "How democracies historically fail"
- Educational pattern recognition
- Similar cascades in history
- Community pattern spotting

### Bluesky (Academic Framework)

- Scholarly precedents
- Institutional capture theory
- Research methodology

## üìä Metrics to Track

### Week 1 Goals
- 1,000 unique timeline visitors
- 100 GitHub stars
- 50 Substack subscribers
- 10 contributed validations
- 5 new event submissions

### Key Metrics
- Timeline page views
- Average session duration
- GitHub stars/forks
- Substack subscribers/opens
- Social media shares
- Event validations completed
- New events submitted

## üö´ Algorithm Avoidance

### Universal Banned Words
- Conspiracy, coup, treason
- Sedition, insurrection
- Fascist, dictator
- Steal/stolen election
- Criminal, corrupt (use "questionable")

### Platform-Specific Tricks

**X/Twitter**
- Link in reply, not main tweet
- Use native images
- 3-5 hashtags max
- No "RT" requests

**Facebook**
- Link in comments
- "Research project" framing
- Historical/educational angle
- Native photo uploads

**LinkedIn**
- Professional language only
- Technical focus
- Data visualization angle
- Business applications

## üí¨ Engagement Templates (Cascade Framework)

### The Cascade Pitch
"Democracy doesn't fall gradually. It cascades. Each captured institution enables 3 more captures. 790 documented events prove the pattern. Once you see the cascade, you can't unsee it."

### The Exponential Hook
"1970s: 1 capture/year
2020: 67/year
2025: 200+/year
This isn't corruption. It's cascade. And we can show you exactly how each capture enables the next: [link]"

### The Framework Hook
"5-step cascade pattern appears in EVERY democratic collapse:
1. Capture oversight ‚Üí 2. Capture courts ‚Üí 3. Capture enforcement ‚Üí 4. Capture media ‚Üí 5. Cascade accelerates
See it happening in real-time: [link]"

### The Pattern Recognition Call
"We've identified the cascade pattern. Now help us track it. What acceleration patterns do you see in your field? [link]"
