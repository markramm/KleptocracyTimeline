### The Elevator Pitch
"790 documented events. 3,000+ sources. 54 years of patterns. All verifiable. Interactive timeline shows how democracy gets captured - and how we might defend it."

### The Data Hook  
"We went from 1 capture event/year (1970s) to 200+/year (2025). That's not decline - it's cascade. See the pattern: [link]"

### The Network Hook
"Same 47 people across 100+ events over 20 years. Once you see the network, you can't unsee it: [link]"

### The Validation Call
"Every event needs verification. Help us build the most accurate historical record possible: [link]"
