  "content": "A National Guard Oshkosh M-ATV vehicle stands outside of Union Station after Donald Trump deployed the National Guard and ordered an increased presence of federal law enforcement to assist in crime prevention, in Washington, D.C., August 17, 2025.Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 18Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: Zoom Zoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsEx-DOJ antitrust official tears into agency leadership over MAGA-friendly lobbyingWhat Happened: Roger Alford, a recently purged senior DOJ antitrust official, accused Trump leadership of letting MAGA-aligned lobbyists shape antitrust decisions. He pointed to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2013Juniper merger, where Pam Bondi\u2019s chief of staff overruled career officials to push through a settlement benefiting corporate allies.Why It Matters: The episode shows how Trump\u2019s Justice Department is bending law enforcement to serve political patrons and lobbyists. Instead of upholding antitrust law, DOJ power is being wielded as a payoff system for MAGA insiders and corporate cronies.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMississippi and Louisiana Will Send National Guard Troops to D.C.What Happened: Mississippi and Louisiana announced they will deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, joining Ohio, West Virginia, and South Carolina in backing Trump\u2019s federal takeover of the city. About 1,000 troops from these Republican-led states will add to the 800 already mobilized from the D.C. National Guard.Why It Matters: Trump manufactured a crime \u201cemergency\u201d to justify militarizing D.C. despite record-low violence. It\u2019s about consolidating power and normalizing military rule in civilian life, not public safety. The move sets a dangerous precedent for expanding federal control beyond the capital.Source: New York Times and ABC NewsMissouri attorney general appointed co-deputy director of FBIWhat Happened: The DOJ appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director of the FBI alongside Dan Bongino, marking the first time the bureau has had two deputies. Bailey, a staunch Trump loyalist, praised the president and vowed to \u201cMake America Safe Again,\u201d while officials framed it as part of Trump\u2019s mandate.Why It Matters: Installing Bailey and Bongino at the FBI locks in Trump\u2019s takeover of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency. He has already turned the bureau into a partisan weapon, shredding its independence, and this move further entrenches his drive to use it for political investigations against his \u201cenemies.\u201dSource: ABC NewsSoftBank Invests $2B in Intel as Trump Eyes U.S. Government StakeWhat Happened: SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, buying roughly 2% of the company, as Trump considers converting federal Chips Act funds into a 10% U.S. government equity stake. Why It Matters: This move echoes state-capitalist models seen in Russia and China, where governments take direct stakes in industries. Trump\u2019s intervention blurs the line between public policy and corporate control, concentrating power in the presidency while turning America\u2019s tech sector into a political asset.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump says lawyers are drafting executive order to end mail-in votingWhat Happened: Trump announced that lawyers are preparing an executive order to eliminate mail-in ballots, echoing Vladimir Putin\u2019s claim that U.S. elections are \u201crigged\u201d because of mail-in voting. He falsely invoked Jimmy Carter\u2019s legacy to justify the move, while railing against voting machines and insisting states must follow federal directives.Why It Matters: Trump cannot unilaterally end mail-in voting since states control their own election systems. But the absurdity lies in citing Putin\u2014an autocrat who has never overseen a free election and assassinates his opponents\u2014to justify rolling back Americans\u2019 voting rights. It\u2019s a move that imports Kremlin propaganda into U.S. law and primes the ground for mass voter suppression.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsWhite House sending social media teams with FBI on some arrests in D.C., sources sayWhat Happened: The White House has been sending social media teams to film FBI arrests in Washington, D.C., producing promotional videos for Trump\u2019s federal police takeover. One video of a DOJ employee\u2019s arrest was posted on Trump\u2019s official channels, drawing millions of views.Why It Matters: Embedding political media crews into law enforcement operations further shatters DOJ\u2019s independence and risks violating suspects\u2019 constitutional rights. It transforms criminal investigations into propaganda theater, eroding the FBI\u2019s credibility and normalizing authoritarian-style policing.Source: Reuters\u2018We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general\u2019What Happened: Bodycam footage described in a new court filing shows federal agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May \u201cper the deputy attorney general,\u201d despite his peaceful presence at an immigration detention center. The trespassing charge was quickly dropped, and a federal judge blasted the prosecution as an \u201cembarrassing retraction.\u201dWhy It Matters: The revelation confirms that Trump\u2019s DOJ is directing arrests of Democratic officials, weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents. Using federal agents to cuff an opposition mayor is a hallmark of authoritarian rule.Source: PoliticoTexas Democrat says she's locked inside state Capitol after refusing mandatory DPS escortWhat Happened: Texas Rep. Nicole Collier said she was locked inside the state Capitol after refusing a mandatory DPS escort imposed on House Democrats who fled the state to block a GOP-led redistricting plan. Republicans are pushing maps that would add five more GOP-leaning House seats ahead of 2026.Why It Matters: Forcing elected lawmakers to move under police escort is a coercive tactic that undermines democratic representation. Texas Republicans are using state power to strong-arm opposition while pushing through gerrymandered maps designed to entrench their hold on Congress.Source: CBS NewsTrump administration revoked more than 6,000 student visas, State Dept saysWhat Happened: The State Department announced it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, citing \u201clawbreaking, terrorism suspicions, and political activism.\u201d Officials admitted hundreds of visas were canceled over students\u2019 support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel, part of Trump\u2019s broader immigration and free speech crackdown.Why It Matters: Trump continues to weaponize immigration law to silence dissent and punish students for their political views. By tying visas to loyalty tests on foreign policy, Trump is trampling free speech and turning U.S. universities into battlegrounds for control.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsThe Trump ally fighting for criminal investigations of Obama, Biden and ClintonWhat Happened: Mike Davis, a staunch Trump ally, is celebrating Pam Bondi\u2019s approval of multiple criminal probes into Democrats, including Obama, Clinton, Biden, and New York AG Letitia James. Davis claims the investigations will expose a decade-long \u201cconspiracy against Trump,\u201d even though past GOP-led inquiries uncovered no crimes.Why It Matters: MAGA propagandists are laying the groundwork to normalize political persecutions built on discredited conspiracy theories. Trump\u2019s DOJ is weaponizing the law to punish rivals\u2014an authoritarian tactic that criminalizes opposition to cement power.Source: NBC NewsOklahoma will require teachers from NY, CA to prove they back 'America First'What Happened: Oklahoma will now require teachers from New York and California to pass a new \u201cAmerica First\u201d certification test to prove loyalty to conservative values before teaching in the state. The test, developed with PragerU, enforces Trump\u2019s 2020 election conspiracy theories, rejects LGBTQ-inclusive lessons, and rewrites curricula around culture-war themes like mail-in voter fraud and the COVID-19 lab leak.Why It Matters: By forcing educators to swear allegiance to partisan ideology, Oklahoma is weaponizing schools to spread Trump\u2019s election lies and erase civil rights history. It turns education into a political litmus test, cementing extremist narratives for the next generation as part of a broader Republican attack on public education.Source: USA Today\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsNYC student, 7, and family detained by ICE: \u2018Should be getting ready for school\u2019What Happened: ICE detained a 7-year-old Queens public school student and her family, sending the child and her mother to a Texas detention center while her brother remains in custody in New Jersey. The case, the first known arrest of a New York City child under 18 by ICE, has drawn condemnation from local officials and Attorney General Letitia James.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine continues locking up schoolchildren. It\u2019s a brutal expansion of family separation, spreading fear through immigrant communities and shattering trust in schools and public institutions.Source: The HillImmigrant families fear Trump's deportations as children return to schoolWhat Happened: As schools reopen, immigrant families are pulling children from classrooms amid fears of ICE raids tied to Trump\u2019s expanded deportation drive. Districts in Los Angeles and Chicago issued new guidance shielding students, but many mixed-status families have already unenrolled or gone into hiding after threats and detention orders.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is pushing U.S. citizen children out of schools, weaponizing fear to drive self-deportation. By ending protections for schools as \u201csensitive locations,\u201d he is turning classrooms into enforcement zones, eroding education rights and destabilizing immigrant communities.Source: ABC NewsFor D.C.\u2019s Homeless, Strained Lives Become More UnstableWhat Happened: Federal forces have begun clearing homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., tossing tents and belongings and forcing people into shelters, temporary hotels, or the streets. Advocates say no federal resources have been provided to help those displaced, leaving nonprofits scrambling to fill the gap.Why It Matters: The crackdown criminalizes poverty while offering no real solutions. By using police sweeps instead of housing support, Trump is destabilizing lives further and turning America\u2019s capital into a stage for authoritarian showmanship at the expense of the most vulnerable.Source: New York TimesUnder Trump, the Education Dept. has flipped its civil rights missionWhat Happened: The Education Department has gutted its civil rights office, purging half the staff and closing most regional offices while letting a 25,000-case backlog pile up. At the same time, it is prioritizing probes that claim programs for students of color or transgender students are discriminatory, flipping the traditional interpretation of civil rights law on its head.Why It Matters: The agency meant to protect vulnerable students is now targeting them instead, leaving real discrimination cases to languish. By hollowing out enforcement while weaponizing select cases, Trump is dismantling decades of civil rights protections.Source: Washington Post\u2018Lone Star Lockup\u2019: Trump admin opens largest immigration detention center in USWhat Happened: Trump opened \u201cLone Star Lockup,\u201d a new immigration detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, under a $1.2 billion Pentagon contract. The site holds 1,000 beds now, with plans to expand to 5,000 by 2027, drawing GOP praise as a processing hub but sharp criticism from Democrats, local leaders, and the ACLU.Why It Matters: This is the largest federal detention expansion in U.S. history. Critics warn it enriches private contractors, exposes migrants to dangerous conditions, and normalizes a sprawling prison-like network for immigrant detention.Source: The HillHousing Agency to Offer Material Only in English, Official SaysWhat Happened: The Department of Housing and Urban Development will no longer provide documents or communications in languages other than English, canceling all translation contracts and removing existing materials. The move enforces Trump\u2019s executive order making English the official language of the U.S.Why It Matters: This strips millions of Americans of equal access to housing aid and services they are legally entitled to. It weaponizes language as a barrier, deepening discrimination and shutting vulnerable communities out of federal support.Source: New York TimesWhat I Witnessed as I Photographed the Disappearances and the Homecomings of My CountrymenWhat Happened: Over four months, a photojournalist followed five Venezuelan families whose sons were disappeared by the U.S. to El Salvador\u2019s gulag. She documented their anguish, protests, and long-awaited reunions after the men were suddenly flown home.Why It Matters: The families\u2019 stories reveal the human cost of mass disappearances and indefinite detention\u2014parents aging, children without fathers, and sons returning home changed by prison. It\u2019s a stark look at how cruel political decisions reverberate in ordinary lives.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFirings and forced resignations at FBI worry veterans of the agencyWhat Happened: Dozens of FBI officials have been purged or forced out since Trump returned to office, often without explanation or due process. Among those purged was Brian Driscoll, a decorated agent who briefly led the bureau, being pushed out just two years short of his pension. Veterans warn the dismissals amount to a politically driven purge.Why It Matters: These purges send the message that loyalty to Trump outweighs fidelity to the Constitution. It destabilizes careers, guts morale, and compromises the FBI\u2019s independence and ability to protect the public\u2014hallmarks of an authoritarian takeover of law enforcement.Source: NPRTrump\u2019s Rollback of Rules for Mental Health Coverage Could Lead More Americans to Go Without CareWhat Happened: Trump officials paused Biden-era rules that held insurers accountable for denying mental health care, while Congress cut funding for the agency enforcing parity. The moves slash oversight and leave patients more vulnerable to insurance denials.Why It Matters: Trump calls mental health a \u201ccrisis\u201d while gutting protections. Weak enforcement lets insurers deny lifesaving care, pushing families into financial ruin and leaving more Americans untreated.Source: ProPublicaUSDA ends programs for solar, wind projects on farmsWhat Happened: Trump will no longer fund solar and wind projects on productive farmland, ending USDA programs that invested billions in rural clean energy. Secretary Brooke Rollins claimed renewables threaten \u201cprime soil,\u201d despite USDA data showing they use less than 0.05% of U.S. farmland.Why It Matters: This guts rural clean energy. Farmers lose cheaper power, climate progress stalls, and Trump hands a win to fossil fuel donors while killing economic opportunities.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUS aid group \u2018distressed\u2019 at block on medical visas for Gaza childrenWhat Happened: The State Department suspended visas for injured Gaza children after far-right extremist Laura Loomer lobbied Marco Rubio, claiming a secret \u201cIslamic immigration\u201d plot. Aid group Heal Palestine said the children only come temporarily for treatment before returning home.Why It Matters: Blocking medical visas punishes wounded kids to score political points, turning humanitarian relief into a culture-war weapon. It signals how extremist narratives can hijack U.S. policy, eroding America\u2019s moral standing and preventing lifesaving aid.Source: The GuardianModi Hails \u2018Friend\u2019 Putin and Boosts China Ties in Tilt From USWhat Happened: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised Putin as a \u201cfriend\u201d after a post-Alaska summit call and moved to reset ties with China, scheduling talks with Beijing\u2019s foreign minister and weighing a visit. The outreach follows Trump\u2019s 50% tariffs on India over Russian oil imports, which have strained U.S.\u2013India relations.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchWith Rush to Washington and Use of Flattery, E.U. Leaders Help Keep Talks On TrackWhat Happened: After Trump\u2019s warm welcome for war criminal Putin in Alaska raised fears of a U.S.-Russia deal, Zelenskyy and top European leaders rushed to Washington to pressure Trump. Their presence shifted talks toward security guarantees for Ukraine and away from Russian \u201cland-swap\u201d demands, with Ukraine pledging major U.S. arms purchases as part of the discussions.Why It Matters: Europe\u2019s leaders, presenting a united European front, had to flatter Trump just to try and keep him from cutting a backroom deal with Putin. The spectacle underscores how U.S. policy is being shaped around Trump\u2019s ego, creating dangerous openings for Moscow and other adversaries while forcing allies to play along to prevent disaster.Source: New York TimesAn Account Using the Same Name as Trump\u2019s BLS Pick Posted Red-Pilled Conspiracy TheoriesWhat Happened: A now-deleted Twitter account using the full name of E.J. Antoni, Trump\u2019s nominee to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics, spread election denial, Covid conspiracies, misogynistic posts, and violent rhetoric ahead of January 6. The account, which also referenced Nazi military tactics, shared content from pro-Trump extremists and promoted \u201cStop the Steal\u201d narratives. Why It Matters: Trump is elevating an ideologue with a record of spreading extremist propaganda to a key statistical agency. By politicizing the BLS, he will turn neutral economic reporting into a weapon for disinformation and tighten control over another public institution.Source: WIREDTrump caught on hot mic moment talking about making a deal with PutinWhat Happened: Ahead of a multilateral meeting, Trump was caught on a hot mic saying that Vladimir Putin wants to \u201cmake a deal\u201d with him to \u201cresolve the war.\u201d  Trump views himself as \u201ccentral\u201d to talks with Russia, while sidelining allies and formal diplomatic channels.Why It Matters: If Putin truly wanted to \u201dmake a deal,\u201d he could order his military out of Ukraine and end the invasion instantly\u2014no \u201cdeal\u201d required. Trump\u2019s framing hands Moscow leverage and legitimizes Russia\u2019s genocidal aggression.Source: CNNWhat's behind the Trump administration's immigration memes?What Happened: Trump officials are using official government accounts to flood social media with immigration memes, AI-generated propaganda, and white supremacist tropes. Posts glorify deportations, reference racist \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d imagery, and promote Christian nationalist themes, while trolling critics and attacking the press.Why It Matters: Trump is injecting fringe white supremacist and Christian nationalist rhetoric into the mainstream by pushing it through official government channels. At the same time, he\u2019s elevating extremist allies into powerful posts, hardwiring this ideology into federal agencies and turning propaganda into state policy.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsRestaurant attendance takes a dive in DC after Trump\u2019s police actionsWhat Happened: Restaurant attendance in Washington, D.C., plummeted after Trump seized federal control of the city\u2019s police and deployed the National Guard. OpenTable data shows seated diners dropped 16% Monday, 31% Wednesday, and remained down 20% by Saturday compared to last year.Why It Matters: The sharp decline highlights how Trump\u2019s federal takeover is chilling daily life in D.C., hurting businesses and fueling anger over federal overreach. The backlash has reignited calls for D.C. statehood, underscoring how Trump\u2019s law-and-order push is colliding with local autonomy and democratic representation.Source: The HillHome Depot and Lowe's earnings face housing slowdown, tariffs testWhat Happened: Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s report earnings this week as they confront a stalled housing recovery, weak consumer spending, and Trump\u2019s tariffs driving up import costs. Both chains saw summer sales decline.Why It Matters: With tariffs raising costs and consumers pulling back, the pressure is spreading from Wall Street to Main Street, threatening jobs and households.Source: ReutersUS homebuilder sentiment dips back to lowest level since late 2022What Happened: U.S. homebuilder confidence dropped in August to its weakest point since late 2022, with the NAHB/Wells Fargo index slipping to 32. High mortgage rates and affordability pressures are forcing 37% of builders to cut prices and two-thirds to offer incentives to attract buyers.Why It Matters: The slump highlights a fragile housing market where high rates and costs are stifling demand and new construction. With housing starts and permits still depressed, the downturn threatens broader economic growth.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Democratic-led states sue Trump administration over tying grant money to immigrationWhat Happened: Twenty Democratic-led states and D.C. filed suit to block Trump from conditioning more than $1 billion in Victims of Crime Act grants on cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

He pointed to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise\\u2013Juniper merger, where Pam Bondi\\u2019s chief of staff overruled career officials to push through a settlement benefiting corporate allies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The episode shows how Trump\\u2019s Justice Department is bending law enforcement to serve political patrons and lobbyists. Instead of upholding antitrust law, DOJ power is being wielded as a payoff system for MAGA insiders and corporate cronies.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5458361-doj-lobbyist-influence-claims/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Mississippi and Louisiana Will Send National Guard Troops to D.C.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Mississippi and Louisiana announced they will deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington, joining Ohio, West Virginia, and South Carolina in backing Trump\\u2019s federal takeover of the city. About 1,000 troops from these Republican-led states will add to the 800 already mobilized from the D.C. National Guard.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump manufactured a crime \\u201Cemergency\\u201D to justify militarizing D.C. despite record-low violence. It\\u2019s about consolidating power and normalizing military rule in civilian life, not public safety. The move sets a dangerous precedent for expanding federal control beyond the capital.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/us/politics/national-guard-dc-trump-mississippi-louisiana.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a> and</strong></em> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hundreds-national-guard-troops-expected-arrive-dc/story?id=124746215\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Missouri attorney general appointed co-deputy director of FBI</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The DOJ appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director of the FBI alongside Dan Bongino, marking the first time the bureau has had two deputies. Bailey, a staunch Trump loyalist, praised the president and vowed to \\u201CMake America Safe Again,\\u201D while officials framed it as part of Trump\\u2019s mandate.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Installing Bailey and Bongino at the FBI locks in Trump\\u2019s takeover of the nation\\u2019s top law enforcement agency. He has already turned the bureau into a partisan weapon, shredding its independence, and this move further entrenches his drive to use it for political investigations against his \\u201Cenemies.\\u201D</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/missouri-attorney-general-appointed-deputy-director-fbi/story?id=124764098\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>SoftBank Invests $2B in Intel as Trump Eyes U.S. Government Stake</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, buying roughly 2% of the company, as Trump considers converting federal Chips Act funds into a 10% U.S. government equity stake. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move echoes state-capitalist models seen in Russia and China, where governments take direct stakes in industries. Trump\\u2019s intervention blurs the line between public policy and corporate control, concentrating power in the presidency while turning America\\u2019s tech sector into a political asset.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-us-government-stake-22a7f987?mod=hp_lead_pos1\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump says lawyers are drafting executive order to end mail-in voting</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced that lawyers are preparing an executive order to eliminate mail-in ballots, echoing Vladimir Putin\\u2019s claim that U.S. elections are \\u201Crigged\\u201D because of mail-in voting. He falsely invoked Jimmy Carter\\u2019s legacy to justify the move, while railing against voting machines and insisting states must follow federal directives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump cannot unilaterally end mail-in voting since states control their own election systems. But the absurdity lies in citing Putin\\u2014an autocrat who has never overseen a free election and assassinates his opponents\\u2014to justify rolling back Americans\\u2019 voting rights. It\\u2019s a move that imports Kremlin propaganda into U.S. law and primes the ground for mass voter suppression.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-mail-in-ballots-voting-machines-2016-midterms\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>White House sending social media teams with FBI on some arrests in D.C., sources say</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The White House has been sending social media teams to film FBI arrests in Washington, D.C., producing promotional videos for Trump\\u2019s federal police takeover. One video of a DOJ employee\\u2019s arrest was posted on Trump\\u2019s official channels, drawing millions of views.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Embedding political media crews into law enforcement operations further shatters DOJ\\u2019s independence and risks violating suspects\\u2019 constitutional rights. It transforms criminal investigations into propaganda theater, eroding the FBI\\u2019s credibility and normalizing authoritarian-style policing.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/white-house-sending-social-media-teams-with-fbi-some-arrests-dc-sources-say-2025-08-18/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>\\u2018We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Bodycam footage described in a new court filing shows federal agents arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May \\u201Cper the deputy attorney general,\\u201D despite his peaceful presence at an immigration detention center. The trespassing charge was quickly dropped, and a federal judge blasted the prosecution as an \\u201Cembarrassing retraction.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The revelation confirms that Trump\\u2019s DOJ is directing arrests of Democratic officials, weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents. Using federal agents to cuff an opposition mayor is a hallmark of authoritarian rule.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/newark-mayor-arrest-bodycam-footage-todd-blanche-00513734\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Texas Democrat says she's locked inside state Capitol after refusing mandatory DPS escort</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Texas Rep. Nicole Collier said she was locked inside the state Capitol after refusing a mandatory DPS escort imposed on House Democrats who fled the state to block a GOP-led redistricting plan. Republicans are pushing maps that would add five more GOP-leaning House seats ahead of 2026.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Forcing elected lawmakers to move under police escort is a coercive tactic that undermines democratic representation. Texas Republicans are using state power to strong-arm opposition while pushing through gerrymandered maps designed to entrench their hold on Congress.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/texas/news/texas-democrat-nicole-collier-locked-inside-house-chamber-returning-texas-capitol/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump administration revoked more than 6,000 student visas, State Dept says</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The State Department announced it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, citing \\u201Clawbreaking, terrorism suspicions, and political activism.\\u201D Officials admitted hundreds of visas were canceled over students\\u2019 support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel, part of Trump\\u2019s broader immigration and free speech crackdown.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues to weaponize immigration law to silence dissent and punish students for their political views. By tying visas to loyalty tests on foreign policy, Trump is trampling free speech and turning U.S. universities into battlegrounds for control.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-revoked-more-than-6000-student-visas-state-dept-says-2025-08-18/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>The Trump ally fighting for criminal investigations of Obama, Biden and Clinton</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Mike Davis, a staunch Trump ally, is celebrating Pam Bondi\\u2019s approval of multiple criminal probes into Democrats, including Obama, Clinton, Biden, and New York AG Letitia James. Davis claims the investigations will expose a decade-long \\u201Cconspiracy against Trump,\\u201D even though past GOP-led inquiries uncovered no crimes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> MAGA propagandists are laying the groundwork to normalize political persecutions built on discredited conspiracy theories.

The test, developed with PragerU, enforces Trump\\u2019s 2020 election conspiracy theories, rejects LGBTQ-inclusive lessons, and rewrites curricula around culture-war themes like mail-in voter fraud and the COVID-19 lab leak.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By forcing educators to swear allegiance to partisan ideology, Oklahoma is weaponizing schools to spread Trump\\u2019s election lies and erase civil rights history. It turns education into a political litmus test, cementing extremist narratives for the next generation as part of a broader Republican attack on public education.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/08/17/oklahoma-requires-blue-state-teachers-america-first-curriculum/85510568007/#\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>NYC student, 7, and family detained by ICE: \\u2018Should be getting ready for school\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE detained a 7-year-old Queens public school student and her family, sending the child and her mother to a Texas detention center while her brother remains in custody in New Jersey. The case, the first known arrest of a New York City child under 18 by ICE, has drawn condemnation from local officials and Attorney General Letitia James.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s deportation machine continues locking up schoolchildren. It\\u2019s a brutal expansion of family separation, spreading fear through immigrant communities and shattering trust in schools and public institutions.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5456692-nyc-student-ice-detention/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Immigrant families fear Trump's deportations as children return to school</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As schools reopen, immigrant families are pulling children from classrooms amid fears of ICE raids tied to Trump\\u2019s expanded deportation drive. Districts in Los Angeles and Chicago issued new guidance shielding students, but many mixed-status families have already unenrolled or gone into hiding after threats and detention orders.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s crackdown is pushing U.S. citizen children out of schools, weaponizing fear to drive self-deportation. By ending protections for schools as \\u201Csensitive locations,\\u201D he is turning classrooms into enforcement zones, eroding education rights and destabilizing immigrant communities.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/immigrant-families-fear-trumps-deportations-children-return-school/story?id=124753982\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>For D.C.\\u2019s Homeless, Strained Lives Become More Unstable</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Federal forces have begun clearing homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., tossing tents and belongings and forcing people into shelters, temporary hotels, or the streets. Advocates say no federal resources have been provided to help those displaced, leaving nonprofits scrambling to fill the gap.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The crackdown criminalizes poverty while offering no real solutions. By using police sweeps instead of housing support, Trump is destabilizing lives further and turning America\\u2019s capital into a stage for authoritarian showmanship at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/us/politics/washington-dc-homeless.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Under Trump, the Education Dept. has flipped its civil rights mission</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Education Department has gutted its civil rights office, purging half the staff and closing most regional offices while letting a 25,000-case backlog pile up. At the same time, it is prioritizing probes that claim programs for students of color or transgender students are discriminatory, flipping the traditional interpretation of civil rights law on its head.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The agency meant to protect vulnerable students is now targeting them instead, leaving real discrimination cases to languish. By hollowing out enforcement while weaponizing select cases, Trump is dismantling decades of civil rights protections.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/18/trump-education-department-civil-rights/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>\\u2018Lone Star Lockup\\u2019: Trump admin opens largest immigration detention center in US</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump opened \\u201CLone Star Lockup,\\u201D a new immigration detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, under a $1.2 billion Pentagon contract. The site holds 1,000 beds now, with plans to expand to 5,000 by 2027, drawing GOP praise as a processing hub but sharp criticism from Democrats, local leaders, and the ACLU.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is the largest federal detention expansion in U.S. history. Critics warn it enriches private contractors, exposes migrants to dangerous conditions, and normalizes a sprawling prison-like network for immigrant detention.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5457476-lone-star-lockup-criticized/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Housing Agency to Offer Material Only in English, Official Says</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Housing and Urban Development will no longer provide documents or communications in languages other than English, canceling all translation contracts and removing existing materials. The move enforces Trump\\u2019s executive order making English the official language of the U.S.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This strips millions of Americans of equal access to housing aid and services they are legally entitled to. It weaponizes language as a barrier, deepening discrimination and shutting vulnerable communities out of federal support.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/us/politics/housing-agency-english-material-trump.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>What I Witnessed as I Photographed the Disappearances and the Homecomings of My Countrymen</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Over four months, a photojournalist followed five Venezuelan families whose sons were disappeared by the U.S. to El Salvador\\u2019s gulag. She documented their anguish, protests, and long-awaited reunions after the men were suddenly flown home.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The families\\u2019 stories reveal the human cost of mass disappearances and indefinite detention\\u2014parents aging, children without fathers, and sons returning home changed by prison. It\\u2019s a stark look at how cruel political decisions reverberate in ordinary lives.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/cecot-released-family-reunions-photos\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCC9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Firings and forced resignations at FBI worry veterans of the agency</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Dozens of FBI officials have been purged or forced out since Trump returned to office, often without explanation or due process. Among those purged was Brian Driscoll, a decorated agent who briefly led the bureau, being pushed out just two years short of his pension. Veterans warn the dismissals amount to a politically driven purge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These purges send the message that loyalty to Trump outweighs fidelity to the Constitution. It destabilizes careers, guts morale, and compromises the FBI\\u2019s independence and ability to protect the public\\u2014hallmarks of an authoritarian takeover of law enforcement.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/18/nx-s1-5500423/firings-and-forced-resignations-at-fbi-worry-veterans-of-the-agency\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s Rollback of Rules for Mental Health Coverage Could Lead More Americans to Go Without Care</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump officials paused Biden-era rules that held insurers accountable for denying mental health care, while Congress cut funding for the agency enforcing parity. The moves slash oversight and leave patients more vulnerable to insurance denials.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump calls mental health a \\u201Ccrisis\\u201D while gutting protections. Weak enforcement lets insurers deny lifesaving care, pushing families into financial ruin and leaving more Americans untreated.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/mental-health-insurance-trump-rules\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>USDA ends programs for solar, wind projects on farms</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump will no longer fund solar and wind projects on productive farmland, ending USDA programs that invested billions in rural clean energy. Secretary Brooke Rollins claimed renewables threaten \\u201Cprime soil,\\u201D despite USDA data showing they use less than 0.05% of U.S. farmland.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This guts rural clean energy. Farmers lose cheaper power, climate progress stalls, and Trump hands a win to fossil fuel donors while killing economic opportunities.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/usda-ends-programs-solar-wind-projects-farms-2025-08-18/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>US aid group \\u2018distressed\\u2019 at block on medical visas for Gaza children</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The State Department suspended visas for injured Gaza children after far-right extremist Laura Loomer lobbied Marco Rubio, claiming a secret \\u201CIslamic immigration\\u201D plot. Aid group Heal Palestine said the children only come temporarily for treatment before returning home.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Blocking medical visas punishes wounded kids to score political points, turning humanitarian relief into a culture-war weapon.

The outreach follows Trump\\u2019s 50% tariffs on India over Russian oil imports, which have strained U.S.\\u2013India relations.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-18/china-india-seek-better-ties-as-us-policies-add-to-uncertainty\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF0D Far-Right &amp; Russian Influence Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>With Rush to Washington and Use of Flattery, E.U.

Their presence shifted talks toward security guarantees for Ukraine and away from Russian \\u201Cland-swap\\u201D demands, with Ukraine pledging major U.S. arms purchases as part of the discussions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Europe\\u2019s leaders, presenting a united European front, had to flatter Trump just to try and keep him from cutting a backroom deal with Putin.

The account, which also referenced Nazi military tactics, shared content from pro-Trump extremists and promoted \\u201CStop the Steal\\u201D narratives. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is elevating an ideologue with a record of spreading extremist propaganda to a key statistical agency.
