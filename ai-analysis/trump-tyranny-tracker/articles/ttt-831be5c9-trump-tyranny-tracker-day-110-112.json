Roberto Schmidt | Afp | Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 9-11Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Again, I apologize for the delays in posting the tracker\u2014I needed to take a short break. I'm now fully caught up, and today\u2019s TTT will be out tonight. Thank you all so much for your continued support.\ud83d\udea8 AnnouncementTrump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev will resume Tuesday at 2 PM ET. We just launched this to shine a spotlight on the stories that demand our immediate attention\u2014power grabs, agency purges, surveillance overreach, and the tactics being used to dismantle democracy in real time. Please tune in and spread the word!\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsLarge Investors Pour Hundreds of Millions Into Trump MediaWhat Happened: SEC filings show that major institutional investors, including Charles Schwab Investment Management and Australia\u2019s Hancock Prospecting, significantly increased their holdings in Trump Media and Technology Group despite the company\u2019s massive losses in 2024.Why It Matters: These investments reek of political payoffs, not legitimate business decisions. Trump still holds shares in TMTG, which is now pushing a crypto venture advised by Schwab and expanding inside federal agencies. The surge in stock buys lines up with Trump policies that directly benefit these insiders\u2014raising red flags about market manipulation and brazen corruption.Source: The GuardianIn Mideast, Trump Prioritizes Business Over Geopolitics, Blurs Line with Family DealsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s first major foreign trip centers on business deals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE\u2014deliberately skipping Israel and sidestepping urgent regional crises like Gaza and Iran\u2019s nuclear threat. The visit closely follows new Trump Organization activity in the Gulf, reiterating that diplomacy is being used to chase private profits.Why It Matters: Trump is using foreign policy as a pay-to-play scheme, putting personal profit ahead of American interests, allies, strategy, and human rights. His Gulf deals\u2014some tied to his and his family\u2019s business\u2014send a clear message: corruption comes first, and authoritarian regimes are welcome partners.Source: Washington PostTrump in talks with Qatar over plane giftWhat Happened: Trump is negotiating with Qatar for a $400 million aircraft\u2014modeled after his gaudy gold Trump Tower aesthetic\u2014to use as Air Force One, with plans to later transfer it to his presidential library. The gift would violate the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars foreign gifts without congressional approval.Why It Matters: Accepting a $400 million gift from a foreign country is blatant corruption. It sets a dangerous precedent, especially with Trump\u2019s business ties to Qatar, and erases any line between public office and personal enrichment \u2014 just like in Russia.Source: Washington PostJared Kushner Quietly Advising Trump Administration Ahead of Middle East TripWhat Happened: Jared Kushner is informally advising Trump officials ahead of Trump\u2019s Middle East visit, guiding talks with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. While not part of the official delegation, Kushner is helping shape efforts to secure economic agreements, leveraging his personal ties to Arab leaders.Why It Matters: Kushner\u2019s role is pure self-dealing\u2014shaping Middle East policy while cashing in on Gulf money. He has billions pouring in from Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, and this is more corruption in plain sight.Source: CNNTrump, Raking In Cash, Expands His Power in the G.O.P. Money WorldWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s super PAC, MAGA Inc., has raised $400 million since the 2024 election, while Trump allies have taken over key Republican congressional super PACs. Formerly independent groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund and Senate Leadership Fund are now closely aligned with the White House, filled with loyalists and Trump campaign veterans.Why It Matters: Trump has turned the GOP into a loyalty cult, sidelining moderates and taking over key fundraising and strategy. The 2026 midterms won\u2019t be about policy\u2014it will be a Musk-funded purge of anyone who defies him.Source: New York TimesSEC Settles with Trump-Linked Crypto Firm, Commissioner Calls It a \u201cTremendous Disservice\u201dWhat Happened: The SEC reached a controversial settlement with Ripple Labs, a crypto firm tied to Trump, allowing it to recover $75 million of a previously imposed $125 million fine. The deal would also lift a prior injunction against the company.Why It Matters: SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw called the deal a \u201ctremendous disservice,\u201d warning it guts crypto enforcement and puts investors at risk. Ripple, a Trump donor with insider access, is reaping the rewards. Source: ABC NewsElon Musk\u2019s Regulatory Woes Are Conveniently Vanishing Under TrumpWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return, over 40 regulatory cases involving Musk\u2019s companies\u2014SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink\u2014have stalled or been quietly dropped. Investigations into labor abuses, discrimination, and animal cruelty were shut down or gutted after Musk took power and helped dismantle federal oversight across key agencies.Why It Matters: Musk, once facing over $2.3 billion in fines, now operates with legal impunity while raking in billions in federal contracts. A Senate report says he\u2019s dismantling the government for personal gain, as Trump protects his empire and pushes Musk\u2019s projects.Source: Rolling StoneTrump to Sign Order Discouraging Criminal Enforcement of Regulatory OffensesWhat Happened: Trump plans to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to scale back the use of criminal charges for regulatory violations. The order mandates agencies to publish lists of offenses that could trigger prosecution and provide guidance to limit referrals unless clear criminal intent is involved.Why It Matters: This is part of a long-running conservative effort to gut federal oversight by labeling it \u201covercriminalization.\u201d This will let corporations off the hook, especially in food, drug, and environmental safety, by making it harder to hold them accountable for breaking the law.Source: ReutersMeet the Top Donors to Trump\u2019s $239 Million Inauguration FundWhat Happened: Trump raised a record-shattering $239 million for his 2025 inauguration, bankrolled by crypto firms, tech giants, and companies under investigation. Donors included Ripple Labs, JPMorgan Chase, Uber, and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman. Over $16 million came from Trump appointees or their spouses\u2014many of whom were rewarded with government positions.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration haul doubled that of 2017, exposing the growing merger of political power and corporate money. Some major donors hold key government posts, highlighting pay-to-play schemes, regulatory favors, and a system where tech, crypto, and energy giants can buy influence\u2014and immunity.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump \"Actively Looking\" at Suspending Habeas Corpus to Deport Migrants, Stephen Miller SaysWhat Happened: White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said that Trump is considering suspending habeas corpus to expedite mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, citing the Constitution\u2019s exception for \u201crebellion or invasion.\u201dWhy It Matters: Suspending habeas corpus would shred a fundamental legal safeguard \u2014 the right to challenge unlawful detention \u2014 and has only been used in extreme national emergencies (not invented ones). Trump is using students and immigrants as a test case to see how far he can push constitutional limits.Source: CBS NewsTrump Calls for 20,000 Extra Officers to Help With Deportation EffortsWhat Happened: Trump issued an order to expand his deportation force by 20,000 officers, calling for the deputization of state and local law enforcement and other personnel to ramp up mass deportations. Why It Matters: This would mark a massive escalation of immigration enforcement, blending federal and local powers to carry out deportations and disappearances. The scale, funding, and legality of such a program remain unclear, but it signals Trump\u2019s intention to build a police state answering to his directives.Source: New York TimesDespite His Radicalism, Ed Martin Lands Powerful Justice Department RoleWhat Happened: After his Senate confirmation failed, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d loyalist Ed Martin was quickly reassigned by Trump to three powerful DOJ roles: director of the new \u201cWeaponization Working Group,\u201d associate deputy attorney general, and pardon attorney. Why It Matters: Trump is stacking the DOJ with loyalists who will carry out his orders\u2014even illegal ones\u2014while purging anyone who resists. Martin\u2019s appointment reiterates that the DOJ is a weapon for MAGA revenge, where law enforcement and pardon power are used to reward allies and crush opposition.Source: MSNBCWhite House Fires Copyright Chief After AI Report, Escalating Library of Congress PurgeWhat Happened: The Trump White House fired U.S. Copyright Office head Shira Perlmutter just days after ousting Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. Perlmutter became a target after releasing a report warning that AI training on copyrighted material could be illegal, clashing with Trump and Musk\u2019s drive to rapidly expand AI and centralize federal data.Why It Matters: The firing shows Trump is politicizing copyright law to clear the way for unchecked AI expansion. Dissenting experts are being purged to remove legal obstacles\u2014proof that loyalty, speed, and control matter more than the law.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsICE Shifts Detainees to Pro-Deportation Texas CourtWhat Happened: Trump is relocating Venezuelan migrants to a Texas district where a Trump-appointed judge has allowed disappearances under the Alien Enemies Act\u2014sidestepping courts that blocked removals. Some transfers violated court orders, with detainees moved just before legal relief could be filed.Why It Matters: ICE is exploiting jurisdictional tactics to fast-track disappearances without due process, using a wartime law despite no war. Advocates warn this sets a dangerous precedent for mass removals and legal abuse.Source: Washington PostNewark Mayor Arrested at ICE Facility During Protest Over Detention ConditionsWhat Happened: Newark Mayor and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Ras Baraka was arrested for \u201ctrespassing\u201d at an ICE detention facility after federal agents claimed he refused to leave. Baraka had joined members of Congress for an oversight visit and was later released, calling the arrest \u201ctargeted.\u201d ICE and DHS allege he remained unlawfully, which Baraka disputes, saying he was initially granted entry.Why It Matters: The arrest inflames tensions over a reopened ICE facility that local leaders say is operating in violation of state laws. Baraka, a sharp critic of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, says his arrest is part of a wider effort to silence dissent and strip power from local governments challenging federal overreach.Source: NBC NewsAfter Jailing of Newark Mayor, DHS Warns \u201cMore Arrests Coming\u201dWhat Happened: After arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an ICE facility during an oversight visit, DHS now claims that accompanying lawmakers, Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez could also face arrest, alleging bodycam footage shows them assaulting ICE officers.Why It Matters: Arresting and threatening sitting members of Congress is a stunning escalation in Trump\u2019s war on oversight and dissent. With DHS now floating the suspension of habeas corpus, the regime is openly embracing authoritarian tactics to silence opposition and consolidate power.Source: Mother JonesTrump Targets Fired USAID Workers for Speaking to PressWhat Happened: At least 6 USAID employees who gave interviews after Musk\u2019s purges are now under internal investigation for \u201cunauthorized media engagement.\u201d They had believed they were already terminated.Why It Matters: This is a clear attempt to silence dissent and intimidate whistleblowers. Legal experts argue it\u2019s retaliation that undermines free speech protections for federal workers.Source: CBS NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFake pizza orders sent to judges seen as threat to judicial safetyWhat Happened: Federal judges in at least 7 states have received anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes, seen as an intimidation tactic amid legal battles against Trump\u2019s policies. The deliveries, often tied to recent rulings against Trump, include one sent in the name of a judge\u2019s murdered son. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate campaign to harass and intimidate judges, echoing Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on the judiciary. Trump and his MAGA base continue putting targets on anyone who stands in his way, clearing the path to seize full power by eliminating all checks and opposition.Source: Washington PostNew FEMA Head Tells Staff: \"Don't Get in My Way\u2026 I Will Run Right Over You\"What Happened: Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson, a former Marine appointed by Trump after his predecessor was fired for defending the agency\u2019s existence, told staff in his first meeting that he would \"run right over\" anyone who resists Trump\u2019s agenda to downsize or dismantle FEMA.Why It Matters: Richardson\u2019s remarks make clear that Trump plans to gut FEMA right as hurricane season begins. His appointment is part of a broader agenda to install loyalists, purge dissenters, and dismantle agencies.Source: CBS News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Seeks to Strip Away Legal Tool Key to Civil Rights EnforcementWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to eliminate the use of \u201cdisparate-impact liability,\u201d a cornerstone of civil rights law used since the 1960s to challenge policies that disproportionately harm protected groups. This includes education, employment, housing, and law enforcement policies that appear neutral but have discriminatory outcomes.Why It Matters: This sweeping rollback guts one of the strongest tools for enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, revealing the regime\u2019s intent to end the fight against systemic discrimination. It\u2019s a direct assault on civil rights\u2014and a major win for far-right extremists.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s DOJ Stripped Lifeline Legal Services From the Most Vulnerable Detained ImmigrantsWhat Happened: Trump canceled the National Qualified Representative Program, which provided government-paid lawyers for detained immigrants with serious mental health or cognitive disabilities. Advocates warn this effectively leaves the most vulnerable to face deportation proceedings alone, often without understanding the charges or the system.Why It Matters: Without legal counsel, many of these detainees\u2014some of whom can't even state their name or age\u2014face indefinite detention or deportation to countries they barely know. This marks a major rollback of basic due process rights, with devastating consequences for hundreds of people.Source: Mother JonesPentagon orders military to pull all library books on diversityWhat Happened: The Pentagon has ordered all military libraries to pull books on diversity, anti-racism, gender identity, and related topics by May 21, per a memo from Pete Hegseth\u2019s office.Why It Matters: This unprecedented purge targets hundreds of titles, including books on civil rights and the Holocaust. It\u2019s an effort to erase vital history, suppress dissent, and rewrite the past as part of Trump\u2019s broader extremist agenda.Source: Military TimesTribal Communities Risk Losing Local Libraries and the History They Hold Amid DOGE CutsWhat Happened: Trump abruptly terminated federal grants that support more than 100 libraries on tribal lands, jeopardizing essential services like internet access, early literacy programs, and cultural preservation. The cuts came after Trump\u2019s March executive order directing the elimination of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the agency responsible for the funding.Why It Matters: These cuts threaten to erase vital community institutions in rural tribal areas, where local libraries serve as lifelines to education, technology, and cultural continuity. Tribes and library unions have sued, warning that dismantling IMLS without congressional approval violates the law and undermines tribal sovereignty.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFEMA Cuts Emergency Training Under Trump as Hurricane Season NearsWhat Happened: Trump slashed FEMA\u2019s in-person hurricane preparedness training, imposed travel and speech restrictions on staff, and fired a third of the agency\u2019s workforce. Key sessions, including those at the National Hurricane Conference, were canceled or moved online.Why It Matters: As a busy hurricane season approaches, Trump\u2019s effort to gut FEMA and fire the head is weakening disaster readiness. Local officials may lack critical training and updated tools, risking lives if major storms hit.Source: ReutersState Department Plans Deeper-than-Anticipated Staff CutsWhat Happened: The State Department plans to cut 3,400 positions starting June 2, significantly higher than the previously estimated 2,000. Most foreign service officers won\u2019t be eligible to transfer.Why It Matters: These cuts will gut key policy areas, wipe out offices like special envoys and cybersecurity units, and force hundreds of diplomats out by July 1. It\u2019s a deliberate move to shrink U.S. influence abroad while giving Trump tighter control over who stays\u2014through Schedule F-style loyalty hires.Source: Defense OneDOGE Is Bringing Back a Deadly DiseaseWhat Happened: Trump and Musk have gutted federal workplace safety programs, including the team monitoring silicosis, a deadly but preventable lung disease. Key agencies like NIOSH and MSHA have been hollowed out, with enforcement of updated safety rules paused and major regional offices shut down.Why It Matters: Silicosis cases are already surging among miners and countertop workers, especially immigrants. Without federal oversight, thousands more workers are likely to suffer or die from this illness. Source: The AtlanticFDA Stalls in Posting Food Safety Warning Letters Amid Staff CutsWhat Happened: The FDA has not published over a dozen food safety warning letters due to staffing shortages. The purges gutted the team responsible for reviewing and redacting sensitive information before public release, stalling the agency\u2019s ability to flag violations like potential botulism risks and contaminated supplements.Why It Matters: Warning letters are a crucial FDA tool to expose unsafe food practices and pressure companies to act. By hiding them, Trump officials are shielding violators, weakening enforcement, and keeping the public in the dark.Source: NBC NewsNational Science Foundation eliminates equity division, cancels dozens more grantsWhat Happened: The National Science Foundation eliminated its Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM and canceled 73 more research grants. Around 70 staff were purged, with 300 more temporary roles to be cut. Why It Matters: These moves are part of Trump\u2019s purge of \u201cDEI\u201d initiatives and broader cuts to federal science programs. Over 1,400 grants\u2014totaling $1 billion\u2014have been canceled. Leading universities are suing over the sudden changes, warning of long-term damage to U.S. innovation.Source: USA TodayFAA Weighs Cutting Newark Flights After Hundreds of DisruptionsWhat Happened: The FAA is weighing flight reductions at Newark Liberty International Airport after major equipment failures and a severe shortage of air traffic controllers caused over 1,000 flight disruptions. A 90-second outage left planes invisible to controllers, triggering follow-up incidents and forcing several staff onto trauma leave.Why It Matters: The system is cracking\u2014runway work, aging infrastructure, and summer demand are overwhelming air traffic control. United has already cut 35 daily flights at Newark, warning that FAA schedules are unsafe. Without $31 billion in upgrades from Congress, flight cuts and chaos could spread nationwide.Source: CNBCHHS Moves Again to Fire Probationary Employees What Happened: The Department of Health and Human Services is resuming efforts to terminate thousands of probationary employees, many of whom had previously been put on paid leave following a court-ordered pause in February.Why It Matters: The Trump and RFK Jr. purges are gutting already understaffed health agencies like the CDC and NIH. Firing top performers signals these are political purges, and they\u2019re destroying the institutions meant to protect public health.Source: CBS NewsFederal Workplace Safety Workers Warn of Deadly Consequences from Trump CutsWhat Happened: Over 100 current and former employees of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health sent a letter to Congress warning that mass purges are putting American workers at risk. More than 90% of NIOSH staff have received layoff notices, and critical programs like the 9/11 Health Program and black lung screenings have already been disrupted.Why It Matters: NIOSH\u2019s near-total dismantling isn\u2019t just bureaucratic\u2014it\u2019s a direct assault on worker safety. Programs that protect miners, 9/11 survivors, and factory workers are on the brink of collapse. Without action from Congress, preventable deaths and injuries will rise.Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIran's Top Diplomat Arrives for Indirect Nuclear Talks With US in OmanWhat Happened: Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Muscat ahead of the fourth round of indirect nuclear talks with the U.S. The talks come just before Trump\u2019s Middle East visit. Iran reiterated that uranium enrichment is non-negotiable, blaming the U.S. for shifting positions.Why It Matters: These negotiations could decide whether the U.S. and Iran avoid confrontation. But with Tehran digging in on enrichment and Trump\u2019s reckless, unpredictable diplomacy, the risk of escalation is high.Source: ABC NewsIndia and Pakistan Accuse Each Other of Breaking Ceasefire After Trump-Brokered DealWhat Happened: Just hours after Trump and Marco Rubio announced a \u201cfull and immediate\u201d U.S.-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, both countries accused each other of violating the agreement. Explosions were reported in Kashmir, despite commitments by both nations to halt hostilities.Source: NBC NewsU.S. Spy Agencies Told to Gather Intelligence on GreenlandWhat Happened: Trump ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to ramp up spying on Greenland, including its independence movement and political sentiment toward U.S. interests. Tulsi Gabbard condemned the leak of the directive and threatened prosecutions of whistleblowers. Denmark, which governs the island, expressed outrage, with Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen saying, \u201cWe do not spy on friends.\u201dWhy It Matters: This has strained relations with Denmark, a key NATO ally, and threatens the transatlantic alliance as Trump floats using military force to illegally annex Greenland. He\u2019s fueling distrust, acting more like Putin than a U.S. president\u2014treating allies as obstacles and land as a commodity.Source: NBC NewsPentagon Considers Shifting Greenland to US Northern Command, Sparking Concerns Over Trump\u2019s Ambitions for the TerritoryWhat Happened: Trump is considering shifting military oversight of Greenland from U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, claiming it\u2019s more relevant to North American defense. The move would effectively reclassify Greenland under the command responsible for defending the U.S. homeland.Why It Matters: The proposed shift is fueling fears that Trump is laying the groundwork to seize Greenland. Danish officials are worried, especially as U.S. intelligence activity ramps up on the island.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchZelenskyy challenges Putin to meet him after Trump demands Ukraine-Russia talksWhat Happened: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly invited Putin to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for direct talks to end the war, following Trump\u2019s demand that Ukraine accept Russia\u2019s offer for negotiations. Zelensky added that a ceasefire should begin on Monday as a precondition.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push for talks plays right into Putin\u2019s hands, undercutting Western unity and pressuring Ukraine to negotiate on Russia\u2019s terms. As the West threatens new sanctions, Trump is offering Putin a way out\u2014one that legitimizes a genocidal invasion and rewards aggression.Source: BBC NewsKremlin Spokesman: Putin Considers Trump \u2018A Wise Man, A Brave Man\u2019What Happened: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov praised Trump in an ABC News interview, calling him \u201ca wise man, a brave man,\u201d and portrayed Putin as \u201cready for peace\u201d\u2014on the condition that the West halts weapons shipments to Ukraine.Why It Matters: The Kremlin is praising Trump because it sees him as key to helping Russia in its genocidal war. Putin sees Trump as his tool to shatter Western unity. And Russia can end the war by stopping its genocide and getting out of Ukraine.Source: ABC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Announces 25 Percent Tariffs on Imported CarsWhat Happened: Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on all imported cars and auto parts, escalating his trade war and targeting foreign automakers. The White House says more tariffs are coming. Why It Matters: These tariffs risk inflaming global trade tensions, raising prices for American consumers, and disrupting the auto industry supply chain. Source: Washington PostU.S. Could Face Default by August if Congress Doesn't Address Debt Ceiling, Bessent SaysWhat Happened: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned lawmakers that the federal government could run out of cash and borrowing power by August if Congress doesn't raise or suspend the debt ceiling by mid-July.Why It Matters: A failure to act would trigger a catastrophic default, undermining the U.S. financial system, weakening global standing, and damaging business confidence. With Congress set to recess in July, Bessent urged urgent action to avoid an economic crisis.Source: CBS NewsHow Tariffs Are Crushing Small Businesses: \u2018Nobody in Power Seems to Care\u2019What Happened: Small business owners across the U.S. are being devastated by Trump\u2019s tariffs. Companies with limited supply chains and financial buffers are laying off staff, running out of inventory, and dipping into personal savings to stay afloat.Why It Matters: Unlike large corporations, small businesses lack the resources to absorb the tariffs or pivot to new suppliers. Many face closures, mass layoffs, and liquidation.

The visit closely follows new Trump Organization activity in the Gulf, reiterating that diplomacy is being used to chase private profits.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Trump is using foreign policy as a pay-to-play scheme, putting personal profit ahead of American interests, allies, strategy, and human rights. His Gulf deals\u2014some tied to his and his family\u2019s business\u2014send a clear message: corruption comes first, and authoritarian regimes are welcome partners.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/11/trump-mideast-trip/\" rel=\"\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Trump in talks with Qatar over plane gift<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trump-in-talks-with-qatar-over-plane-gift\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/163354015/trump-in-talks-with-qatar-over-plane-gift\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump is negotiating with Qatar for a $400 million aircraft\u2014modeled after his gaudy gold Trump Tower aesthetic\u2014to use as Air Force One, with plans to later transfer it to his presidential library.

The visit closely follows new Trump Organization activity in the Gulf, reiterating that diplomacy is being used to chase private profits.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using foreign policy as a pay-to-play scheme, putting personal profit ahead of American interests, allies, strategy, and human rights.

The gift would violate the Constitution\\u2019s emoluments clause, which bars foreign gifts without congressional approval.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Accepting a $400 million gift from a foreign country is blatant corruption.

Formerly independent groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund and Senate Leadership Fund are now closely aligned with the White House, filled with loyalists and Trump campaign veterans.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has turned the GOP into a loyalty cult, sidelining moderates and taking over key fundraising and strategy.

The deal would also lift a prior injunction against the company.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw called the deal a \\u201Ctremendous disservice,\\u201D warning it guts crypto enforcement and puts investors at risk.

Investigations into labor abuses, discrimination, and animal cruelty were shut down or gutted after Musk took power and helped dismantle federal oversight across key agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk, once facing over $2.3 billion in fines, now operates with legal impunity while raking in billions in federal contracts.

Donors included Ripple Labs, JPMorgan Chase, Uber, and OpenAI\\u2019s Sam Altman. Over $16 million came from Trump appointees or their spouses\\u2014many of whom were rewarded with government positions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s 2025 inauguration haul doubled that of 2017, exposing the growing merger of political power and corporate money.
