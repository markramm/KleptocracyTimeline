Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 29Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 10Google Meet: August 5, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump in Scotland Mixes Presidential Diplomacy With Family BusinessWhat Happened: During a four-day visit to Scotland, Trump opened a new golf course while negotiating trade deals with EU and UK leaders. The taxpayer-funded trip used White House resources to promote Trump resorts, showing no separation between his presidency and private business.Why It Matters: Trump continues openly merging presidential power with personal enrichment. Foreign leaders now cater to his private business interests to stay in his favor\u2014obliterating the line between governance and his businesses.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsInside Preparations for Trump\u2019s Next Supreme Court NomineeWhat Happened: Trump and top conservative lawyers are laying the groundwork for a possible Supreme Court vacancy, floating names like Andrew Oldham and Neomi Rao. Allies want a nominee more loyal to Trump than Amy Coney Barrett, who has sometimes ruled with liberals.Why It Matters: A new Trump pick would lock in an ultra-conservative Court for generations, consolidating presidential power and eroding judicial independence. The selection process is being shaped by personal loyalty over constitutional checks on executive authority.Source: TIMETrump Bypasses Congress to Keep Interim Prosecutors in California and NevadaWhat Happened: Trump extended interim U.S. attorneys in Los Angeles and Las Vegas by redesignating them as \u201cacting\u201d prosecutors, bypassing Senate confirmation and judicial appointments. A similar move in New Jersey has already caused court chaos, with proceedings canceled over questions of authority.Why It Matters: This tactic lets Trump sidestep constitutional checks to install loyalists as top federal prosecutors, weakening Senate oversight, creating legal uncertainty, and consolidating Justice Department control in key states.Source: New York TimesTrump seeks to keep US Attorneys in place before court can actWhat Happened: Trump extended Interim U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah\u2019s term in Nevada and kept Bill Essayli as California\u2019s top federal prosecutor, bypassing court authority to appoint replacements. Over 100 retired judges urged Nevada\u2019s court to reject Chattah, citing racist remarks and extreme bias.Why It Matters: Trump is exploiting loopholes to entrench partisan loyalists as federal prosecutors, weakening judicial checks, politicizing law enforcement, and jeopardizing criminal cases tied to their contested appointments.Source: ReutersSenate confirms controversial Trump nominee Emil Bove as federal judgeWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed Emil Bove, a top Trump DOJ official and former personal lawyer for Trump, to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Bove faced 3 whistleblower complaints alleging he pushed Trump\u2019s political agenda over the law, lied to lawmakers, and told subordinates to ignore court orders during mass deportation efforts.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s confirmation gives Trump loyalists more control over the federal judiciary, underscoring Trump\u2019s broader plan to eliminate judicial independence. Despite whistleblower evidence and bipartisan opposition, the rushed confirmation highlights the regime\u2019s drive to stack courts with political operatives.Source: Washington PostTop Generals Nominated for New Positions Must Now Meet With TrumpWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth instituted a new policy requiring all four-star general nominees to meet personally with Trump before their nominations proceed. While presidents have occasionally met candidates for key military posts, this blanket requirement is unprecedented and has already slowed promotions.Why It Matters: This injects political loyalty tests into senior military appointments, erasing the tradition of a nonpartisan military. It further consolidates Trump\u2019s control over top brass, eroding safeguards meant to keep the armed forces insulated from partisan influence.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJustice Dept. Seeks Censure of Judge, Widening Fight With JudiciaryWhat Happened: The Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against Judge James Boasberg for \u201cremarks\u201d about Trump, seeking his removal from a migrant deportation case, a public reprimand, and possible impeachment referral.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing the DOJ to intimidate judges who block his agenda, threatening judicial independence and pushing to purge courts of those who resist executive overreach.Source: New York TimesTop Lawyer for National Security Agency Is FiredWhat Happened: April Falcon Doss, the National Security Agency\u2019s top lawyer and former Senate Intelligence Committee staffer, was purged after far-right extremist Laura Loomer amplified attacks on her. The firing follows earlier Trump purges of NSA leadership, including the director and deputy director, over claims of \u201cdisloyalty.\u201dWhy It Matters: This purge ousts another experienced, apolitical national security expert as cyber threats escalate. By letting conspiracy theorists dictate staffing, Trump is gutting U.S. intelligence, endangering national security, and weakening defenses against foreign adversaries.Source: New York TimesTrump Prosecutor in L.A. Seeks to Drop Two High-Profile Criminal CasesWhat Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli moved to dismiss charges against Fatburger founder Andrew Wiederhorn and overturn the conviction of Deputy Trevor Kirk, found guilty of federal civil rights violations for assaulting and pepper-spraying a woman.Why It Matters: The Trump DOJ is unraveling major cases to protect politically connected figures and law enforcement allies. This shatters prosecutorial norms, underscores White House interference, and signals a justice system warped by political loyalty.Source: New York TimesTodd Blanche's past hangs over him as top DOJ official on Epstein caseWhat Happened: Former Trump attorney and now Deputy AG Todd Blanche personally interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell in an apparent DOJ effort to shield Trump. The move bypassed standard FBI protocols and is further clouded by Blanche\u2019s past role defending Trump and his close ties to Maxwell\u2019s lawyer.Why It Matters: Blanche\u2019s direct involvement underscores that the DOJ is actively covering up Epstein-related evidence to protect Trump. His glaring conflict of interest and the secrecy around the Maxwell interview deepen concerns that the investigation is being manipulated for political ends.Source: NPRInterim U.S attorney in D.C. mandates immigration checks on all defendantsWhat Happened: Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro has ordered immigration checks on all criminal defendants in Washington, D.C., embedding ICE agents in her office to advance Trump\u2019s mass deportation drive. Even minor offenders risk being funneled into deportation proceedings without legal representation.Why It Matters: This merges local prosecution with federal immigration enforcement, eroding due process and further terrorizing immigrant communities. By turning D.C.\u2019s justice system into a deportation pipeline, Trump is weaponizing the courts and undermining public safety.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsCBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepanciesWhat Happened: A CBS News investigation found that surveillance footage used by federal officials, including former AG Bill Barr, to assert Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s 2019 jail suicide does not clearly show the cell block entrance. Experts flagged inconsistencies in the video, missing footage, possible edits, and unmonitored access points that contradict FBI and DOJ reports.Why It Matters: These findings undermine the integrity of the federal probe into Epstein\u2019s death, casting doubt on claims that no one entered his cell. With raw footage still withheld and key security failures unexplained, public skepticism over what really happened is only set to deepen.Source: CBS NewsTrump wants Harvard to pay far more than Columbia as part of settlementWhat Happened: Trump is negotiating a settlement with Harvard that could force the school to pay hundreds of millions\u2014far surpassing Columbia\u2019s $200 million deal. The regime has already slashed billions in Harvard\u2019s federal research funding, using financial pressure to force compliance.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal agencies and imposing massive fines to enforce ideological conformity in universities. This threatens academic independence and lays the groundwork for future political crackdowns on education.Source: Associated PressHarvard to comply with Trump demand to turn over employment formsWhat Happened: Harvard will comply with a DHS subpoena demanding employment verification forms for thousands of staff as the Trump regime pressures elite schools with federal funding freezes. The university is withholding some student job records over privacy concerns while negotiating a $500 million settlement to restore frozen grants.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing immigration enforcement and federal funding to force ideological submission from universities. This tightens government control over academia, coercing institutions to adopt Trump-aligned policies under threat of financial destruction. As the saying goes, never comply with dictators.Source: Reuters\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsHe Was Asked About His Tattoos and a TikTok Video in Court. Five Days Later, He Was in a Salvadoran Prison.What Happened: ICE disappeared Albert Jes\u00fas Rodr\u00edguez Parra and 230 other Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison, citing tattoos and a TikTok as gang evidence. Rodr\u00edguez was tortured before a U.S.\u2013Venezuela prisoner exchange freed him.Why It Matters: ICE is disappearing immigrants to foreign gulags without due process, committing flagrant human rights violations. These actions echo tactics of dictatorships, eroding constitutional protections.Source: ProPublica\u2018Cemetery of the living dead\u2019: Venezuelans recall 125 days in notorious El Salvador prisonWhat Happened: Over 250 Venezuelans disappeared by ICE were secretly flown to El Salvador\u2019s gulag, where they endured 125 days of beatings, humiliation, and psychological abuse. Many had no criminal records and were targeted simply for being Venezuelan with tattoos. Freed in a U.S.\u2013Venezuela prisoner swap, survivors say they were treated as bargaining chips.Why It Matters: This mass abduction outsourced U.S. immigration enforcement to one of the world\u2019s harshest gulags, using terror tactics and human lives as leverage. It exposes authoritarian coordination between Trump and Bukele that trampled due process and human rights.Source: The GuardianImmigrants in the US illegally fight Trump\u2019s new no-bail policyWhat Happened: A class-action lawsuit challenges Trump\u2019s new policy denying bail to undocumented immigrants, forcing even long-term U.S. residents with no criminal history to remain detained while fighting deportation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s policy expands indefinite detention, tears families apart, and bypasses judicial norms, pushing many to abandon legal claims just to escape harsh conditions.Source: NPRDHS Urges DACA Recipients to Self-DeportWhat Happened: Trump officials are pressuring over 500,000 DACA recipients to leave the U.S., with DHS stating they are not protected from deportation and should \u201cself-deport\u201d to return legally later. Immigration arrests of Dreamers and cuts to health and education benefits have heightened fears, despite no formal rule ending DACA.Why It Matters: This crackdown erodes DACA without formally ending it, leaving Dreamers exposed to arrest and deportation. It weaponizes fear to drive immigrants into hiding and signals Trump\u2019s intent to gut protections through backdoor enforcement tactics.Source: NPRCivil rights agency sued over handling of trans worker discrimination complaintsWhat Happened: Legal groups sued the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging it\u2019s unlawfully refusing to enforce workplace protections for transgender employees. The agency has dropped multiple lawsuits, stalled new cases, and halted payments to state civil rights agencies. Plaintiffs say this violates Supreme Court precedent and federal anti-discrimination laws.Why It Matters: This marks a sweeping rollback of LGBTQ+ workplace protections. By defying established legal standards, Trump is dismantling decades of civil rights progress, leaving transgender workers vulnerable to discrimination without federal recourse.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchPete Hegseth has discussed running for political office in Tennessee, sources sayWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth has privately discussed running for governor of Tennessee next year, according to sources familiar with the talks. Such a move would require Hegseth to resign from his role overseeing the U.S. military.Why It Matters: Hegseth\u2019s potential gubernatorial run is insane and unprecedented. This chaos deepens the politicization of the Pentagon, erodes military stability, and signals to adversaries that America\u2019s defense leadership is fractured and vulnerable, inviting them to exploit the instability to advance their own strategic goals.Source: NBC NewsPentagon Thrown Into Confusion Over Think Tank BanWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth has barred Pentagon officials from attending think tank and research events, labeling them \u201cAmerica Last\u201d venues. The directive has thrown the department into turmoil, leaving military leaders unsure of what they can say publicly and severing key lines of dialogue with allies, policy experts, and defense industry innovators.Why It Matters: This unprecedented gag order muzzles the Pentagon and isolates U.S. defense policy from democratic allies. It\u2019s part of a broader strategy to politicize the armed forces, silence dissent, and consolidate message control under Trump loyalists.Source: PoliticoMedicare Part D Drug Plan Premiums Set to RiseWhat Happened: Premiums for Medicare Part D drug plans will rise sharply in 2026 as drug costs climb and Trump slashes federal subsidies by 40%. Why It Matters: Millions of seniors will face higher drug costs, pushing many toward private Medicare Advantage plans. This weakens traditional Medicare while funneling power and profits to private insurers, reshaping senior healthcare coverage\u2014all so the wealthy can enjoy tax cuts.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump slashed federal funding for gun violence preventionWhat Happened: Trump has cut $158 million\u2014over half\u2014of federal grants for community violence intervention programs nationwide. The DOJ claims the programs no longer fit agency priorities, leaving grassroots organizations in major cities and underserved communities scrambling to survive.Why It Matters: These cuts dismantle proven initiatives that reduce shootings and homicides. By defunding prevention while boosting law enforcement, Trump is reversing bipartisan efforts to tackle America\u2019s gun violence crisis at its roots.Source: ReutersWith AI Plan, Trump Chips Away at Foundational Environmental LawWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new AI Action Plan rewrites the National Environmental Policy Act, granting broad exemptions for data centers and infrastructure projects to bypass environmental reviews and public comment.Why It Matters: This guts a cornerstone environmental law, stripping away oversight and public input. It paves the way for unchecked, high-impact industrial expansion that threatens ecosystems and public health.Source: ABC NewsTrump EPA moves to repeal landmark \u2018endangerment finding\u2019 that allows climate regulationWhat Happened: Trump moved to revoke the EPA\u2019s 2009 \u201cendangerment finding,\u201d the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. EPA chief Lee Zeldin called it \u201cthe largest deregulatory action in U.S. history,\u201d aiming to erase climate rules on cars, power plants, and industry despite worsening climate disasters.Why It Matters: Stripping this finding would permanently cripple the government\u2019s ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. It\u2019s a sweeping rollback of science-based protections, prioritizing polluters over public health and climate safety.Source: Associated PressMedical group urges Kennedy not to fire US care task forceWhat Happened: The American Medical Association warned RFK Jr. against plans to purge all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sets recommendations for cancer screenings and other preventive health measures. Kennedy has already replaced the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee with anti-vaccine extremists, raising fears of politicized medical guidance.Why It Matters: Dismantling the task force would gut evidence-based preventive care standards, cutting access to lifesaving screenings and weakening public health policy. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader war on science, which will leave Americans dangerously exposed to preventable disease and health crises.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s 15% tariff on medicines will harm patients, say EU drugmakersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new trade deal slaps a 15% tariff on EU-made medicines, breaking a long-standing WTO zero-tariff pact. Major drugmakers like Bayer, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, and J&J warn the move will disrupt supply chains, cut R&D, and limit access to critical medicines for patients in both the U.S. and EU.Why It Matters: This will drive up drug costs for Americans and stall pharmaceutical innovation. Healthcare systems could face shortages as tariffs choke the free flow of essential medicines.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchChina Sees Gaps in U.S. Defenses, Ousted National Security Official SaysWhat Happened: Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, former NSA and Cyber Command chief, warned that China is exploiting gaps in U.S. cyberdefenses to steal intelligence and plant malware for future attacks. Haugh was ousted after Trump\u2019s extremist conspiracy theorist and adviser, Laura Loomer, falsely accused him of \u201cdisloyalty,\u201d leaving a leadership vacuum in cyber operations.Why It Matters: Political purges are stripping the U.S. of seasoned cyber leaders just as China escalates cyberwarfare. With defenses weakened and experts sidelined, Trump is leaving American infrastructure and communications exposed to escalating espionage and catastrophic cyberattacks.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchOvernight strikes on Ukraine kill 25 as Trump sets Russia new truce deadlineWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s latest missile barrage murdered 25 people in Ukraine, including a pregnant woman and 16 prison inmates in Zaporizhzhia, marking one of the deadliest assaults in months. The attack came as Trump \u201cshortened\u201d his deadline for Putin to reach a ceasefire to 10 days, threatening tariffs if no progress is made.Why It Matters: Despite Russia\u2019s genocidal war and civilian massacres, Trump has avoided strong measures against Moscow, giving Russia cover to continue its atrocities. This has only emboldened Russia to escalate its war unchecked, eroding global security and further weakening U.S. credibility.Source: The GuardianPutin\u2019s Space Chief Visits US for Talks With NASA, Musk\u2019s SpaceXWhat Happened: Dmitry Bakanov, head of Russia\u2019s space agency, made a rare visit to the U.S. for talks with NASA\u2019s Sean Duffy on the International Space Station\u2019s future. Bakanov is touring NASA facilities, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX operations, Boeing\u2019s spacecraft program, and attending a Crew-11 launch carrying a Russian cosmonaut. He also disclosed NASA officials secretly visited Moscow in June.Why It Matters: Even as Russia wages a genocidal war in Ukraine, its space chief is being welcomed inside top U.S. space facilities. This grants Russia access and influence over American space projects despite ongoing war crimes, genocide, and sanctions.Source: Bloomberg News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Gets Tariffs; Americans Get Price HikesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs are forcing consumer goods giants like Procter & Gamble to hike U.S. prices on essentials by mid-single digits, with other brands set to follow. Companies report billions in tariff-driven losses and warn that as inventory buffers deplete, inflation will surge deeper into 2025.Why It Matters: Marketed as a boost to U.S. manufacturing, these tariffs are instead taxing middle-class households through rising everyday costs. Economists warn that this policy will worsen inflation, slash corporate earnings, and threaten American jobs.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis findsWhat Happened: A new analysis finds Trump\u2019s tariffs could raise factory costs by 2\u20134.5%, straining supply chains and threatening jobs in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Businesses already report surging steel prices, investment delays, and looming layoffs.Why It Matters: These tariffs act as a tax on U.S. manufacturing and households, driving up prices, suppressing wages, and eroding competitiveness. Trump\u2019s protectionist agenda risks crippling the very industrial base he claims to \u201cdefend.\u201dSource: Associated PressTrump\u2019s Trade Deals Come With Few Details to Flesh Out Big NumbersWhat Happened: Trump unveiled trade deals with Japan and the EU, boasting $1 trillion in foreign investment as proof that his tariffs are \u201cworking.\u201d But partner officials say much of it is loans or nonbinding pledges, lacking mechanisms to guarantee real investment.Why It Matters: Trump is pushing inflated promises while cementing steep tariffs that will burden U.S. consumers and businesses. The chaotic deals risk global economic turmoil and expose his protectionist agenda as smoke and mirrors.Source: BloombergUS workers say Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages: \u2018A strain on everybody\u2019What Happened: Trump\u2019s immigration purge\u2014revoking legal status for over a million immigrants and closing parole programs\u2014is gutting factory workforces in states like Kentucky and Michigan. GE Appliances and Kraft Heinz plants have seen mass firings, production chaos, and punishing overtime for remaining workers.Why It Matters: Raids and visa cancellations are crippling industries dependent on immigrant labor, risking millions of jobs and billions in GDP. Manufacturing is sliding toward crisis as unions fracture and workplace safety collapses under Trump\u2019s hardline purge.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsTexas Democrats are fundraising to potentially leave the state to block GOP-backed redistrictingWhat Happened: As Texas Republicans push a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan, Democrats are exploring another quorum break like their 2021 walkout.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.Judicial Capture: Trump is systematically stacking courts with loyalists while bypassing Senate checks, eroding judicial independence and consolidating executive power.Weaponized Institutions: DOJ, ICE, and federal agencies are being used to intimidate judges, terrorize immigrants, and enforce political loyalty over law and due process.Military Politicization: Hegseth\u2019s loyalty tests for generals and Pentagon purges weaken national security, leaving U.S. defenses exposed to foreign threats.Civil Rights Rollback: Trump\u2019s regime is dismantling protections for immigrants, transgender workers, and vulnerable communities, normalizing indefinite detention and discrimination.Foreign Authoritarian Ties: Russia and China are exploiting Trump\u2019s leadership vacuum, with Russia gaining access to U.S. technology and space operations while both escalate hybrid warfare.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Allies want a nominee more loyal to Trump than Amy Coney Barrett, who has sometimes ruled with liberals.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> A new Trump pick would lock in an ultra-conservative Court for generations, consolidating presidential power and eroding judicial independence.

A similar move in New Jersey has already caused court chaos, with proceedings canceled over questions of authority.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This tactic lets Trump sidestep constitutional checks to install loyalists as top federal prosecutors, weakening Senate oversight, creating legal uncertainty, and consolidating Justice Department control in key states.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/trump-us-attorneys-california-nevada.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump seeks to keep US Attorneys in place before court can act</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump extended Interim U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah\\u2019s term in Nevada and kept Bill Essayli as California\\u2019s top federal prosecutor, bypassing court authority to appoint replacements. Over 100 retired judges urged Nevada\\u2019s court to reject Chattah, citing racist remarks and extreme bias.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is exploiting loopholes to entrench partisan loyalists as federal prosecutors, weakening judicial checks, politicizing law enforcement, and jeopardizing criminal cases tied to their contested appointments.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-seeks-keep-us-attorneys-place-before-court-can-act-2025-07-29/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Senate confirms controversial Trump nominee Emil Bove as federal judge</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Senate confirmed Emil Bove, a top Trump DOJ official and former personal lawyer for Trump, to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Bove faced 3 whistleblower complaints alleging he pushed Trump\\u2019s political agenda over the law, lied to lawmakers, and told subordinates to ignore court orders during mass deportation efforts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Bove\\u2019s confirmation gives Trump loyalists more control over the federal judiciary, underscoring Trump\\u2019s broader plan to eliminate judicial independence.

While presidents have occasionally met candidates for key military posts, this blanket requirement is unprecedented and has already slowed promotions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This injects political loyalty tests into senior military appointments, erasing the tradition of a nonpartisan military.

The firing follows earlier Trump purges of NSA leadership, including the director and deputy director, over claims of \\u201Cdisloyalty.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This purge ousts another experienced, apolitical national security expert as cyber threats escalate.

The move bypassed standard FBI protocols and is further clouded by Blanche\\u2019s past role defending Trump and his close ties to Maxwell\\u2019s lawyer.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Blanche\\u2019s direct involvement underscores that the DOJ is actively covering up Epstein-related evidence to protect Trump. His glaring conflict of interest and the secrecy around the Maxwell interview deepen concerns that the investigation is being manipulated for political ends.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5484129/todd-blanche-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-trump\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Interim U.S attorney in D.C. mandates immigration checks on all defendants</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro has ordered immigration checks on all criminal defendants in Washington, D.C., embedding ICE agents in her office to advance Trump\\u2019s mass deportation drive. Even minor offenders risk being funneled into deportation proceedings without legal representation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This merges local prosecution with federal immigration enforcement, eroding due process and further terrorizing immigrant communities. By turning D.C.\\u2019s justice system into a deportation pipeline, Trump is weaponizing the courts and undermining public safety.</p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/07/29/pirro-mandates-dc-immigration-checks/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A CBS News investigation found that surveillance footage used by federal officials, including former AG Bill Barr, to assert Jeffrey Epstein\\u2019s 2019 jail suicide does not clearly show the cell block entrance. Experts flagged inconsistencies in the video, missing footage, possible edits, and unmonitored access points that contradict FBI and DOJ reports.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These findings undermine the integrity of the federal probe into Epstein\\u2019s death, casting doubt on claims that no one entered his cell.

The regime has already slashed billions in Harvard\\u2019s federal research funding, using financial pressure to force compliance.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing federal agencies and imposing massive fines to enforce ideological conformity in universities.

The university is withholding some student job records over privacy concerns while negotiating a $500 million settlement to restore frozen grants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues weaponizing immigration enforcement and federal funding to force ideological submission from universities. This tightens government control over academia, coercing institutions to adopt Trump-aligned policies under threat of financial destruction.

Rodr\\u00EDguez was tortured before a U.S.\\u2013Venezuela prisoner exchange freed him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> ICE is disappearing immigrants to foreign gulags without due process, committing flagrant human rights violations.

Many had no criminal records and were targeted simply for being Venezuelan with tattoos. Freed in a U.S.\\u2013Venezuela prisoner swap, survivors say they were treated as bargaining chips.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This mass abduction outsourced U.S. immigration enforcement to one of the world\\u2019s harshest gulags, using terror tactics and human lives as leverage.

Immigration arrests of Dreamers and cuts to health and education benefits have heightened fears, despite no formal rule ending DACA.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This crackdown erodes DACA without formally ending it, leaving Dreamers exposed to arrest and deportation.

The agency has dropped multiple lawsuits, stalled new cases, and halted payments to state civil rights agencies. Plaintiffs say this violates Supreme Court precedent and federal anti-discrimination laws.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks a sweeping rollback of LGBTQ+ workplace protections.
