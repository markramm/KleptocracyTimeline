REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File PhotoShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 5-6Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Please keep Texas in your thoughts\u2014especially for the families mourning loved ones and those still waiting for news of the missing.What a devastating and heartbreaking tragedy\u2026Some links to help those impacted: USA TodayAuthoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 6Google Meet: July 8, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsThe Advertisers Spending Big in West Palm Beach Just to Reach TrumpWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return to office, over a dozen interest groups have spent $2 million airing targeted TV ads in West Palm Beach\u2014many seemingly meant for his eyes only. Ads from automakers, pharma, DHS, and others praise Trump before urging action on tariffs, drug prices, or immigration.Why It Matters: Everyone knows Trump is so corrupt and for sale that lobbyists no longer bother with policy channels\u2014they buy TV ads to speak directly to him.Source: Wall Street JournalAlina Habba Has Been Under an Ethics Investigation for Over a YearWhat Happened: Alina Habba, Trump\u2019s interim U.S. attorney pick for New Jersey, has been under state ethics investigation since 2024 for allegedly coercing a harassment victim at Trump\u2019s golf club into a hush money deal\u2014then using it to gain Trump\u2019s favor. She quietly settled the case, but the probe remains open.Why It Matters: Trump is trying to install an appointee accused of exploiting a victim to climb his inner circle\u2014while she weaponizes her office to target political opponents. Source: NOTUS\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump and GOP target ballots arriving after Election Day that delay counts and feed conspiracy fearsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s March executive order, currently paused by lawsuits, aims to ban counting mail ballots received after Election Day. He lied that such ballots are illegal and uses delayed counts to stoke fraud narratives. GOP-led states like Kansas and North Dakota are now advancing laws to cut grace periods for mail voting.Why It Matters: This is targeted voter suppression. Trump continues undermining trust in elections by weaponizing routine vote counting, laying the groundwork to dispute results and delegitimize future elections in 2026 and 2028.Source: Associated Press\u2018He likes the game too much\u2019: Why Trump isn\u2019t sweating his lack of trade dealsWhat Happened: With his July 9 tariff deadline looming, Trump has secured just a handful of vague trade deals, yet shows little concern. Officials say he\u2019s more focused on wielding tariffs as leverage than finalizing agreements, often threatening countries with new duties even mid-negotiation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade policy is spectacle rather than strategy\u2014fueled by ego and control. As allies scramble and markets remain volatile, the real cost lands on American consumers, exporters, and long-term stability. Source: PoliticoGOP eyes redistricting in Ohio and Texas as it looks to bolster slim majorityWhat Happened: Republicans, holding a slim 220\u2013212 House majority, are eyeing redistricting in Ohio and Texas to protect vulnerable seats. Ohio is legally required to redraw its map by 2026, while Texas may do so in a special session reportedly urged by the Trump White House.Why It Matters: The GOP continues rigging the map to lock in power. Redrawing districts to favor one party undermines fair representation and threatens to entrench minority rule before the 2026 midterms.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsGoodbye to All ThatWhat Happened: Veteran FBI special agent Michael Feinberg published his resignation letter after being forced out due to a personal friendship with Pete Strzok, a former FBI official targeted by Trump allies. He says the decision came at Dan Bongino\u2019s direction and was enforced by leadership loyal to Kash Patel.Why It Matters: Feinberg\u2019s ouster shows how Trump loyalists are gutting the FBI to install political enforcers. This purge erodes national security, replaces expertise with MAGA subservience, and turns federal law enforcement into a tool of partisan control.Source: LawfareIncoming DHS Intelligence Lead Promotes Unlawful ActivitiesWhat Happened: Matthew Kozma, Trump\u2019s pick to lead DHS intelligence, told Congress that officers may use fake identities to access private communications\u2014despite legal bans. He downplayed rules restricting collection to public info, sparking fears of activist surveillance.Why It Matters: Kozma\u2019s position signals a dangerous expansion of domestic spying\u2014as Trump builds a surveillence state. With safeguards gutted, Trump\u2019s DHS is poised to weaponize surveillance to monitor and silence dissent under the cover of national security.Source: Just Security\u2018Blatant misinformation\u2019: Social Security Administration email praising Trump\u2019s tax bill blasted as a \u2018lie\u2019What Happened: The Social Security Administration sent a misleading mass email claiming Trump\u2019s spending bill eliminates income taxes on Social Security. In truth, it offers only a limited, temporary deduction. Legal experts condemned the email as deceptive and partisan.Why It Matters: A once-neutral agency is now echoing Trump\u2019s propaganda, eroding public trust. This marks another step in the authoritarian politicization of federal institutions.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsWhy some fear government data on the U.S. economy is losing integrityWhat Happened: Budget cuts, retirements, and political interference are crippling agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trump officials are pushing to alter key economic benchmarks while slashing funding, making inflation and job reports less reliable.Why It Matters: Discrediting and reshaping official data is a classic authoritarian tactic. Without trusted stats, the public loses its compass\u2014and the truth becomes whatever the regime says it is. This is how it works in Russia, where data serves the Kremlin.Source: The Washington PostTrump is waging war against the media \u2013 and winningWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s war on the press is intensifying\u2014suing networks, threatening CNN with prosecution, banning the AP from the White House, and coercing CBS and ABC into $16M settlements. Media outlets, fearing retaliation, are caving.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian playbook 101: intimidate and control the press. As journalism weakens, Trump is erasing one of democracy\u2019s last lines of defense.Source: The GuardianElon Musk\u2019s \u2018America\u2019 party could focus on a few pivotal congressional seatsWhat Happened: Elon Musk launched the \u201cAmerica Party\u201d to flip key Senate and House seats. Despite spending $277 million to back Trump in 2024, Musk now vows to punish lawmakers who supported the bill and \u201cdisrupt the uniparty.\u201dWhy It Matters: This mirrors a controlled opposition strategy\u2014splintering anti-Trump momentum while reinforcing MAGA dominance. It\u2019s a tactic seen in Russia, where the Kremlin creates fake opposition parties to give the illusion of choice. This is something to watch closely.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE detained a mother who was still breastfeeding. Her Marine veteran husband fights for her freedomWhat Happened: Paola Clouatre, a 25-year-old mom and wife of a Marine veteran, was detained by ICE at her green card hearing in May\u2014despite breastfeeding her baby and having no criminal record. A missed court notice from her teens triggered a deportation order the couple only learned about days before.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation push is sweeping up even breastfeeding moms and military families. Paola\u2019s case shows a system with no compassion\u2014where service to the country and family mean nothing.Source: CNN \u2018I want my vote back\u2019: Trump-voting family stunned after Canadian mother detained over immigration statusWhat Happened: Cynthia Olivera, a Canadian mother of three U.S.-born kids, was detained by ICE at her green card interview in California\u2014despite living, working, and paying taxes in the U.S. for decades. Her Trump-supporting husband now says he regrets his vote after watching his family torn apart.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine spares no one\u2014not even longtime residents or his own supporters. Families are being shattered, and the false promise that \u201cgood immigrants\u201d would be safe is being brutally exposed.Source: The GuardianHow Trump's policies are reshaping immigration enforcement in Puerto RicoWhat Happened: Immigration raids have surged across Puerto Rico, with over 700 people\u2014mostly Dominicans\u2014arrested since January. Without local detention centers, detainees are flown to the mainland, severing them from their families and legal aid. Civil rights groups cite racial profiling and mounting fear in immigrant communities.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s dragnet is transforming Puerto Rico from refuge to battleground, isolating immigrants through deportations and systemic discrimination. Vulnerable communities now face legal limbo and growing hostility in a U.S. territory once seen as safe.Source: NBC NewsICE Raids Derail Los Angeles Economy as Workers Go Into HidingWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s ICE raids in Los Angeles have led to over 1,600 arrests, forcing immigrant workers vital to post-wildfire rebuilding into hiding. Construction sites and businesses are shutting down, protests have erupted, and the National Guard was deployed. Mayor Karen Bass warned the raids are inflicting \u201csevere economic damage.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is destabilizing communities and gutting LA\u2019s ability to recover, showing how immigration policy is being weaponized to break cities.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchAs Floods Hit, Key Roles Were Vacant at Weather Service Offices in TexasWhat Happened: As flash floods hit Central Texas, key Weather Service offices lacked senior staff due to Trump\u2019s workforce purge, hampering coordination with local officials. Despite timely warnings, officials blamed forecasts for underestimating rainfall, though experts said the storm escalated too quickly to predict.Why It Matters: Federal staffing purges are weakening the U.S. response to extreme weather. Without full teams in place, local communities face greater risks during disasters.Source: New York Times\u2018Tears My Heart to Pieces\u2019: North Carolina Braces for Medicaid CutsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new law slashes Medicaid funding to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, threatening North Carolina\u2019s expansion and plans to reopen a rural hospital in Martin County. Over 660,000 low-income residents could lose coverage as work requirements and funding cuts take effect.Why It Matters: The law risks mass uninsured rates and more rural hospital closures. Communities like Martin County could lose their only access to care\u2014putting lives at risk.Source: New York TimesTrump Promised \u2018No Tax on Tips.\u2019 Then Came the Fine Print.What Happened: Trump\u2019s new tax law offers a deduction of up to $25,000 in tips\u2014but it doesn\u2019t eliminate taxes. Payroll taxes remain, undocumented workers are excluded, and low-income earners may see little benefit. The deduction phases out for higher incomes and expires in 2028.Why It Matters: Despite the bold promise, the fine print limits who gains\u2014and by how much. Many service workers expecting full tax relief will be left disappointed.Source: Wall Street JournalMillions more Americans could turn to food banks soon. Food banks are simply not ready.What Happened: Trump and GOP lawmakers passed $1 trillion in cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, gutting food and healthcare support for low-income Americans. Food banks warn they can\u2019t meet demand, with SNAP cuts alone slashing up to 9 billion meals a year. Some changes start this year, including harsher work rules and reduced nutrition funding.Why It Matters: The U.S. is hurtling toward a hunger crisis. Trump\u2019s war on the social safety net will leave families with no food, healthcare, and lifeline\u2014especially in rural and red-state communities that helped elect him.Source: PoliticoOver 100 former senior officials warn against planned staff cuts at US State DepartmentWhat Happened: Over 130 former U.S. diplomats and officials, including Susan Rice, condemned Marco Rubio\u2019s plan to purge thousands at the State Department. The move is temporarily blocked by court order.Why It Matters: Gutting the State Department during global crises cripples U.S. diplomacy and hands leverage to adversaries like China and Russia. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d purge is hollowing out America\u2019s global influence when it\u2019s needed most.Source: ReutersNurse on new CDC vaccine panel said to have been \u2018anti-vax longer than RFK\u2019What Happened: Vicky Pebsworth, a nurse who\u2019s claimed for decades that vaccines caused her son\u2019s autism, has been appointed to the CDC\u2019s vaccine panel by RFK Jr. She replaces one of 17 experts purged last month and has ties to anti-vaccine groups funded by disinformation peddlers.Why It Matters: Trump has handed vaccine policy to RFK Jr., who is purging career experts and filling HHS with anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists. This endangers public health and marks a wider assault on science and evidence-based medicine.Source: The GuardianUS Measles Cases at an All-Time High After Disease 'Eliminated'What Happened: The U.S. has recorded 1,277 measles cases in 2025\u2014its worst outbreak since eradication in 2000\u2014with 155 hospitalizations and 3 deaths. The outbreak centers on an unvaccinated Mennonite community in West Texas and has spread to 39 states.Why It Matters: This is what happens when an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, RFK Jr., is in charge. His attacks on science have shattered public health defenses. Measles is now surging across 39 states, endangering herd immunity and overwhelming hospitals nationwide.Source: Newsweek\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchRussia's Lavrov meets Iran's Araqchi, renews offer to help solve conflictWhat Happened: At the BRICS summit, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov met with Iran\u2019s Abbas Araqchi and condemned U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Lavrov reiterated Moscow\u2019s offer to \u201cmediate\u201d and store Iranian uranium.Source: ReutersXi Has Spent Decades Preparing for a Cold War With the U.S.What Happened: Xi Jinping has spent years preparing China for a long-term Cold War-style standoff with the U.S., avoiding direct conflict while building economic self-reliance, strengthening party control, and undermining American alliances. Inspired by the Soviet collapse, Xi aims to buy time and gradually shift the global balance of power in China\u2019s favor.Why It Matters: While Trump lashes out with chaotic tariffs, Xi is playing the long game\u2014fortifying China\u2019s economy and quietly undermining U.S. influence. His strategy is clear: outlast and outmaneuver a distracted America.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia seeks to involve Laos in war against Ukraine, military intelligence claimsWhat Happened: Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence reports that Russia is deploying up to 50 Laotian military engineers to Kursk Oblast under the pretense of demining. Laos is also offering rehabilitation to wounded Russian soldiers\u2014part of a broader Kremlin strategy to normalize foreign troop involvement.Why It Matters: Ukraine is fighting against a growing axis of authoritarian regimes backing Russia\u2019s genocidal war\u2014North Korean troops and weapons, Iranian and Chinese weapons, and now Laotian support. Source: The Kyiv IndependentThe Warning Signs for Russia\u2019s Economy Are Flashing RedWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s economy, propped up by record military spending and redirected oil exports, is now slowing sharply. Manufacturing is contracting, inflation is high, and budget deficits persist as officials warn of a looming recession.Why It Matters: As Russia\u2019s economy falters, Trump is bailing Putin out\u2014blocking new sanctions and cutting aid to Ukraine just when pressure on the Kremlin should be highest.Source: Wall Street JournalS\u00e4po Reports Increase in Hybrid Threat Incidents in SwedenWhat Happened: Sweden\u2019s Security Service (S\u00e4po) reports a sharp increase in hybrid threat incidents, including sabotage of telecom masts, GPS disruptions, and cable breaks. While officials urge caution in blaming foreign actors, military intelligence warns Russia is growing bolder in exploiting instability and spreading propaganda to sow public distrust.Why It Matters: Sweden faces mounting pressure from suspected Russian hybrid warfare. Even without clear attribution, Russia\u2019s objective is clear: carry out terrorist and sabotage operations to destabilize society, spread fear, and undermine democratic resilience across Europe.Source: Sweden HeraldRevealed: the far-right, antisemitic men\u2019s club network spreading across USWhat Happened: The Old Glory Club, a far-right, antisemitic men\u2019s group, has spread to 26 chapters in 20 states. Members include military, police, lawyers, and civil servants\u2014some with security clearances\u2014who promote fascist, racist, and antisemitic views, hold in-person events, and use apps to target minority-owned businesses.Why It Matters: This is a national security threat hiding in plain sight. As Trump dismantles safeguards against extremism inside government, hate groups like the OGC are embedding themselves deeper into law enforcement, the military, and civil society\u2014preparing for something far more dangerous than online rhetoric.Source: The GuardianMaga influencer and de facto national security adviser Laura Loomer holds outsized sway on TrumpWhat Happened: MAGA extremist Laura Loomer, with no formal government role, has become a powerful force in Trump\u2019s national security orbit. She\u2019s orchestrated internal purges at the National Security Council and played a role in ousting NSA chief Gen. Timothy Haugh. Loomer is now publicly backing Trump\u2019s Iran escalation and attacking dissenters\u2014while remaining personally close to Trump.Why It Matters: Trump has empowered far-right conspiracy theorists like Loomer to shape foreign and domestic policy, replacing seasoned professionals with MAGA extremists.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Confirms July 9 Trade Deadline, Bessent Says Tariffs Will Snap Back August 1What Happened: Trump says countries must have \u201ca letter or a deal\u201d by July 9 or face steep tariffs by August 1\u2014reverting to April 2 levels. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that 100 countries will get formal tariff letters this week, warning of 10%\u201370% rates. So far, Trump has announced only a few vague deals, despite claiming he made 200.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s shifting deadlines, threats, and made-for-TV theatrics are fueling chaos in global trade. With few real deals and tariffs set to spike, consumers and businesses will soon feel more pain.Source: CNNU.S. seeks limited trade deal with E.U. as Trump\u2019s deadline approachesWhat Happened: With Trump\u2019s July 9 tariff deadline looming, talks between the U.S. and the E.U. are ongoing to avert harsh tariffs. Trump\u2019s go-it-alone approach bypasses global trade norms, discards WTO principles, and has yielded only 2 vague deals so far.Why It Matters: Trump is remaking global trade into a game of personal pressure and favoritism. The fallout: soaring prices for Americans, eroding legal predictability, and strained alliances with key partners like the European Union.Source: The Washington PostFrom lumber to lighting: How Trump's tariffs drive up home construction costsWhat Happened: An NBC News analysis found Trump\u2019s tariffs on materials from China, Canada, and Mexico are raising the cost of building a typical U.S. home by over $4,000\u2014potentially up to $10,900, according to industry estimates. Lumber, appliances, and electrical goods are among the most impacted.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are worsening the housing crisis, making new homes even less affordable.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Authoritarian Surveillance Continues Escalating \u2014 Trump\u2019s DHS is pushing illegal spying tactics, targeting activists, and purging oversight. This is a direct assault on civil liberties.The Deportation Machine Has No Mercy \u2014 Even breastfeeding moms and veterans\u2019 spouses are being swept up as Trump lies that he\u2019s targeting criminals.Propaganda Is Now Policy \u2014 Federal agencies like SSA are echoing Trump\u2019s lies, erasing the line between governance and political campaigning.The Electoral Field Is Being Reshaped \u2014 From redistricting schemes to mail voting crackdowns, Trump\u2019s GOP is actively working to undermine fair elections and entrench long-term power.Data Is Being Weaponized \u2014 Economic and health statistics are being manipulated or suppressed, echoing tactics used by authoritarian regimes like Russia to control public perception.Public Health Is Under Siege \u2014 With RFK Jr. leading HHS, anti-vaccine conspiracists are purging experts and dismantling science-based policy\u2014fueling deadly outbreaks and endangering all of us.Trump\u2019s Power Is Fueled by Fear and Chaos \u2014 Immigration raids, economic shocks, and media crackdowns are part of a deliberate strategy to destabilize society and consolidate control.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

GOP-led states like Kansas and North Dakota are now advancing laws to cut grace periods for mail voting.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is targeted voter suppression.
