  "content": "The Supreme Court is seen at dusk on January 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 16Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsVietnam Approves $1.5 Billion Investment Plan by Trump Organization and PartnerWhat Happened: Vietnam approved a $1.5 billion project by the Trump Organization and local partner Kinhbac City to build golf courses, resorts, and residential properties. Why It Matters: Trump is using the presidency to enrich himself. As he negotiates tariffs with Vietnam, his business is simultaneously profiting from deals with the Vietnamese government. It's a blatant conflict of interest and another example of Trump monetizing foreign policy for personal gain.Source: ReutersTrump Memecoin Dinner Winners Are Dumping Their CoinsWhat Happened: Nearly half of the top crypto holders who secured exclusive dinner access with Trump by purchasing large amounts of his TRUMP memecoin have already sold off their positions. Despite organizers offering a rare NFT to incentivize holding, 17 of the 25 VIPs\u2014including one who made $2.5 million\u2014have dumped or transferred their tokens.Why It Matters: The TRUMP coin was about buying access. The mass sell-off makes clear this was a pay-to-play scheme and exposes how Trump is selling off presidential influence to high bidders, opening the door to foreign money, corruption, and a total collapse of finance laws.Source: WIREDDOJ May Drop Criminal Case Against Boeing Over 737 Max Crashes, Sparking OutrageWhat Happened: The Justice Department is considering letting Boeing avoid criminal prosecution for the two deadly 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, instead offering a $444.5 million settlement for victims' families. The proposal follows a rejected plea deal and would scrap criminal charges entirely.Why It Matters: Victims\u2019 families are outraged, calling it a \u201cbackroom deal\u201d that lets corporate giants evade accountability. The move signals that even after mass fatalities, wealthy corporations can buy impunity from the DOJ.Source: NPRLatin American Leaders Spend Millions to Influence Trump\u2019s White HouseWhat Happened: Latin American leaders are spending millions on top U.S. lobbyists to curry favor with Trump, securing meetings, aid, and deals. El Salvador\u2019s Bukele landed a nuclear deal and money for his gulag; Argentina\u2019s Milei and Ecuador\u2019s Noboa used lobbying to gain photo ops and policy wins.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s transactional approach has opened the door to influence-for-access diplomacy, rewarding personal ties and lobbying over human rights and national security.Source: The GuardianSean Combs Allies Are Actively Working for a Trump PardonWhat Happened: As Sean Combs faces federal sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, his inner circle has begun discreetly lobbying Trump officials for a potential pardon or commutation. They\u2019re framing the case as politically motivated and leaning on Trump\u2019s ego and past ties to Combs to make their appeal.Why It Matters: The outreach underscores how Trump\u2019s pardon power continues to be courted by wealthy and influential figures seeking legal protection\u2014because he has shown time and again that presidential favors are for sale.Source: Rolling Stone\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDOGE tried assigning a team to the Government Accountability Office. It refusedWhat Happened: Musk attempted to embed staff inside the Government Accountability Office, citing Trump\u2019s executive order\u2014but GAO, an independent legislative branch agency, firmly rejected the request, asserting it is not subject to executive authority.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s attempted power grab continues to be a direct assault on the separation of powers. By trying to infiltrate Congress\u2019s top watchdog, Trump and Musk are testing the limits of authoritarian control and actively undermining the very institutions meant to keep it in check.Source: NPRTrump DOJ Moves to Merge ATF and DEA by OctoberWhat Happened: The Justice Department is advancing a plan to merge the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives with the Drug Enforcement Administration, with a target date as early as October. The merger would require congressional approval and changes to existing funding laws.Why It Matters: This would cripple two already underfunded agencies with vastly different missions while Trump\u2019s simultaneous budget cuts threaten to gut their core operations. It would also give Trump more centralized control over law enforcement tools he could weaponize for political ends.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Appointee Pressured Intel Analyst to Redo Report on Venezuelan GangWhat Happened: Joe Kent, a top adviser to Trump's intelligence director, told a senior analyst to \"rethink\" a report contradicting Trump\u2019s claim that Venezuela directs the Tren de Aragua gang. Intelligence agencies, except the FBI, found no state control. The report was later reaffirmed.Why It Matters: Trump officials tried to rewrite intelligence to justify the use of a wartime act for mass deportations by pressuring the analyst to alter the report. When he refused, they fired him.Source: New York TimesJames Comey Under Investigation for \u201c86 47\u201d Instagram PostWhat Happened: Former FBI Director James Comey is under Secret Service investigation after posting an image of seashells spelling \u201c86 47,\u201d which Trump allies claim is coded language for assassinating the 47th president. Comey deleted the post, saying he didn\u2019t intend violence and was unaware of that interpretation.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the government to punish enemies. Comey\u2019s beach photo is twisted into a threat to justify political retaliation.Source: CBS NewsTrump attorneys draw judge's ire by saying 'state secrets' keep them from sharing details on Abrego Garcia's returnWhat Happened: Federal Judge Paula Xinis sharply criticized Trump attorneys for stonewalling court-ordered disclosures in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Government lawyers invoked \u201cstate secrets\u201d to avoid explaining why they haven\u2019t complied with orders to bring him back.Why It Matters: Trump officials are defying the Supreme Court and hiding behind \u201cnational security\u201d to justify disappearances\u2014another sign of his regime\u2019s disregard for judicial authority, due process, and transparency.Source: NBC NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Asked EPA Employees to Snitch on Colleagues Working on DEI Initiatives. They Declined.What Happened: The EPA has urged employees to report colleagues involved in DEI programs. Despite the demand, not a single employee complied, according to records obtained by ProPublica.Why It Matters: The failed snitch line shows federal workers are quietly resisting Trump\u2019s purge. This echoes tactics seen in Russia and other autocratic regimes.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsRush of contracts on migrant crackdown exposes issues, contractors and experts sayWhat Happened: ICE has rushed out massive contracts to enforce Trump\u2019s deportation agenda\u2014some awarded without bids and others revoked after ethics complaints. A $73 million deal went to a firm run by a former Trump ICE official. Another $62 million contract went to a GOP-linked company just 13 days old.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation surge is fueling a corrupt gold rush. His cronies are cashing in through shady contracts, bypassing oversight and competition, while emergency powers are exploited to reward political insiders.Source: NBC NewsWhy U.S. Citizen Children Sent with Deported Moms Can\u2019t Easily ReturnWhat Happened: U.S.-born children are being deported alongside their undocumented parents. Though Trump officials claim families \u201cchose\u201d to bring their kids, attorneys argue many were misled or never given a choice, and now face legal and logistical barriers to return.Why It Matters: U.S. citizen children may have the right to return, but without passports, guardians, or resources, that right is hollow. Trump\u2019s coercive deportation tactics are stranding American kids abroad, in what advocates now call \u201cforced expatriation.\u201dSource: NBC NewsVenezuelans Deported by Trump Are Victims of \u2018Torture\u2019, Lawyers AllegeWhat Happened: Lawyers hired by Venezuela say 252 disappeared Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador\u2019s gulag are victims of physical and psychological torture. They\u2019ve filed habeas corpus petitions and requested proof of life but have been denied access by Bukele\u2019s government.Why It Matters: Trump is using emergency powers to disappear migrants without charges or hearings, mirroring authoritarian tactics. Accusations of gang ties are unproven, detentions are indefinite, and the UN warns of serious human rights violations.Source: The GuardianICE Used False \u2018Harboring\u2019 Claims to Target Columbia Students, Lawyers SayWhat Happened: ICE used a search warrant alleging Columbia University was \u201charboring aliens\u201d to raid student residences\u2014but lawyers say this was a pretext to arrest two students over their pro-Palestinian activism. One student, a green card holder, sued after learning ICE entered her residence under false pretenses.Why It Matters: Attorneys warn this is a dangerous escalation of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DHS and Rubio are allegedly revoking visas and green cards from student activists using false claims, bypassing due process. The ACLU says it\u2019s a direct threat to civil rights.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Legalizes Machine Gun\u2013Like Devices in Controversial SettlementWhat Happened: Trump officials settled a lawsuit with a gun rights group, effectively legalizing forced reset triggers\u2014devices that let semiautomatic guns fire like machine guns. The DOJ will return thousands of seized units and stop enforcing the machine gun ban against them.Why It Matters: This is a deadly backroom deal that will flood the market with more rapid-fire weapons and dismantle decades of some progress in gun safety laws. The move shows how far Trump will go to appease the gun lobby.Source: NBC NewsGOP Congressman Confirms Hegseth Ordered Cyber Pause Against Russia, Contradicting PentagonWhat Happened: Rep. Don Bacon publicly confirmed that U.S. cyber operations against Russia were paused for one day in February during Trump\u2019s push for a Russia deal, directly contradicting Pentagon denials. The order reportedly came from Pete Hegseth but was kept vague and downplayed by Trump officials.Why It Matters: This admission exposes another Trump cover-up and reiterates that national security tools are being compromised to appease Russia. It shows how Trump\u2019s fealty to Putin is quietly shaping U.S. defense policy.Source: CBS NewsFederal Reserve to Cut Staff by 10%, Powell Confirms in MemoWhat Happened: Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to reduce the central bank\u2019s workforce by 10% over the next few years, citing the need to \u201cmodernize\u201d and \u201cright-size\u201d operations. Why It Matters: Though Powell didn\u2019t name Musk, the move aligns with Trump\u2019s agenda to gut civil service. The Fed, long a target of Trump and Musk, is now joining other agencies under pressure to shrink.Source: CNBC\"I Feel Very Scared\": Americans Fear Trump\u2019s Medicaid Cuts Could Strip Vital CoverageWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s proposed 2026 budget includes $163 billion in Medicaid cuts and new work requirements, sparking fear among millions of vulnerable Americans. The Congressional Budget Office warns the plan could leave at least 8.6 million uninsured by 2034.Why It Matters: People depend on Medicaid for life-saving care and Trump\u2019s cuts threaten their health, dignity, and survival, offering tax breaks to the rich while making the poor choose between their health and food.Source: ABC NewsTrump Defunds Autism Research in DEI and 'Gender Ideology' PurgeWhat Happened: The National Institutes of Health has so far cut autism research funding by $31 million, in 2025, a 26% drop from the previous four-year average. Multiple projects were canceled for involving diverse populations, studying gender differences, or being housed at universities under Trump\u2019s scrutiny. Why It Matters: Autism researchers warn the cuts will delay vital progress, especially for underserved groups. While slashing proven science, RFK Jr. is redirecting funds to controversial theories like vaccine links\u2014replacing science with ideology.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Push to Defund Harvard Prompts Clash Over Veteran Suicide ResearchWhat Happened: Trump is canceling multiple Department of Veterans Affairs research contracts with Harvard University, part of a broader political crackdown on the school. Among the targeted programs is a suicide-prevention tool for emergency room doctors. V.A. officials have warned that the cuts could lead to preventable veteran deaths.Why It Matters: The cancellations are drawing internal dissent within the V.A. and raising alarms that critical research on veteran health, including mental health, cancer care, toxic exposure, and nutrition, is being gutted. Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump working on plan to move 1 million Palestinians to LibyaWhat Happened: Trump is reportedly exploring an insane and illegal plan to permanently move up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, in exchange for unfreezing billions in Libyan assets. Discussions have occurred with Libyan leadership, though no final deal is in place. Why It Matters: This would be ethnic cleansing. Forcibly relocating Palestinians would deepen regional instability and violate international law, while enabling Trump\u2019s stated goal of \u201cowning\u201d and building resorts in Gaza.Source: NBC NewsU.S. to Begin Talks on European Troop Reductions Later This Year, NATO Ambassador SaysWhat Happened: U.S. NATO Ambassador Matthew Whitaker confirmed that Trump will begin formal discussions on reducing American troop presence in Europe after the June NATO summit. While claiming the U.S. isn\u2019t withdrawing from NATO, Whitaker said Trump has \u201crun out of patience\u201d with allies and wants immediate action.Why It Matters: This shift would weaken NATO\u2019s eastern defenses and sends a green light to Russia to invade. Coupled with Trump\u2019s anti-ally rhetoric, fealty to Putin, and Ukraine aid cuts, he\u2019s preparing to dismantle the transatlantic alliance.Source: ReutersUS-Iran Nuclear Deal Could Fund Terrorism, Republicans WarnWhat Happened: Trump announced the U.S. is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, involving sanctions relief in exchange for curbing uranium enrichment. But over 300 GOP lawmakers have pushed back, warning the deal could free up funds for terrorism and embolden Iran\u2019s military and proxy forces.Why It Matters: The intra-party clash exposes deep Republican skepticism of diplomacy with Tehran, amid fears the deal would fail to restrain Iran\u2019s ambitions and destabilize the Middle East. Critics say the proposed agreement lacks enforceable limits and could increase human rights abuses and terrorism.Source: The Telegraph\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump\u2019s Ukraine Policy Pressured \u2018the Victim,\u2019 Former Ambassador SaysWhat Happened: Bridget A. Brink, who resigned last month as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, published an op-ed condemning Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy. She accused the White House of appeasing Russia and pressuring Ukraine, writing: \u201cPeace at any price is not peace at all \u2014 it is appeasement.\u201dWhy It Matters: Brink\u2019s resignation and public criticism highlight growing dissent within the U.S. diplomatic corps over Trump\u2019s approach to Russia and alliance with Moscow. Her warning that Trump is pressuring the victim instead of the aggressor underscores that U.S. policy is enabling Russia\u2019s continued genocidal invasion.Source: New York TimesEU Eyes Sanctions Targeting Nord Stream and Banking Sector to Pressure PutinWhat Happened: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU is preparing tougher sanctions on Russia, including targeting the Nord Stream pipelines, Russian banks, and Moscow\u2019s shadow oil fleet. The plan includes lowering the oil price cap and will be discussed at a summit in Albania.Why It Matters: The EU is preparing harsher sanctions\u2014but Trump hasn\u2019t backed them, insisting no \u201cdeal\u201d can happen without direct talks with Putin. As von der Leyen works with Senator Lindsey Graham on sanctions, Trump\u2019s provides cover to Putin to stall and dodge accountability.Source: PoliticoTrump\u2019s \u2018Weaponization\u2019 Lawyer Raised Cash for Violent Jan. 6 Militia MembersWhat Happened: Ed Martin, Trump\u2019s new pardon attorney and head of the DOJ\u2019s \u201cWeaponization Working Group,\u201d previously raised money for violent Jan. 6 insurrectionists through the Patriot Freedom Project. As interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., he fired key prosecutors.Why It Matters: A top Trump loyalist who raised cash for insurrectionists has been using federal power to punish their prosecutors. It\u2019s a reprehensible abuse of justice\u2014rewriting history, protecting violent insurrectionists, and turning the DOJ into a tool of authoritarian revenge \u2014 as Congress remains silent.Source: Rolling Stone'Lost Tourists' in the Forest Might Be Russian Spies, Latvia WarnsWhat Happened: Latvia\u2019s intelligence agency issued a public warning that individuals posing as lost tourists near military or infrastructure sites could be Russian saboteurs. The annual security report outlines tactics used by Russian operatives, including disguises, fake humanitarian roles, and efforts to incite unrest or conduct assassinations.Why It Matters: This alert reflects growing regional concern over covert Russian sabotage and terrorist operations aimed at destabilizing NATO\u2019s eastern front. Source: EuronewsThe Visionary of Trump 2.0: Russell Vought\u2019s Radical Mission to Remake AmericaWhat Happened: While Musk dismantles agencies, Trump\u2019s OMB chief, Russell Vought, is quietly enacting a sweeping plan to concentrate executive power. As a lead architect of Project 2025, he\u2019s targeting independent agencies, purging civil servants, and pushing a \u201cunitary executive\u201d doctrine that defies Congress and the courts.Why It Matters: Vought is building an authoritarian presidency behind the scenes. His methodical assault on checks and balances is as dangerous as Musk\u2019s chaos, replacing constitutional governance with raw executive control.Source: The Atlantic\u2696\ufe0f Supreme Court WatchSupreme Court Rejects Trump Bid to Resume Quick Deportations of Venezuelans Under 18th-Century LawWhat Happened: The Supreme Court blocked Trump\u2019s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to expedite disappearances of Venezuelan men labeled as \u201cgang members.\u201d In a 7\u20132 decision, the justices said due process was lacking and sent the case back to the 5th Circuit.Why It Matters: The ruling is a temporary blow to Trump\u2019s efforts to fast-track disappearances by abusing outdated laws. Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Says U.S. Will Unilaterally Set Tariff Rates for Dozens of CountriesWhat Happened: Trump announced the U.S. will soon send letters to many nations unilaterally imposing new tariff rates, citing a lack of capacity to negotiate individual trade deals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will handle the rollout.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move to unilaterally dictate tariffs marks a shift from negotiation to coercion, escalating global trade tensions. Walmart and others warn of rising prices, as their \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs wreak havoc on supply chains and consumer costs.Source: The GuardianMoody\u2019s Downgrades U.S. Credit Rating, Citing Soaring Debt and DeficitsWhat Happened: Moody\u2019s downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing unsustainable debt levels, rising interest costs, and a lack of political will to reverse massive federal deficits. Why It Matters: The downgrade is a major blow to Trump\u2019s economic credibility. It signals rising risk, surging interest costs, and weakening global trust in U.S. debt\u2014just as Republicans push a tax plan for the wealthy that will add trillions more to the deficit.Source: CNBCUS consumer sentiment slumps, households brace for inflation surgeWhat Happened: U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level since mid-2022 amid soaring inflation expectations and growing concerns about Trump\u2019s tariffs. The University of Michigan\u2019s May index fell to 50.8, with inflation expectations jumping to 7.3%\u2014a level not seen since 1981.Why It Matters: Even Republican sentiment declined, signaling unease within Trump\u2019s base. The slump highlights a pullback in consumer spending, raising fears the economy will slide into recession as businesses warn of shortages and price hikes. Source: ReutersU.S. Companies Surge Shipments from China Following Trump\u2019s Tariff PauseWhat Happened: After Trump announced a 90-day pause on heightened tariffs, U.S. freight bookings from China spiked nearly 300%\u2014the highest of the year. Businesses are rushing to import goods before tariffs potentially return to 145%, taking advantage of the temporary 30% rate.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade moves are destabilizing supply chains and inflating shipping costs. Big corporations can absorb the chaos\u2014small businesses can\u2019t, leaving them crushed by sudden tariff swings and logistical turmoil.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite Humanities Groups Sue Trump to Reverse Local Funding CutsWhat Happened: The Federation of State Humanities Councils and Oregon Council for the Humanities filed a federal lawsuit against Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE and the NEH, accusing them of unlawfully cutting congressionally mandated local humanities funding.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 16</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Vietnam Approves $1.5 Billion Investment Plan by Trump Organization and Partner</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Vietnam approved a $1.5 billion project by the Trump Organization and local partner Kinhbac City to build golf courses, resorts, and residential properties. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using the presidency to enrich himself. As he negotiates tariffs with Vietnam, his business is simultaneously profiting from deals with the Vietnamese government. It's a blatant conflict of interest and another example of Trump monetizing foreign policy for personal gain.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/vietnam-approves-15-billion-investment-plan-by-trump-organization-partner-2025-05-16/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Memecoin Dinner Winners Are Dumping Their Coins</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Nearly half of the top crypto holders who secured exclusive dinner access with Trump by purchasing large amounts of his TRUMP memecoin have already sold off their positions. Despite organizers offering a rare NFT to incentivize holding, 17 of the 25 VIPs\\u2014including one who made $2.5 million\\u2014have dumped or transferred their tokens.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The TRUMP coin was about buying access. The mass sell-off makes clear this was a pay-to-play scheme and exposes how Trump is selling off presidential influence to high bidders, opening the door to foreign money, corruption, and a total collapse of finance laws.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-trump-memecoin-dinner-winners-are-getting-rid-of-their-coins/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>DOJ May Drop Criminal Case Against Boeing Over 737 Max Crashes, Sparking Outrage</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department is considering letting Boeing avoid criminal prosecution for the two deadly 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, instead offering a $444.5 million settlement for victims' families. The proposal follows a rejected plea deal and would scrap criminal charges entirely.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Victims\\u2019 families are outraged, calling it a \\u201Cbackroom deal\\u201D that lets corporate giants evade accountability. The move signals that even after mass fatalities, wealthy corporations can buy impunity from the DOJ.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/g-s1-67245/doj-boeing-737-max-crashes-deal-prosecution-plane\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Latin American Leaders Spend Millions to Influence Trump\\u2019s White House</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Latin American leaders are spending millions on top U.S. lobbyists to curry favor with Trump, securing meetings, aid, and deals. El Salvador\\u2019s Bukele landed a nuclear deal and money for his gulag; Argentina\\u2019s Milei and Ecuador\\u2019s Noboa used lobbying to gain photo ops and policy wins.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s transactional approach has opened the door to influence-for-access diplomacy, rewarding personal ties and lobbying over human rights and national security.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/16/trump-bukele-milei-south-america-lobby\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Sean Combs Allies Are Actively Working for a Trump Pardon</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As Sean Combs faces federal sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, his inner circle has begun discreetly lobbying Trump officials for a potential pardon or commutation. They\\u2019re framing the case as politically motivated and leaning on Trump\\u2019s ego and past ties to Combs to make their appeal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The outreach underscores how Trump\\u2019s pardon power continues to be courted by wealthy and influential figures seeking legal protection\\u2014because he has shown time and again that presidential favors are for sale.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/publish/post/163751633\\\\\\\">Rolling Stone</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>DOGE tried assigning a team to the Government Accountability Office. It refused</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk attempted to embed staff inside the Government Accountability Office, citing Trump\\u2019s executive order\\u2014but GAO, an independent legislative branch agency, firmly rejected the request, asserting it is not subject to executive authority.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s attempted power grab continues to be a direct assault on the separation of powers. By trying to infiltrate Congress\\u2019s top watchdog, Trump and Musk are testing the limits of authoritarian control and actively undermining the very institutions meant to keep it in check.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/16/nx-s1-5401008/doge-gao-congress\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump DOJ Moves to Merge ATF and DEA by October</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department is advancing a plan to merge the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives with the Drug Enforcement Administration, with a target date as early as October. The merger would require congressional approval and changes to existing funding laws.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would cripple two already underfunded agencies with vastly different missions while Trump\\u2019s simultaneous budget cuts threaten to gut their core operations. It would also give Trump more centralized control over law enforcement tools he could weaponize for political ends.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-takes-next-steps-merge-atf-dea-sources-say-2025-05-16/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Appointee Pressured Intel Analyst to Redo Report on Venezuelan Gang</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Joe Kent, a top adviser to Trump's intelligence director, told a senior analyst to \\\\\\\"rethink\\\\\\\" a report contradicting Trump\\u2019s claim that Venezuela directs the Tren de Aragua gang. Intelligence agencies, except the FBI, found no state control. The report was later reaffirmed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump officials tried to rewrite intelligence to justify the use of a wartime act for mass deportations by pressuring the analyst to alter the report. When he refused, they fired him.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/trump-appointee-venezuela-gang.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>James Comey Under Investigation for \\u201C86 47\\u201D Instagram Post</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Former FBI Director James Comey is under Secret Service investigation after posting an image of seashells spelling \\u201C86 47,\\u201D which Trump allies claim is coded language for assassinating the 47th president. Comey deleted the post, saying he didn\\u2019t intend violence and was unaware of that interpretation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the government to punish enemies. Comey\\u2019s beach photo is twisted into a threat to justify political retaliation.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-under-investigation-posting-deleting-86-47-instagram-noem-says/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump attorneys draw judge's ire by saying 'state secrets' keep them from sharing details on Abrego Garcia's return</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Federal Judge Paula Xinis sharply criticized Trump attorneys for stonewalling court-ordered disclosures in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Government lawyers invoked \\u201Cstate secrets\\u201D to avoid explaining why they haven\\u2019t complied with orders to bring him back.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump officials are defying the Supreme Court and hiding behind \\u201Cnational security\\u201D to justify disappearances\\u2014another sign of his regime\\u2019s disregard for judicial authority, due process, and transparency.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/kilmar-abrego-garcia-hearing-trump-attorneys-el-salvador-deportation-rcna207346\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Asked EPA Employees to Snitch on Colleagues Working on DEI Initiatives.

Despite the demand, not a single employee complied, according to records obtained by <em>ProPublica</em>.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The failed snitch line shows federal workers are quietly resisting Trump\\u2019s purge. This echoes tactics seen in Russia and other autocratic regimes.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/epa-diversity-initiatives-trump\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Rush of contracts on migrant crackdown exposes issues, contractors and experts say</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE has rushed out massive contracts to enforce Trump\\u2019s deportation agenda\\u2014some awarded without bids and others revoked after ethics complaints. A $73 million deal went to a firm run by a former Trump ICE official. Another $62 million contract went to a GOP-linked company just 13 days old.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s deportation surge is fueling a corrupt gold rush. His cronies are cashing in through shady contracts, bypassing oversight and competition, while emergency powers are exploited to reward political insiders.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/rush-contracts-migrant-crackdown-exposes-issues-contractors-experts-sa-rcna203558\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Why U.S. Citizen Children Sent with Deported Moms Can\\u2019t Easily Return</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> U.S.-born children are being deported alongside their undocumented parents. Though Trump officials claim families \\u201Cchose\\u201D to bring their kids, attorneys argue many were misled or never given a choice, and now face legal and logistical barriers to return.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> U.S. citizen children may have the right to return, but without passports, guardians, or resources, that right is hollow. Trump\\u2019s coercive deportation tactics are stranding American kids abroad, in what advocates now call \\u201Cforced expatriation.\\u201D</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/deported-parents-us-citizen-children-return-legal-ice-marco-rubio-rcna207223\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Venezuelans Deported by Trump Are Victims of \\u2018Torture\\u2019, Lawyers Allege</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Lawyers hired by Venezuela say 252 disappeared Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador\\u2019s gulag are victims of physical and psychological torture. They\\u2019ve filed habeas corpus petitions and requested proof of life but have been denied access by Bukele\\u2019s government.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using emergency powers to disappear migrants without charges or hearings, mirroring authoritarian tactics. Accusations of gang ties are unproven, detentions are indefinite, and the UN warns of serious human rights violations.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/16/venezuelans-deported-trump-lawyers-torture\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>ICE Used False \\u2018Harboring\\u2019 Claims to Target Columbia Students, Lawyers Say</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE used a search warrant alleging Columbia University was \\u201Charboring aliens\\u201D to raid student residences\\u2014but lawyers say this was a pretext to arrest two students over their pro-Palestinian activism. One student, a green card holder, sued after learning ICE entered her residence under false pretenses.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Attorneys warn this is a dangerous escalation of Trump\\u2019s immigration crackdown. DHS and Rubio are allegedly revoking visas and green cards from student activists using false claims, bypassing due process.

The DOJ will return thousands of seized units and stop enforcing the machine gun ban against them.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a deadly backroom deal that will flood the market with more rapid-fire weapons and dismantle decades of some progress in gun safety laws.

Don Bacon publicly confirmed that U.S. cyber operations against Russia were paused for one day in February during Trump\\u2019s push for a Russia deal, directly contradicting Pentagon denials. The order reportedly came from Pete Hegseth but was kept vague and downplayed by Trump officials.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This admission exposes another Trump cover-up and reiterates that national security tools are being compromised to appease Russia. It shows how Trump\\u2019s fealty to Putin is quietly shaping U.S. defense policy.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-congressman-don-bacon-hegseth-ordered-pause-cyber-operations-against-russia/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Federal Reserve to Cut Staff by 10%, Powell Confirms in Memo</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to reduce the central bank\\u2019s workforce by 10% over the next few years, citing the need to \\u201Cmodernize\\u201D and \\u201Cright-size\\u201D operations. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Though Powell didn\\u2019t name Musk, the move aligns with Trump\\u2019s agenda to gut civil service.

The Congressional Budget Office warns the plan could leave at least 8.6 million uninsured by 2034.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> People depend on Medicaid for life-saving care and Trump\\u2019s cuts threaten their health, dignity, and survival, offering tax breaks to the rich while making the poor choose between their health and food.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/feel-scared-americans-fear-losing-coverage-due-proposed/story?id=121793330\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Defunds Autism Research in DEI and 'Gender Ideology' Purge</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The National Institutes of Health has so far cut autism research funding by $31 million, in 2025, a 26% drop from the previous four-year average. Multiple projects were canceled for involving diverse populations, studying gender differences, or being housed at universities under Trump\\u2019s scrutiny. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Autism researchers warn the cuts will delay vital progress, especially for underserved groups. While slashing proven science, RFK Jr. is redirecting funds to controversial theories like vaccine links\\u2014replacing science with ideology.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-administration-cut-autism-related-research-by-26-so-far-2025-2025-05-16/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s Push to Defund Harvard Prompts Clash Over Veteran Suicide Research</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is canceling multiple Department of Veterans Affairs research contracts with Harvard University, part of a broader political crackdown on the school. Among the targeted programs is a suicide-prevention tool for emergency room doctors. V.A. officials have warned that the cuts could lead to preventable veteran deaths.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The cancellations are drawing internal dissent within the V.A. and raising alarms that critical research on veteran health, including mental health, cancer care, toxic exposure, and nutrition, is being gutted. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/trump-harvard-veterans-research.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump working on plan to move 1 million Palestinians to Libya</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is reportedly exploring an insane and illegal plan to permanently move up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, in exchange for unfreezing billions in Libyan assets. Discussions have occurred with Libyan leadership, though no final deal is in place. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would be ethnic cleansing. Forcibly relocating Palestinians would deepen regional instability and violate international law, while enabling Trump\\u2019s stated goal of \\u201Cowning\\u201D and building resorts in Gaza.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-working-plan-move-1-million-palestinians-libya-rcna207224\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>U.S. to Begin Talks on European Troop Reductions Later This Year, NATO Ambassador Says</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> U.S. NATO Ambassador Matthew Whitaker confirmed that Trump will begin formal discussions on reducing American troop presence in Europe after the June NATO summit. While claiming the U.S. isn\\u2019t withdrawing from NATO, Whitaker said Trump has \\u201Crun out of patience\\u201D with allies and wants immediate action.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shift would weaken NATO\\u2019s eastern defenses and sends a green light to Russia to invade. Coupled with Trump\\u2019s anti-ally rhetoric, fealty to Putin, and Ukraine aid cuts, he\\u2019s preparing to dismantle the transatlantic alliance.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-start-european-troop-withdrawal-discussions-later-this-year-us-nato-2025-05-16/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>US-Iran Nuclear Deal Could Fund Terrorism, Republicans Warn</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced the U.S. is nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, involving sanctions relief in exchange for curbing uranium enrichment. But over 300 GOP lawmakers have pushed back, warning the deal could free up funds for terrorism and embolden Iran\\u2019s military and proxy forces.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The intra-party clash exposes deep Republican skepticism of diplomacy with Tehran, amid fears the deal would fail to restrain Iran\\u2019s ambitions and destabilize the Middle East. Critics say the proposed agreement lacks enforceable limits and could increase human rights abuses and terrorism.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/05/16/us-iran-nuclear-deal-could-fund-terrorism-republicans-fear/\\\\\\\">The Telegraph</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF0D Far-Right &amp; Russian Influence Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump\\u2019s Ukraine Policy Pressured \\u2018the Victim,\\u2019 Former Ambassador Says</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Bridget A. Brink, who resigned last month as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, published an op-ed condemning Trump\\u2019s Ukraine policy. She accused the White House of appeasing Russia and pressuring Ukraine, writing: \\u201CPeace at any price is not peace at all \\u2014 it is appeasement.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Brink\\u2019s resignation and public criticism highlight growing dissent within the U.S. diplomatic corps over Trump\\u2019s approach to Russia and alliance with Moscow. Her warning that Trump is pressuring the victim instead of the aggressor underscores that U.S. policy is enabling Russia\\u2019s continued genocidal invasion.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/ukraine-ambassador-brink-trump.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>EU Eyes Sanctions Targeting Nord Stream and Banking Sector to Pressure Putin</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU is preparing tougher sanctions on Russia, including targeting the Nord Stream pipelines, Russian banks, and Moscow\\u2019s shadow oil fleet.
