The group condemned Serbia\u2019s decision to revoke historic protection from NATO-bombed defense buildings to make way for the project, calling demolition \u201cnot an option.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s project is at the center of a political and legal firestorm. It\u2019s sparking mass protests against Serbian President Vu\u010di\u0107, who supports the deal, and has already triggered a criminal forgery arrest in the heritage office. The scandal shows how authoritarian regimes twist public institutions to serve corrupt cronies and foreign interests.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsUS supreme court limits federal judges\u2019 power to block Trump ordersWhat Happened: The Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 to limit federal judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, allowing Trump\u2019s ban on birthright citizenship to proceed in part. Judges can now only block enforcement for those directly involved in lawsuits, weakening judicial checks on presidential orders.Why It Matters: The Supreme Court handed Trump another dangerous expansion of executive power. The ruling lets him sidestep the Constitution for anyone who hasn\u2019t sued\u2014shredding the 14th Amendment and opening the door to selective enforcement of citizenship. Source: The Guardian and New York TimesTrump may name a \u2018shadow\u2019 Fed chair, an unprecedented development in American historyWhat Happened: Trump plans to name a \u201cshadow\u201d Federal Reserve chair nearly a year before Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends, an unprecedented move meant to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates. He\u2019s publicly demanding a loyalist who will lower rates, despite market concerns and backlash from former Fed officials.Why It Matters: This would politicize the Fed like never before\u2014undermining its independence, fueling market instability, and risking internal revolt. Trump is trying to hijack monetary policy, destroying trust in one of the last institutions still viewed as apolitical.Source: CNNTrump Eyes Cuts to Top Spy Agency as He Downplays Iran IntelWhat Happened: Trump wants to gut the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, purging staff and sidelining Tulsi Gabbard after she didn\u2019t echo his Iran claims strongly enough. Cuts have already hit 25%, with more on the table as Trump elevates CIA Director John Ratcliffe instead.Why It Matters: This risks crippling the U.S. intelligence system. The DNI was created to prevent another 9/11, and Trump wants to dismantle it over personal grudges. With rising threats from Iran and elsewhere, the U.S. will be significantly and intentionally weakened.Source: Bloomberg\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEx-DOGE Operative \u2018Big Balls\u2019 Lands New Job at Social Security AdministrationWhat Happened: Edward Coristine, the 19-year-old former Musk operative known as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d has been hired by the Social Security Administration after resigning from unauthorized DOGE. Coristine, with a shady past and no vetting, will now help manage SSA tech infrastructure.Why It Matters: Trump continues rewarding loyalty over competence, placing inexperienced, controversial figures in key agencies overseeing vital services. It\u2019s a continued hostile takeover of the civil service, with ideologues and extremists replacing career experts.Source: The GuardianJustice Department abruptly fires 3 prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 criminal casesWhat Happened: The DOJ abruptly fired three more prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions, including two supervisors and a line attorney, without explanation. The move follows earlier demotions and firings of dozens involved in Capitol riot cases, many of whom helped convict Proud Boys and Oath Keepers leaders for seditious conspiracy.Why It Matters: The Justice Department is purging career attorneys who pursued accountability for the Capitol insurrection\u2014an attack Trump incited. By eliminating those tied to Jan. 6 prosecutions, he is rewriting history and dismantling the rule of law from within.Source: Associated PressDOGE enters ATF with mandate to slash gun regulationsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE is gutting over 50 gun regulations at the ATF and purging nearly 70% of its inspectors. Background check forms are being shortened, and detailed safety questions removed. Kash Patel briefly led the agency before being replaced by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling federal gun oversight, giving the gun lobby free rein. With inspections slashed and safeguards removed, gun traffickers and criminals will face fewer barriers\u2014while Americans will be endangered.Source: Washington PostStar witness against Kilmar Abrego Garcia won\u2019t be deported, court records showWhat Happened: Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, a felon and key witness in a smuggling case, was granted a one-year reprieve to stay in the U.S. in exchange for his testimony. Despite past deportations and a conviction, he was released early from prison to \u201caid\u201d the federal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia.Why It Matters: Trump officials are shielding criminals when politically useful, while others are denied due process.

Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged for visiting an ICE facility, Sen. Alex Padilla was detained and forcibly removed from a DHS event, and House Democrats have been denied access to detention centers and had staffers detained. Facing arrests, surveillance, and legal threats, many Democrats are seeking legal counsel and security escorts for official visits.Why It Matters: Oversight is being criminalized, as Trump uses federal power to silence dissent and block investigations, turning basic constitutional duties into acts of defiance. Source: Associated PressProminent L.A. politico detained upon return from international trip, report saysWhat Happened: Rick Taylor, a veteran California political consultant who once helped elect Senator Alex Padilla, was detained for secondary screening by CBP at Miami airport after a family vacation. Unlike his wife and daughter, he was flagged for being from California and held in a room largely filled with Latino families, with no explanation.Why It Matters: This further shows how Trump\u2019s politicized federal agencies are using geography and perceived political leanings to justify detentions. It mirrors authoritarian tactics\u2014intimidating dissenters and punishing residents of blue states through surveillance and arbitrary targeting.Source: KTLA\u2018No right is safe\u2019: Justice Sotomayor dissents on birthright rulingWhat Happened: Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a rare dissent from the bench after the Supreme Court let Trump\u2019s order curbing birthright citizenship take effect in states that haven\u2019t sued. She blasted the decision as a threat to the 14th Amendment and judicial oversight of illegal executive actions.Why It Matters: This ruling guts constitutional safeguards by making rights contingent on lawsuits. If birthright citizenship can be bypassed until someone sues, so can any right.

Liberal justices issued urgent dissents, warning that the Court is enabling unchecked executive power.Why It Matters: The Court is gutting judicial oversight and turning constitutional rights into privileges only enforceable through individual or class action lawsuits. Justice Jackson called it an \u201cexistential threat to the rule of law\u201d\u2014a warning that nationwide protections are vanishing under the weight of unchecked executive power.Source: The GuardianUVA President Resigns Under Trump Pressure on DEIWhat Happened: University of Virginia president James Ryan resigned after Trump officials demanded his ouster over the school\u2019s DEI policies. Ryan said staying would risk funding, jobs, student visas, and aid. DOJ warned UVA over \u201cwidespread\u201d race-based practices.Why It Matters: Trump continues forcing ideological purges at universities, threatening academic freedom and civil rights. DEI programs are being dismantled nationwide under political pressure, with UVA another high-profile casualty.Source: ReutersTrump Threatens to Find Tillis Challenger for Key Senate SeatWhat Happened: After Sen. Thom Tillis opposed Trump\u2019s tax bill over cuts to Medicaid and clean energy, Trump threatened to back a primary challenger. He posted on Truth Social about meeting potential replacements. Shortly after, under pressure, Tillis announced he wouldn\u2019t run for reelection in 2026.Why It Matters: Trump continues to purge the disloyal and reward obedience.

The mother is now suing ICE and Trump, arguing the arrest violates due process.Why It Matters: Cruelty is the policy. Trump\u2019s ICE is targeting families and sick children\u2014using a courthouse arrest to detain a mother and her dying son with leukemia. It\u2019s a blatant abuse of power designed to terrorize immigrants and meet quotas.Source: KTLAMother and Children Caught in Violent Federal Raid; Suspect Not HomeWhat Happened: Federal agents used explosives to raid a Huntington Park home searching for Jorge Sierra-Hernandez, accused of \u201cramming\u201d a CBP vehicle during a protest. Instead, they found his girlfriend and young children inside. This marks the second such botched raid this month in the area.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is endangering innocent families. Armed raids with explosives are being deployed in residential neighborhoods spreading fear and trauma among Latino communities.

Native tribes, environmentalists, and immigrant rights groups have condemned the project as dangerous and inhumane.Why It Matters: Trump and DeSantis are using state power and FEMA funds to normalize horrid conditions.

He was found unresponsive and declared dead shortly after. Noviello had been detained following a drug conviction and was awaiting removal proceedings.Why It Matters: Noviello\u2019s death marks the 10th in ICE custody this year\u2014evidence of the human rights violations from Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. As arrests surge, oversight and humanitarian concerns inside detention centers are intensifying.Source: New York TimesImmigration officers arrest Iranian asylum-seekers in Los AngelesWhat Happened: Federal immigration agents in Los Angeles arrested two Iranian asylum-seekers from a Farsi-speaking Christian church. One woman suffered a panic attack during the raid. The arrests followed U.S. airstrikes on Iran and were part of a wider sweep that detained 11 Iranians over the weekend. Congregants are now too afraid to return to church.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s war spilling into American cities. Iranian refugees fleeing persecution are being hunted in their homes and churches\u2014treated as enemies without trial. Source: ReutersNew Army Shaving Policy Will Allow Soldiers with Skin Condition that Affects Mostly Black Men to Be Kicked OutWhat Happened: The Army is rolling out a policy that could expel soldiers with chronic shaving-related skin conditions, like pseudofolliculitis barbae, which disproportionately affects Black men. The policy ends permanent shaving waivers and threatens discharge for those needing more than 12 months of exemption in two years.Why It Matters: This move targets Black soldiers under the guise of grooming standards, despite no tactical necessity. Critics call it racially motivated and note it could worsen the Army\u2019s recruitment crisis, especially as the Pentagon slashes diversity efforts and pushes out medically impacted troops.Source: Military.comHegseth Renames USNS Harvey Milk, Sparks BacklashWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, stripping the gay rights pioneer\u2019s name during Pride Month and rebranding the ship after WWII Medal of Honor recipient Oscar V. Peterson.Why It Matters: Critics call the move a politically charged erasure of LGBTQ history. Stuart Milk, Harvey\u2019s nephew, condemned it as \u201ca big step back.\u201d Advocates say Hegseth is pushing a culture war agenda under the guise of depoliticization, while ignoring the power of diversity in the armed forces.Source: ABC NewsHow Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two MonthsWhat Happened: Trump has gutted decades of civil rights enforcement\u2014shuttering agencies, halting anti-discrimination investigations, and slashing protections in housing, education, labor, and the environment. He revoked Lyndon Johnson\u2019s executive order, ended \u201cdisparate impact\u201d liability, and is using civil rights law to attack DEI programs instead of racism.Why It Matters: This is a full-scale assault on civil rights. Trump is weaponizing federal power to punish inclusion efforts and elevate white grievance\u2014reversing decades of hard-won progress. The message is clear: discrimination won\u2019t just be tolerated, it will be protected and enforced.Source: New York TimesMan Born on Army Base to US Soldier Deported to JamaicaWhat Happened: Jermaine Thomas, born on a U.S. Army base in Germany to a naturalized American soldier, was deported to Jamaica\u2014despite not being a citizen there. Trump officials deemed him deportable due to unresolved citizenship paperwork and past criminal charges, rendering him effectively stateless.Why It Matters: Thomas\u2019s deportation exposes the chaos in Trump\u2019s mass removal agenda, which now targets even those born into military families. With the Supreme Court clearing the way for state-level restrictions on birthright citizenship, more stateless deportations will follow.Source: NewsweekDHS terminates temporary protected status for Haitians in the USWhat Happened: Kristi Noem announced the end of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, effective Sept. 2, putting up to 500,000 people at risk of deportation despite rampant gang violence in Haiti. DHS claims conditions have improved, even as the U.S. State Department warns Americans not to travel there.Why It Matters: The move is part of Trump\u2019s broader anti-immigration crackdown and singles out a population he\u2019s long vilified. Ending TPS for Haitians defies U.S. security warnings and paves the way for mass expulsions\u2014disregarding safety, stability, and basic human rights.Source: PoliticoTrump\u2019s \"divide and conquer\" approach to LGBTQ rightsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s second term is targeting transgender Americans and gutting broader LGBTQ protections. His regime banned gender identity on documents, cut LGBTQ program funding, erased trans references from federal sites, shut down suicide lines, and banned LGBTQ books in military schools\u2014following the Project 2025 playbook.Why It Matters: Trump is scapegoating trans people to divide the LGBTQ community and lay the groundwork to roll back rights like marriage equality. Visibility is vanishing, protections are collapsing, and the rhetoric from the top is fueling a dangerous climate.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchUS sees spate of arrests of civilians impersonating Ice officersWhat Happened: Arrests of civilians impersonating ICE agents are spiking nationwide, from California to North Carolina. Recent cases involve armed suspects using fake DHS documents, threatening immigrants, and even committing sexual assault\u2014enabled by Trump\u2019s policy of sending masked, plainclothes federal agents to conduct raids and arrests in unmarked vehicles.Why It Matters: When the state blurs the line between legal and illegal force, chaos follows. Trump\u2019s secretive, masked deportation squads are making it easier for vigilantes and criminals to mimic law enforcement, putting immigrants and all of us at risk.Source: The GuardianG.O.P. Bill Has $1.1 Trillion in Health Cuts and 11.8 Million Losing Care, C.B.O.

The bill adds work requirements, curbs provider support, and weakens rural health funding.Why It Matters: This is the biggest assault on Medicaid in its history. Millions\u2014especially low-income families, seniors, disabled, and rural Americans\u2014will lose coverage. All to implement tax breaks for the wealthy.Source: New York Times\u2018You open the fridge \u2013 nothing\u2019: renewed threat of US hunger as Trump seeks to cut food aidWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill slashes up to $300 billion from SNAP, America\u2019s largest food assistance program, to help fund tax breaks for the wealthy. The cuts would impose strict new work requirements on parents of children as young as 7 and older adults aged 55\u201364, threatening aid for up to 8 million people.Why It Matters: Hunger is being legislated back into American life. In one of the richest countries, Trump\u2019s cuts will force working families back into food insecurity. The Trump plan will feed billionaires and starve the poor.Source: The GuardianNo One Is in Charge at the U.S. Copyright OfficeWhat Happened: The U.S. Copyright Office is leaderless during one of the most critical moments in its history. Trump fired Register Shira Perlmutter and Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden by email in May, replacing them with loyalists who never showed up to work. Perlmutter is suing, arguing only the Librarian can remove her, while chaos reigns inside the office\u2014copyright certificates are being issued unsigned, sparking legal concerns, and major AI rulings remain in limbo.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s takeover of the Copyright Office is creating chaos. With unsigned certificates, halted rulings, and unqualified loyalists in charge, the legal backbone of music, film, publishing, and AI innovation is cracking.Source: WIREDStates Fear Critical Funding From FEMA May Be Drying UpWhat Happened: Trump has stalled billions in FEMA grant funding, blown past legal deadlines, and begun dismantling core programs critical to emergency preparedness. Kristi Noem now personally reviews any FEMA grants over $100,000, slowing operations to a crawl. Trump has signaled plans to gut FEMA entirely after hurricane season, even as states rely on it for up to 99% of their emergency budgets.Why It Matters: FEMA is the backbone of disaster response, and starving it of funding leaves millions vulnerable to floods, fires, and hurricanes. Without it, rural and poor counties will be defenseless, and future catastrophes will become mass-casualty failures.Source: ProPublica\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUN nuclear watchdog chief says Iran could again begin enriching uranium in \u2018matter of months\u2019What Happened: IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi contradicted Trump\u2019s claims that U.S. strikes \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program, stating Iran retains the capacity to resume uranium enrichment within months. His comments align with a Pentagon assessment that the strikes caused serious\u2014but not total\u2014damage.Why It Matters: Despite Trump boasting about ending Iran\u2019s nuclear threat, evidence shows Tehran\u2019s program is weakened but not broken\u2014and could rebound quickly. As Iran moves to cut off international oversight, the risk of nuclear escalation is rising.Source: CNNTrump Suggests Billions in U.S. Aid to Israel Tied to Netanyahu\u2019s Corruption TrialWhat Happened: Trump lashed out at Israeli prosecutors, calling Netanyahu\u2019s corruption trial a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and implying that continued U.S. aid to Israel could depend on dropping the charges. He praised Netanyahu as a \u201cwar hero\u201d and said America \u201cis not going to stand for this,\u201d referencing billions in U.S. support.Why It Matters: Trump is openly tying foreign aid to personal loyalty\u2014pressuring an allied democracy\u2019s legal system to protect his political ally. It\u2019s a brazen abuse of power and a return to extortion tactics, echoing his first impeachment.

Speaking from the NATO summit in The Hague, Tsahkna called for tougher EU sanctions, $47 billion in European military aid, and the seizure of $240 billion in frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. Why It Matters: Tsahkna\u2019s blunt warning underscores a stark truth: Putin will continue to escalate until stopped. The West\u2019s failure to decisively back Ukraine risks emboldening future Russian aggression, especially against NATO countries. With Trump weakening U.S. commitment, Europe must step up or risk repeating history.Source: The Kyiv IndependentIran Carries Out String of Executions and Arrests Amid Fears of Infiltration of Israeli SpiesWhat Happened: Iran executed three Kurdish men accused of aiding Israel in the 2020 killing of a nuclear scientist and arrested over 700 others amid fears of espionage following the recent Iran-Israel war. Human rights groups warn more executions are imminent, including Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was moved to an undisclosed location.Source: TIMETrump exploring $30 billion civilian nuclear deal for IranWhat Happened: Trump is quietly considering a proposal to offer Iran up to $30 billion in civilian nuclear assistance and unlock frozen assets in exchange for halting uranium enrichment. While Trump publicly called the idea a \u201choax,\u201d he also confirmed he was exploring sanctions relief and said Tehran \u201cwants to meet\u201d to make a deal.Why It Matters: This would be a stunning reversal of Trump\u2019s 2018 decision to scrap Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear deal. The same man who once denounced Obama for giving Iran \u201ccash for terror\u201d is now flirting with doing exactly that.Source: NBC News \ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Amasses 50,000 Troops Around Sumy, Putting Ukraine in Precarious PositionWhat Happened: Russia has massed 50,000 troops near Sumy, just 12 miles from the city, opening a new front.

Most were decoys, but only one of seven ballistic missiles was shot down. Why It Matters: Russia is overwhelming Ukraine\u2019s defenses with mass decoy attacks to drain interceptors before striking hard. As Russia murders more Ukrainians, Zelenskyy is pleading for more Patriot systems\u2014while Trump continues to provide cover for Russia and stall U.S. aid, giving Moscow a deadly advantage.Source: New York TimesGermany Scrambles Jets to Intercept Russian Spy Plane Near NATO AirspaceWhat Happened: Last week, German Eurofighter jets intercepted a Russian Il-20M reconnaissance aircraft flying from Kaliningrad toward NATO airspace with its transponder off.

He accused Powell of suffering from \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d and promised to name a successor who will cut rates.Why It Matters: Trump continues pressuring the Fed to serve his political goals, undermining the central bank\u2019s independence.

The drop follows a surge in preemptive purchases ahead of Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. Core inflation rose 0.2%, with year-over-year rates hitting 2.7%, while incomes dipped 0.4%.Why It Matters: The spending slowdown and rising prices point to mounting economic uncertainty.

Facing arrests, surveillance, and legal threats, many Democrats are seeking legal counsel and security escorts for official visits.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Oversight is being criminalized, as Trump uses federal power to silence dissent and block investigations, turning basic constitutional duties into acts of defiance. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/democrats-oversight-trump-ice-immigration-5c53e382cc752c9192e12e5ecd9bcef7\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Prominent L.A. politico detained upon return from international trip, report says</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Rick Taylor, a veteran California political consultant who once helped elect Senator Alex Padilla, was detained for secondary screening by CBP at Miami airport after a family vacation.
