I\u2019ll be posting today\u2019s later tonight.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsDOGE Deal With Labor Dept Reveals $1.3M Fee and Expansive Surveillance RoleWhat Happened: A leaked agreement shows the Department of Labor will pay Musk and his operatives $1.3 million for tech services\u2014including access to sensitive government systems. Despite Musk\u2019s lies that unauthorized FAKE DOGE would cost taxpayers nothing, the deal outlines an 18-month contract and unprecedented access to agency infrastructure.Why It Matters: This contradicts promises of cost-free \u201cefficiency\u201d and shows Musk's purpose in embedding operatives across agencies under the guise of modernization while wielding access and influence beyond legal or ethical norms. This is not reform. It\u2019s infiltration.Source: WIREDTrump\u2019s \u2018buy\u2019 tip on social media before his tariffs pause made money for investors who listenedWhat Happened: Hours before announcing a 90-day tariff pause that sent markets soaring, Trump posted \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\u201d on Truth Social. The S&P 500 jumped 9.5%, with Trump Media stock skyrocketing 22.7%, netting Trump\u2014via his 53% stake\u2014over $400 million in a day.Why It Matters: This suggests that Trump used insider knowledge to manipulate markets and enrich himself and his allies. Ethics experts are calling it market manipulation in plain sight. This is the kind of authoritarian power play you\u2019d expect in a kleptocracy, not a democracy.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsGabbard\u2019s Counterterror Pick Tied to Far-Right Paramilitary GroupWhat Happened: Joe Kent, Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s choice to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, has a long record of extremist ties\u2014including support for 1st Amendment Praetorian, a paramilitary group linked to January 6 actors. Kent also has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and associating with white nationalists and QAnon-aligned figures.Why It Matters: Another extremist in a top position showing Trump\u2019s normalization of violent far-right extremist ideology inside national security. Kent is now tasked with monitoring threats\u2014including domestic terrorism\u2014despite deep ties to extremist movements that pose the dangers he\u2019s supposed to protect America against.Source: Mother JonesTrump Signs Order Targeting Law Firm Behind $787.5M Fox SettlementWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order punishing Susman Godfrey, the firm that helped Dominion Voting Systems win its $787.5 million defamation settlement from Fox News. The order strips the firm of security clearances, federal access, and the ability to represent clients in government matters.Why It Matters: This is a blatant act of retaliation against lawyers who held Trump sycophants accountable for spreading dangerous 2020 election lies. It\u2019s an assault on the legal system\u2014weaponizing executive power to punish dissent and intimidate those who challenge him and his cronies in court.Source: The GuardianTrump and DOGE Are \u2018Trying to Get Around\u2019 Privacy Laws to Gather Your Personal InfoWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s operatives have accessed massive amounts of sensitive personal data across federal agencies\u2014including Social Security, Treasury, and OPM\u2014despite court rulings, privacy laws, and widespread outrage.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are building a vast surveillance apparatus, violating the Privacy Act to collect data on millions, including judges, immigrants, and political opponents\u2014 and using executive orders to crush oversight. A classic authoritarian tactic.Source: Rolling Stone\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump orders DoJ to investigate duo who debunked claims of election fraudWhat Happened: Trump ordered the Department of Justice to investigate 2 former officials\u2014Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs\u2014who publicly refuted his lies about election fraud. Taylor, author of the \u201cAnonymous\u201d op-ed and book criticizing Trump, is accused of \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cleaking\u201d classified info. Krebs, who led election cybersecurity and debunked fraud claims, is accused of \u201cweaponizing\u201d his position. Both had their security clearances revoked.Why It Matters: This is what happens in Russia. Trump is using the Justice Department to punish dissenters and settle political scores\u2014targeting public servants who told the truth. This isn\u2019t accountability\u2014it\u2019s retribution. The chilling effect on future whistleblowers and government employees is profound and dangerous.Source: The GuardianUS intelligence investigating whether FBI involved in 2021 Capitol riotWhat Happened: Joseph Kent, chief of staff to DNI Tulsi Gabbard, told lawmakers the intelligence community is investigating whether the FBI planned the January 6 Capitol attack\u2014despite a Justice Department watchdog report already debunking that conspiracy theory.Why It Matters: This is a lie Trump and his cronies continue to promote. It\u2019s part of a broader campaign to rewrite history, shift blame from violent insurrectionists, and weaponize intelligence agencies for political revenge.Source: ReutersDOJ Bars Attorneys from Participating in ABA EventsWhat Happened: The Justice Department, under Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, has banned its lawyers from attending or speaking at American Bar Association events, accusing the organization of promoting \u201cactivist causes\u201d and opposing Trump\u2019s policies in court.Why It Matters: This is a continued direct attack on the independence of the legal profession. Barring DOJ attorneys from the ABA\u2014long a cornerstone of legal standards and accreditation\u2014reiterates Trump\u2019s agenda of politicizing the justice system and law.Source: ReutersDOJ Says Some Pardoned Jan. 6 Defendants Deserve Reimbursement for Capitol Repair FinesWhat Happened: The Justice Department told a federal judge it agrees that certain Jan. 6 rioters\u2014pardoned by Trump\u2014should be reimbursed for restitution paid for Capitol damage. The case involves Stacy Hager of Texas, who wants his $500 back after Trump\u2019s sweeping clemency erased his conviction.Why It Matters: This is sickening. The government is now considering paying reparations to people who attacked the Capitol. Trump not only pardoned them\u2014he wants taxpayers to foot the bill for their crimes. It\u2019s a grotesque reward for domestic terrorism and the attempted overthrowing of an election.Source: USA TodayHouse Votes to Limit Judges After Trump Allies Push Back on Court DecisionsWhat Happened: The Republican-led House passed the \"No Rogue Rulings Act,\" aiming to block district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions\u2014tools that have stopped some of Trump\u2019s most aggressive policies. The vote passed 219-213, with only one Republican opposing. Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader assault on judicial independence\u2014punishing or sidelining judges who check his power. It\u2019s a direct response to courts blocking mass deportations, federal firings, and constitutional overreach. With Congress captured, the judiciary remains the last meaningful check.Source: NBC NewsKari Lake to Be Detailed to State Department to Dismantle VOA Parent AgencyWhat Happened: Kari Lake is being detailed to the State Department to lead the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for Global Media \u2014the parent agency of Voice of America. Though Trump initially planned to appoint Lake as VOA director, those plans were abandoned following legal roadblocks to shuttering the agency.Why It Matters: Lake\u2019s reassignment highlights the continued push to gut U.S.-funded international news outlets. This will neuter America\u2019s global soft power and abandon efforts to support press freedom and democracy abroad. About 3,500 journalists would be affected, as Trump seeks to realign U.S. messaging with his authoritarian agenda.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUS Intensifies Crackdown on Peaceful Protest Under TrumpWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return, 41 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 22 states\u2014over 75% of 2024\u2019s total in just three months. Proposals include 20-year felonies for disrupting pipelines, financial aid bans for student protesters, broad mask bans, rising civil penalties, and increased deportations and surveillance.Why It Matters: Legal experts and civil rights groups warn that Trump and Republican statehouses are weaponizing legislation to criminalize dissent. Inspired by far-right blueprints like Project Esther and ALEC model laws, these measures represent an authoritarian crackdown on First Amendment freedoms\u2014labeling protesters as \u201cterrorists,\u201d expanding deportations, and attempting to chill speech and opposition. In Russia, some people who even mildly oppose the Putin regime are  charged with \u201cterrorism.\u201dSource: The GuardianTrump to Monitor Immigrants\u2019 Social Media for AntisemitismWhat Happened: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it will screen immigrants\u2019 social media for antisemitic content and deny benefits to those deemed \u201cterrorist sympathizers.\u201d The rule targets green card applicants, international students, and people linked to institutions accused of antisemitic activity.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t about fighting hate\u2014it\u2019s about silencing dissent. Civil rights and Jewish advocacy groups warn it's a smokescreen for a broader anti-immigrant crackdown, using Jews as cover to advance an authoritarian agenda. Personally, I think the real aim is to condition surveillance and criminalization of political speech\u2014and eventually expand it to anyone who opposes the regime.Source: The GuardianInside the DHS Task Force Scouring Foreign Students\u2019 Social MediaWhat Happened: A newly created DHS task force is using advanced data tools to scan the social media activity of all 1.5 million international students in the U.S., with an explicit focus on what it labels antisemitic content. This includes potential political speech opposing the war in Gaza. Nearly 300 students have already had their visas revoked. Critics, including CAIR, warn the program resembles McCarthy-era surveillance tactics.Why It Matters: The Biden-era tools once used to flag violence are now being repurposed under Trump to target political dissent. Legal and advocacy groups say the policy tramples on First Amendment rights and is a backdoor way to deport foreign students for expressing unpopular political views. If left unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent that mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia\u2014where dissent is equated with extremism, and criticism of the government leads to surveillance, imprisonment, or exile.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsIce director wants to run deportations like \u2018Amazon Prime for human beings\u2019What Happened: Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said he wants to run deportations like \u201cAmazon Prime for human beings,\u201d describing plans for a business-style model using AI, bed quotas, and private contractors to round up and remove immigrants. At the Border Security Expo, Lyons and other Trump officials praised the use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify mass deportations, with Musk\u2019s operatives reportedly involved in targeting via Social Security data.Why It Matters: This is dystopian and reprehensible. The Trump regime is openly treating immigrants as cargo\u2014outsourcing human removal like logistics work. The fusion of tech, profit, and cruelty reveals the machinery behind mass deportation \u2014 dehumanization at an industrial scale.Source: The GuardianTrump Refuses to Retrieve Wrongly Deported Maryland Man from Salvadoran PrisonWhat Happened: Despite admitting it deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia in violation of a judge\u2019s order, Trump is fighting a court mandate to bring him back\u2014arguing courts lack the power to compel a return after removal, even if unlawful.Why It Matters: If the Supreme Court sides with Trump, it will open the door for the government to disappear anyone\u2014citizen or not\u2014into foreign prisons without legal recourse. This is authoritarian territory.Source: Mother JonesUniversity of Florida Student Deported to Colombia Following Traffic StopWhat Happened: Felipe Zapata Vel\u00e1zquez, a 27-year-old Colombian student on a valid F-1 visa, was deported after a routine traffic stop in Gainesville, Florida. Despite being in good academic standing at UF, ICE detained and removed him following minor infractions like an expired license tag and a suspended license.Why It Matters: His case has sparked outrage from students, lawmakers, and immigrant rights advocates who say Trump\u2019s deportation regime has turned routine stops into mass deportation traps. It\u2019s stoking fear across campuses. A campus protest is planned to demand justice.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchWhite House ends funding for key US climate body: \u2018No coming back from this\u2019What Happened: Trump has ended NASA\u2019s contract with ICF International, effectively shutting down the U.S. Global Change Research Program \u2014the federal body responsible for producing the nation\u2019s top climate science report. The Sixth National Climate Assessment, due in 2027, is now in jeopardy.Why It Matters: This is death to U.S. climate science. By dismantling the federal hub coordinating climate research across 15 agencies, the regime is blinding policymakers, defense officials, and the public just as global temperatures and disasters soar. Source: The GuardianUS Measles Battle Hindered by Confusion Over Health Secretary ResponseWhat Happened: Amid the largest measles outbreak in decades, pediatricians and disease experts say RFK Jr. is undercutting efforts by promoting conspiracies and unproven treatments while failing to consistently advocate for vaccination.Why It Matters: Experts warn Kennedy\u2019s mixed messaging is confusing parents and worsening a preventable public health crisis, as U.S. vaccination rates drop below herd immunity thresholds.Source: ReutersTrump Plans to Remove All Members of HIV Advisory CouncilWhat Happened: Trump is removing all members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) with no timeline for replacements. The purge follows mass layoffs in HIV/AIDS programs at HHS and the CDC.Why It Matters: This unprecedented purge of HIV policy leaders, coupled with deep federal cuts, has pushed the U.S. response into \u201ccrisis mode.\u201d Experts warn it severely undermines efforts to curb infections and track the epidemic, risking a major setback in the fight against a virus still impacting over 1.2 million Americans.Source: ReutersTrump Guts Bird Flu Monitoring Workforce at USDAWhat Happened: 3 key employees in the USDA\u2019s National Animal Health Laboratory Network responsible for bird flu testing and lab coordination are leaving at the end of April. These cuts come amid the worst avian flu outbreak in U.S. history.Why It Matters: The loss of experienced staff will disrupt bird flu testing and monitoring, even as the virus spreads among humans and livestock. Experts warn this weakens public health defenses and compromises the USDA\u2019s ability to contain future outbreaks.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Is on a Quest to Poison Global Political CultureWhat Happened: In a blistering opinion piece, Politico Europe details how Trump\u2019s second term is actively exporting authoritarianism, undermining judicial institutions, and legitimizing far-right actors abroad \u2014 from France to Romania. Trump praised Marine Le Pen after her ban from public office, framing her conviction as politically motivated. Musk is similarly attacking European democratic institutions while promoting far-right movements.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s strategy\u2014amplified by Musk\u2019s platforms\u2014aims to normalize authoritarianism across the West, posing a direct threat to democratic norms and global stability. As Europe increasingly distances itself, it faces a defining choice to recommit to its founding ideals or enable the spread of transatlantic extremism.Source: Politico EuropeFar-right Influencer Laura Loomer Pitching Opposition Research Firm to White HouseWhat Happened: Far-right conspiracy theorist and extremist Laura Loomer is seeking a contract with Trump for her new opposition research firm, Loomered Strategies. After meeting with Trump at the White House and claiming credit for the firing of several National Security Council officials she labeled disloyal, Loomer is now pitching her firm to vet personnel across government agencies.Why It Matters: Loomer's growing influence within the Trump White House highlights the dangerous normalization of fringe ideologues in government operations. Her efforts to purge officials seen as insufficiently loyal to Trump mirror authoritarian-style loyalty tests.Source: The Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsIn a Storm of Tariffs, Many Companies See China as the Safest HarborWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on China and other Asian nations are driving U.S. companies to stay in China, not leave. Businesses cite uncertainty, rising costs elsewhere, and China's manufacturing expertise.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade war is backfiring\u2014deepening U.S. reliance on China instead of reducing it. The chaotic tariff policy is pushing companies away from diversification and into Beijing\u2019s arms.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s tariff retreat leaves lasting US scarsWhat Happened: Trump abruptly paused his sweeping new tariffs for 90 days after a week of global backlash, economic turmoil, and diplomatic pressure. The 10% baseline tariff on all imports remains, while tariffs on China were increased to 124%. No concessions were extracted from other nations.Why It Matters: The retreat exposed the instability of Trump\u2019s trade policy. While markets rallied, the damage to global trust and U.S. credibility remains. Cabinet officials lost face defending a chaotic rollout, and trading partners now see the White House as erratic and vulnerable to pressure.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News4/19- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501Democrat Sues Trump Over Illegal EEOC FiringWhat Happened: Jocelyn Samuels, a Democratic member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, filed a lawsuit after being fired by Trump before her term ended\u2014an unprecedented move that crippled the agency's quorum and halted much of its work.Source: USA TodayProtest Planned After Colombian Student Deported Over Traffic StopWhat Happened: Felipe Zapata Vel\u00e1zquez, a University of Florida student, was deported to Colombia after being arrested during a routine traffic stop for expired documents. ICE detained and deported him despite his valid F-1 visa status and ongoing renewal process. Protests are planned in Florida to push back.Source: The GuardianJudges take steps to block removals of 5 Venezuelans held in Texas and New YorkWhat Happened: Federal judges in Texas and New York halted the deportation of five Venezuelan men accused of gang affiliation under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. Civil liberties groups say the accusations rely on vague and unreliable profiling methods like tattoos and clothing.Source: The GuardianSocial Security Abandons DOGE-Led Phone Service Cuts Amid Chaos, BacklashWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration has scrapped plans pushed by Musk to eliminate many telephone-based services for retirees, disabled people, and Medicare recipients. The plan caused mass confusion, long wait times, website crashes, and panic among vulnerable beneficiaries.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Power Grab in Plain Sight \u2014 Trump is consolidating power by weaponizing the DOJ, purging civil servants, and installing loyalists. Judicial independence, media freedom, and nonpartisan governance are under siege.Criminalizing Dissent \u2014 From mass visa revocations to anti-protest legislation, the Trump regime is turning peaceful opposition into a punishable offense. Critics are being labeled enemies\u2014 accused of \u201ctreason,\u201d immigrants are targeted, and students are deported.Downfall of the DOJ \u2014 Once a pillar of impartial justice, the DOJ is now a tool of political retribution. Under Trump, it\u2019s blacklisting law firms, targeting critics, banning legal forums, and punishing dissent\u2014turning justice into an instrument of authoritarian power.The Resistance Is Growing \u2014 Protests are spreading, lawsuits are mounting, and whistleblowers are speaking out. Despite the crackdown, Americans are refusing to normalize authoritarianism.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Despite Musk\u2019s lies that unauthorized FAKE DOGE would cost taxpayers nothing, the deal outlines an 18-month contract and unprecedented access to agency infrastructure.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> This contradicts promises of cost-free \u201cefficiency\u201d and shows Musk's purpose in embedding operatives across agencies under the guise of modernization while wielding access and influence beyond legal or ethical norms. This is not reform. It\u2019s infiltration.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/department-of-labor-doge-usds-payment/\" rel=\"\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Trump\u2019s \u2018buy\u2019 tip on social media before his tariffs pause made money for investors who listened<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trumps-buy-tip-on-social-media-before-his-tariffs-pause-made-money-for-investors-who-listened\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/160987192/trumps-buy-tip-on-social-media-before-his-tariffs-pause-made-money-for-investors-who-listened\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Hours before announcing a 90-day tariff pause that sent markets soaring, Trump posted \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\u201d on Truth Social.

Legal and advocacy groups say the policy tramples on First Amendment rights and is a backdoor way to deport foreign students for expressing unpopular political views.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 9</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his

Despite Musk\\u2019s lies that unauthorized FAKE DOGE would cost taxpayers nothing, the deal outlines an 18-month contract and unprecedented access to agency infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This contradicts promises of cost-free \\u201Cefficiency\\u201D and shows Musk's purpose in embedding operatives across agencies under the guise of modernization while wielding access and influence beyond legal or ethical norms. This is not reform. It\\u2019s infiltration.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/department-of-labor-doge-usds-payment/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s \\u2018buy\\u2019 tip on social media before his tariffs pause made money for investors who listened</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Hours before announcing a 90-day tariff pause that sent markets soaring, Trump posted \\u201CTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\\u201D on Truth Social. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 9.5%, with Trump Media stock skyrocketing 22.7%, netting Trump\\u2014via his 53% stake\\u2014over $400 million in a day.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This suggests that Trump used insider knowledge to manipulate markets and enrich himself and his allies. Ethics experts are calling it market manipulation in plain sight. This is the kind of authoritarian power play you\\u2019d expect in a kleptocracy, not a democracy.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/politics\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Gabbard\\u2019s Counterterror Pick Tied to Far-Right Paramilitary Group</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Joe Kent, Tulsi Gabbard\\u2019s choice to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, has a long record of extremist ties\\u2014including support for 1st Amendment Praetorian, a paramilitary group linked to January 6 actors. Kent also has a history of promoting conspiracy theories and associating with white nationalists and QAnon-aligned figures.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Another extremist in a top position showing Trump\\u2019s normalization of violent far-right extremist ideology inside national security.

The order strips the firm of security clearances, federal access, and the ability to represent clients in government matters.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a blatant act of retaliation against lawyers who held Trump sycophants accountable for spreading dangerous 2020 election lies.

Taylor, author of the \\u201CAnonymous\\u201D op-ed and book criticizing Trump, is accused of \\u201Ctreason\\u201D and \\u201Cleaking\\u201D classified info. Krebs, who led election cybersecurity and debunked fraud claims, is accused of \\u201Cweaponizing\\u201D his position. Both had their security clearances revoked.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is what happens in Russia. Trump is using the Justice Department to punish dissenters and settle political scores\\u2014targeting public servants who told the truth. This isn\\u2019t accountability\\u2014it\\u2019s retribution.

The case involves Stacy Hager of Texas, who wants his $500 back after Trump\\u2019s sweeping clemency erased his conviction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is sickening. The government is now considering paying reparations to people who attacked the Capitol. Trump not only pardoned them\\u2014he wants taxpayers to foot the bill for their crimes. It\\u2019s a grotesque reward for domestic terrorism and the attempted overthrowing of an election.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/09/january-6-defendants-reimbursed-capitol-fines/83008661007/?tbref=hp\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>House Votes to Limit Judges After Trump Allies Push Back on Court Decisions</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Republican-led House passed the \\\\\\\"No Rogue Rulings Act,\\\\\\\" aiming to block district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions\\u2014tools that have stopped some of Trump\\u2019s most aggressive policies. The vote passed 219-213, with only one Republican opposing. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of Trump\\u2019s broader assault on judicial independence\\u2014punishing or sidelining judges who check his power. It\\u2019s a direct response to courts blocking mass deportations, federal firings, and constitutional overreach.

Though Trump initially planned to appoint Lake as VOA director, those plans were abandoned following legal roadblocks to shuttering the agency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Lake\\u2019s reassignment highlights the continued push to gut U.S.-funded international news outlets. This will neuter America\\u2019s global soft power and abandon efforts to support press freedom and democracy abroad. About 3,500 journalists would be affected, as Trump seeks to realign U.S. messaging with his authoritarian agenda.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/kari-lake-voa-doge/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>US Intensifies Crackdown on Peaceful Protest Under Trump</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Since Trump\\u2019s return, 41 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 22 states\\u2014over 75% of 2024\\u2019s total in just three months. Proposals include 20-year felonies for disrupting pipelines, financial aid bans for student protesters, broad mask bans, rising civil penalties, and increased deportations and surveillance.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Legal experts and civil rights groups warn that Trump and Republican statehouses are weaponizing legislation to criminalize dissent. Inspired by far-right blueprints like Project Esther and ALEC model laws, these measures represent an authoritarian crackdown on First Amendment freedoms\\u2014labeling protesters as \\u201Cterrorists,\\u201D expanding deportations, and attempting to chill speech and opposition.

Civil rights and Jewish advocacy groups warn it's a smokescreen for a broader anti-immigrant crackdown, using Jews as cover to advance an authoritarian agenda.

This includes potential political speech opposing the war in Gaza. Nearly 300 students have already had their visas revoked. Critics, including CAIR, warn the program resembles McCarthy-era surveillance tactics.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Biden-era tools once used to flag violence are now being repurposed under Trump to target political dissent. Legal and advocacy groups say the policy tramples on First Amendment rights and is a backdoor way to deport foreign students for expressing unpopular political views. If left unchecked, it sets a dangerous precedent that mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia\\u2014where dissent is equated with extremism, and criticism of the government leads to surveillance, imprisonment, or exile.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/dhs-task-force-scouring-foreign-students-social-media-rcna198532\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Ice director wants to run deportations like \\u2018Amazon Prime for human beings\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said he wants to run deportations like \\u201CAmazon Prime for human beings,\\u201D describing plans for a business-style model using AI, bed quotas, and private contractors to round up and remove immigrants. At the Border Security Expo, Lyons and other Trump officials praised the use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify mass deportations, with Musk\\u2019s operatives reportedly involved in targeting via Social Security data.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is dystopian and reprehensible. The Trump regime is openly treating immigrants as cargo\\u2014outsourcing human removal like logistics work.

Trump praised Marine Le Pen after her ban from public office, framing her conviction as politically motivated.
