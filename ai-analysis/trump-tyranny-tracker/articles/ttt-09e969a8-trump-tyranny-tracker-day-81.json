Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers have called his deportation \u201ca Kafka-esque mistake.\u201dCredit...Rod Lamkey Jr. for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 10Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump\u2019s \u201cGreat Time to Buy\u201d Post Sparks Insider Trading Allegations After Tariff U-TurnWhat Happened: After markets plunged from Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement, he abruptly reversed course on April 9, pausing most tariffs for 90 days. Just hours before the reversal, Trump posted on Truth Social: \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\u201d and signed it \u201cDJT\u201d\u2014also the ticker for Trump Media. Trump Media stock jumped 20% after the post, and Tesla rose 18%.Why It Matters: Lawmakers like Adam Schiff and AOC are demanding investigations into possible insider trading after Trump\u2019s market-moving tariff reversal. Schiff has called for a review of Trump team communications with financial firms. Legal experts say there\u2019s enough for an SEC probe.Source: TIMETrump Signs Bill Reversing IRS Rule on DeFi Crypto ReportingWhat Happened: Trump signed a bill nullifying an IRS rule that expanded the definition of crypto brokers to include decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges.Why It Matters: This is blatant corruption and a rollback a major win for the crypto industry. It also highlights Trump\u2019s deepening ties to crypto\u2014an industry he, his allies, and his family are profiting from.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s EPA Plans to Stop Collecting Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data From Most PollutersWhat Happened: Trump is gutting the EPA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, slashing reporting requirements from 8,000 facilities down to just 2,300 in select parts of the oil and gas sector. The move was ordered by Trump appointees Abigale Tardif and Aaron Szabo\u2014both former fossil fuel lobbyists.Why It Matters: The program tracks up to 90% of U.S. emissions and is essential for climate accountability at home and abroad. Gutting it cripples domestic policy, lets polluters like China and India off the hook\u2014and marks a win for fossil fuel interests and their allies.Source: ProPublicaTulsi Gabbard Voted in Hawaii After Declaring Texas ResidencyWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard declared under oath that she was a Texas resident in 2023\u2014then voted in Hawaii in the 2024 general election, raising legal and ethical questions.Why It Matters: Gabbard\u2019s actions may violate Hawaii\u2019s election laws and Texas tax rules, which restrict voting and homestead exemptions to primary residences. As a senior official who rails against voter fraud, her dual-residency claims reek of hypocrisy.Source: CNN\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMusk\u2019s DOGE Accused of Spying on Federal Workers with AIWhat Happened: Federal employees say Musk\u2019s operatives are secretly recording meetings, scanning messages with AI, and flagging dissent. Staff across agencies report fear and paranoia.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s purge of the civil service now includes surveillance and AI-driven loyalty tests\u2014tactics that echo authoritarian regimes like Russia. The goal is to silence dissent, instill fear, and consolidate control.Source: The GuardianTrump Escalates Use of Presidential Power to Target Former OfficialsWhat Happened: Trump signed orders directing federal investigations into ex-officials Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, accusing them of potential criminal activity under the Espionage Act and treason. He also ordered scrutiny of the law firm Susman Godfrey, which litigated against Trump-aligned media.Why It Matters: The orders mark an alarming escalation in Trump\u2019s use of state power\u2014formalizing retaliation against perceived \u201cenemies.\u201dSource: New York TimesLabor Leaders Fear Elon Musk and DOGE Could Gain Access to Whistleblower FilesWhat Happened: The AFL-CIO and former OSHA officials warn that Musk\u2019s operatives are embedded at the Department of Labor, and may gain access to sensitive whistleblower files. Musk's companies\u2014Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company\u2014have over 50 active OSHA investigations for workplace injuries and safety violations.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s operatives inside federal agencies pose a dangerous conflict of interest\u2014especially as whistleblowers from Musk-linked and Trump-aligned companies seek protection. Their confidential files could be weaponized to punish them, turning oversight into retaliation.Source: WIREDDOJ Purge: Trump Loyalists Replace Career Lawyers to Defend Radical AgendaWhat Happened: The Justice Department is firing veteran attorneys and replacing them with Trump loyalists to defend some of the regime\u2019s most controversial actions in court\u2014on immigration, executive power, and political retaliation. Dozens of inexperienced or ideologically aligned hires are appearing before judges, while career staff who resist or question directives are suspended or forced out.Why It Matters: Replacing independent civil servants with loyalists guts the department\u2019s credibility, erodes the rule of law, and dismantles internal checks that once shielded justice from political abuse.Source: Washington PostLatham & Watkins, Simpson Thacher Near Deals With White HouseWhat Happened: Four top law firms \u2014 Latham & Watkins, Simpson Thacher, Kirkland & Ellis, and A&O Shearman \u2014 are in talks with the Trump White House to deliver $500 million in pro bono work. In return, they avoid sanctions aimed at firms with \u201cDEI\u201d programs or ties to Trump\u2019s opponents.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing executive power to punish dissent and force ideological loyalty from private firms. Some are caving to protect their profits. Others, like Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block, are suing to stop what they call illegal retaliation. This is an authoritarian assault on the rule of law\u2014one that paves the way for escalating attacks on political opponents, who may soon be left without legal representation.Source: Wall Street JournalFired US Federal Trade Commissioners Concerned About DOGE Data AccessWhat Happened: Recently fired FTC Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya are sounding the alarm over Musk\u2019s operatives gaining potential access to confidential merger files and nonpublic business data. Why It Matters: FTC files contain sensitive corporate data that will be exploited to manipulate markets or benefit Musk\u2019s companies. Musk operatives can access information on pending investigations and rivals, creating grave conflicts of interest and national security risks.Source: ReutersTrump is dismantling election security networks. State officials are alarmedWhat Happened: Trump has gutted federal election security infrastructure\u2014firing CISA staff, disbanding FBI election threat task forces, and cutting funding for a national information-sharing network that helped protect elections from cyberattacks and foreign interference.Why It Matters: State and local officials say these cuts leave elections dangerously exposed to hacking, disinformation, and threats\u2014just as foreign adversaries escalate efforts to disrupt U.S. democracy. Source: CNN\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsAlina Habba Announces Investigation Into Democratic Governor: \u2018I Want It To Be a Warning for Everybody\u2019What Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former Trump lawyer, announced on Fox News that she is launching investigations into New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin. The probe targets their refusal to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, citing obstruction and concealment.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing the Justice Department to target political opponents. This is classic authoritarian behavior\u2014turning prosecution into a blunt tool of political retribution.Source: MediaiteTrump Plans to Withhold All Federal Funding From Sanctuary CitiesWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to cut all federal funding to cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, commonly referred to as \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d In a social media post, Trump called such jurisdictions \u201cdeath traps\u201d that \u201cprotect the criminals, not the victims.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a sweeping abuse of federal power\u2014threatening to cut funds unless states comply with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda. Legal experts warn it sets a dangerous precedent of federal overreach and undermines state and local autonomy.Source: Wall Street JournalU.S. Cyber Defenders Shaken by Trump\u2019s Attack on Their Former BossWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to investigate Chris Krebs, the former CISA chief who rejected Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies. He also revoked Krebs\u2019 security clearance, accusing him of \u201cweaponizing\u201d his position for defending the integrity of the vote. Trump also ordered an investigation into former DHS official Miles Taylor, who publicly criticized him.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating efforts to punish officials who told the truth\u2014starting with Chris Krebs, who simply worked to protect U.S. elections. Morale at CISA has collapsed. Meanwhile, as threats from China and ransomware gangs grow, Trump is gutting the very agency meant to defend America\u2019s infrastructure.Source: NBC NewsUS government has revoked more than 600 student visas, data showsWhat Happened: Over 600 international students have had their visas revoked or immigration status changed by the Trump regime, with many linked to Gaza protests or minor infractions.Why It Matters: The AI-powered \u201cCatch and Revoke\u201d program is targeting dissent, expanding surveillance, and punishing student activists\u2014posing a serious threat to civil liberties.Source: The GuardianFDIC Brings in Elon Musk\u2019s Staff What Happened: The FDIC has begun working with Musk\u2019s operatives, focusing on reviewing agency contracts and staffing.Why It Matters: Trump is expanding Musk\u2019s reach into financial regulation while gutting the federal workforce \u2014raising fears of chaos and disruption at a key banking watchdog. Musk and his unvetted operatives have no business inside critical agencies with access to sensitive financial data.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia UniversityWhat Happened: Trump is pushing for Columbia University to enter into a consent decree\u2014a legally binding agreement enforced by a federal judge\u2014to compel changes in how the university handles antisemitism. The move comes after Trump cut $400 million in federal grants and contracts and is extorting terms for reinstating that funding.Why It Matters: A consent decree would give the federal government sweeping, court-enforceable power over Columbia\u2019s internal policies\u2014setting a dangerous precedent for authoritarian-style control over universities. It\u2019s a crackdown on protest, dissent, and academic freedom under the guise of civil rights enforcement.Source: Wall Street JournalICE Pledges to Stop Illegal \u2018Ideas\u2019 From Entering U.S. \u2014 Then Deletes the PostWhat Happened: ICE posted \u2014 then deleted \u2014 a message pledging to stop \u201cideas\u201d from crossing the U.S. border illegally, sparking backlash. The agency later claimed it meant \u201cintellectual property,\u201d but critics say it reflects Trump\u2019s widening crackdown on political dissent.Why It Matters: This slip reveals the authoritarian mindset behind current immigration enforcement\u2014where ideology and disagreement with the regime are grounds for expulsion. This is part of a broader campaign to silence free speech and punish dissent.Source: Rolling Stone\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsHouse Republicans Passed a Voter Suppression Bill That Would Disenfranchise MillionsWhat Happened: The GOP-led House passed the SAVE Act, which would require in-person documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote\u2014potentially disenfranchising tens of millions, especially women, rural voters, and people without easy access to documents.Why It Matters: Civil rights groups warn it\u2019s the most aggressive federal voter suppression bill in modern history. It\u2019s a MAGA-backed attempt to weaponize lies of noncitizen voting to block lawful Americans from the ballot box.Source: Mother JonesPressed for Evidence Against Mahmoud Khalil, Government Cites Its Power to Deport People for BeliefsWhat Happened: Instead of presenting criminal evidence, Trump submitted a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserting it could deport Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil\u2014a legal U.S. resident\u2014based on his political beliefs and perceived foreign policy impact.Why It Matters: This case exemplifies Trump\u2019s authoritarian crackdown on dissent, where lawful speech and protest are reframed as national security threats. Legal experts warn it sets a chilling precedent for deporting individuals solely for their political views. Source: Associated PressSocial Security Lists Thousands of Living Immigrants as Dead to Force Them OutWhat Happened: Trump has reclassified over 6,000 living immigrants as deceased, canceling their Social Security numbers in an effort to cut off access to work, banking, and basic services\u2014effectively coercing them to \u201cself-deport.\u201d The move targets immigrants admitted under Biden-era programs, including those who entered using the CBP One app.Why It Matters: This Orwellian tactic weaponizes federal databases to erase immigrants from legal existence. Experts warn it violates due process, with civil rights groups preparing lawsuits. Source: Associated PressStates Advance Fetal Rights Measures That Critics Warn Could Lay Groundwork for National Abortion BanWhat Happened: Kansas Republicans overrode the governor\u2019s veto to enact a law granting fetuses child support and tax deduction rights from conception. Florida lawmakers are advancing a bill allowing parents to sue for the wrongful death of a fetus at any stage of pregnancy. Why It Matters: Legal experts warn this is part of a broader plan to enshrine fetal rights and ban abortion nationwide. Critics say these laws threaten IVF, criminalize miscarriage, and could drive doctors out of states like Florida. It\u2019s an attack on women\u2019s rights that will soon expand.Source: Associated PressFBI, Other Criminal Investigators Drafted for Welfare Checks on Migrant ChildrenWhat Happened: Trump deployed FBI agents and other federal law enforcement to conduct \u201cwelfare checks\u201d on migrant children who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied\u2014raising alarm among immigration advocates. The operation involves questioning children and their sponsors about smuggling, employment, and legal status, with instructions to notify ICE if children are deemed \u201cin danger.\u201dWhy It Matters: Critics warn these \u201cwelfare checks\u201d are a cover for deportation raids. Armed agents showing up unannounced retraumatize vulnerable kids and families. It\u2019s a reprehensible extension of Trump\u2019s family separation playbook\u2014and part of his push to erase humanitarian protections.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchInside Elon Musk\u2019s Gleeful Destruction of the GovernmentWhat Happened: Musk has purged tens of thousands of federal workers, slashed aid, and taken control of government systems\u2014all while enriching himself and mocking the chaos. Courts and whistleblowers are sounding alarms over constitutional violations, mass data access, and conflict-ridden contracts.Why It Matters: Musk, unelected and unconfirmed, is acting as a shadow head of government\u2014weaponizing federal agencies, silencing dissent, and turning the executive branch into a tool of profit and power. This is governance by oligarchy.Source: Rolling StoneGSA Tech Arm Faces More CutsWhat Happened: The General Services Administration is implementing another wave of purges in its tech divisions, targeting staff at Technology Transformation Services, including the Integrated Award Environment and the Office of Regulatory and Oversight Systems. Key programs like FedRAMP and Login.gov are spared, but others risk severe disruption.Why It Matters: Gutting IAE risks breaking the backbone of federal contracting. Experts warn Trump\u2019s cuts will crash critical digital infrastructure\u2014crippling how the government buys, tracks, and manages billions in contracts.Source: FedScoopMore than 2,600 US Energy Dept Staffers Accept Second Offer to Resign, Sources SayWhat Happened: Over 2,600 employees at the U.S. Department of Energy have accepted a second round of resignation offers\u2014more than double the number from January. Offices critical to power grid maintenance, clean energy deployment, and advanced tech loan programs are impacted.Why It Matters: Mass resignations gut U.S. energy expertise\u2014undermining power grid stability, clean tech, and national security. Source: ReutersTrump Cuts Contracts for National Climate AssessmentWhat Happened: Trump has slashed contracts supporting the National Climate Assessment and other climate science work. NASA terminated agreements with contractor ICF, which had been helping produce the congressionally mandated report that outlines the impacts of climate change across the U.S.Why It Matters: This guts the country\u2019s ability to track and respond to climate change, just as extreme weather worsens. Trump\u2019s denial of climate science is being institutionalized\u2014defunding research and sidelining the U.S. from global climate action.Source: The HillCDC Lays Off Cruise Ship Health Inspectors Amid Norovirus SurgeWhat Happened: All full-time CDC employees in the Vessel Sanitation Program were laid off, leaving only 12 Public Health Service officers to manage cruise ship inspections and outbreak responses.Why It Matters: The layoffs hit during a record year for norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships and will severely hinder the CDC\u2019s ability to ensure onboard health and safety, despite the program being industry-funded.Source: CBS NewsCDC Cuts Sickle Cell and Disability Programs Amid RestructuringWhat Happened: Nearly half of the CDC's staff working on birth defects and disabilities\u2014including sickle cell research and adult cognitive disability data collection\u2014were fired.Why It Matters: The cuts halt life-saving public health programs and threaten care for vulnerable communities, especially Black Americans with sickle cell disease and adults with developmental disabilities.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump\u2019s Trade War Is Strengthening China\u2019s Soft PowerWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff hikes\u2014now reaching an effective rate of 145% on many Chinese goods\u2014are severely straining both U.S. and Chinese economies. But while China faces rising unemployment and deflation, its global image is improving, with Chinese-made brands and influencers gaining popularity as Trump alienates allies and disrupts supply chains.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade war is backfiring\u2014fueling inflation at home and weakening U.S. alliances abroad, while allowing China to fill the soft power vacuum. Source: WIREDDanish Shoppers Boycott U.S. Products Over Greenland, Trade DisputeWhat Happened: Danish consumers are rejecting American goods in protest of Trump\u2019s push to illegally annex Greenland and his tariffs on EU exports. Supermarkets like F\u00f8tex now label EU-made items to guide buyers.Why It Matters: The boycott reflects deepening resentment in Europe over Trump\u2019s aggressive trade and foreign policies, with ripple effects for U.S. brands like Tesla and McDonald\u2019s across the continent.Source: CNBC\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchUS Ambassador to Ukraine to Step Down as \u201cPeace\u201d Talks StallWhat Happened: Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and a key advocate for military aid, is stepping down after nearly three years in Kyiv. Her departure comes as the Trump pushes for a ceasefire that delivers for Russia.Why It Matters: Brink\u2019s exit highlights the sharp turn in U.S. Ukraine policy\u2014away from backing Kyiv and toward pressuring it into a surrender to Russia. It highlights deepening unease inside the State Department over Trump\u2019s fealty to Putin.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f Supreme Court WatchSupreme Court Tells Government to Seek Return of Man Mistakenly Deported to El Salvador PrisonWhat Happened: The Supreme Court ordered Trump to take steps to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal U.S. resident mistakenly disappeared to a Salvadoran prison in violation of a court order protecting him from repatriation.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged the shortfall, blaming drought, and offered a proposal to resolve the dispute.Why It Matters: The escalation threatens U.S.\u2013Mexico trade and worsens tensions as droughts intensify. Water is now a geopolitical flashpoint\u2014with major consequences for U.S. farmers and diplomacy. Source: New York TimesWhat Just Happened in the US Treasury Market?What Happened: Trump\u2019s tariff threats triggered a sharp selloff in the $29 trillion U.S. Treasury market, sending 10-year yields to their biggest weekly spike in over a decade. The panic eased only after Trump paused the tariffs on Wednesday.Why It Matters: The Treasury market is the backbone of global finance. Surging yields\u2014driven by hedge fund unwinding and fears of erratic policy\u2014pushed up borrowing costs worldwide, roiled mortgage rates, and prompted warnings of a return of the \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d forcing fiscal restraint.Source: ReutersYellen: Trump \u2018Has Taken a Wrecking Ball\u2019 to Economy With Trade WarWhat Happened: Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen slammed Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, saying he \u201cinherited\u201d strong growth and low unemployment, but \u201chas taken a wrecking ball to it\u201d with chaotic trade policies.

Just hours before the reversal, Trump posted on Truth Social: \u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\u201d and signed it \u201cDJT\u201d\u2014also the ticker for Trump Media. Trump Media stock jumped 20% after the post, and Tesla rose 18%.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Lawmakers like Adam Schiff and AOC are demanding investigations into possible insider trading after Trump\u2019s market-moving tariff reversal. Schiff has called for a review of Trump team communications with financial firms.
