Credit...Martin Bernetti/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: September 5Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: ZoomZoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsBill Pulte accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of fraud. His relatives filed housing claims similar to hersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s housing chief Bill Pulte accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of fraud over dual homestead tax exemptions, but records show his own father and stepmother claimed the same in Michigan and Florida. After Reuters inquiries, Michigan revoked the exemption, citing rental use that violates the rules.Why It Matters: The hypocrisy undercuts Trump\u2019s attack on Cook, whose firing and DOJ probe stemmed from Pulte\u2019s claims. With his own family implicated in similar tax maneuvers, the case highlights selective enforcement and political targeting.Source: ReutersFeds scrap proposal to offer cash to airline passengers for flight disruptionsWhat Happened: The Department of Transportation dropped a Biden-era proposal that would have forced airlines to pay passengers cash for delays and cancellations under their control. The rule would have required up to $775 in compensation, but Trump\u2019s DOT shelved it, siding with carriers who argued it was too burdensome.Why It Matters: Trump installed a former airline lobbyist to run the DOT, and this is the result. By scrapping cash compensation rules, his regime is gutting consumer protections and giving airlines free rein to delay and cancel flights without consequence.Source: CBS NewsUnder Trump, the Federal Trade Commission is abandoning its ban on noncompetesWhat Happened: The FTC, led by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson, voted to scrap its nationwide ban on noncompete agreements, a key Biden-era policy. Instead, it will handle disputes case by case, leaving about 30 million workers still bound by restrictive contracts.Why It Matters: The rollback hands power back to corporations and curtails worker mobility, wage growth, and entrepreneurship. Critics warn the FTC\u2019s piecemeal approach is toothless, trapping millions in exploitative jobs while business lobbies celebrate.Source: NPRTrump says next year's G20 summit will be held at his resort near MiamiWhat Happened: Trump announced the 2026 G20 summit will be held at his Trump National Doral resort in Florida, reviving a plan scrapped in 2019 after bipartisan backlash. He claimed his business \u201cwill not make any money,\u201d though ethics experts warn it violates constitutional bans on profiting from foreign governments.Why It Matters: Steering a global summit to his own resort openly merges state power with personal profit. It further normalizes corruption, damages U.S. credibility, and signals to allies and adversaries that diplomacy is a Trump family business.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation News'Unconstitutional' and 'unlawful': Judges push back on Trump's expanding powerWhat Happened: Federal judges blocked Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, struck down his National Guard deployment in Los Angeles, halted a $2 billion Harvard funding freeze, and restored TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans. These rulings came days after an appeals court also ruled some of his tariffs unlawful.Why It Matters: The defeats show growing judicial resistance to Trump\u2019s sweeping power grabs, even as the Supreme Court often sides with him. Courts are increasingly branding his actions \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cunlawful,\u201d while exposing his authoritarian strategy.Source: NBC NewsHow Stephen Miller is running Trump\u2019s effort to take over D.C.What Happened: Stephen Miller is directing Trump\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, D.C., managing arrest reports, deployment plans, and coordination with agencies. He calls the crackdown a \u201cmoral and spiritual war,\u201d as federalized police and ICE now conduct deportation sweeps and aggressive patrols across the city.Why It Matters: Miller\u2019s role shows D.C. is being used as a testing ground for authoritarian policing, eroding home rule, and blurring federal-local lines. With Trump planning to extend control through 2026, residents face prolonged occupation under Miller\u2019s hardline vision.Source: Washington PostChicago gears up as Trump troop deployment looms: \u2018We aren\u2019t helpless\u2019What Happened: Trump is preparing to send federal troops and ICE agents to Chicago, calling it a \u201chellhole\u201d despite declining crime rates. Local leaders rejected the plan, while activists and legal groups launched \u201cknow your rights\u201d campaigns and community organizing to resist.Why It Matters: Chicago will be the next front in Trump\u2019s authoritarian crackdown and occupation, with Black and Latino communities bracing for profiling and unconstitutional policing. The pushback highlights both legal challenges and grassroots resistance to his militarization of U.S. cities.Source: The GuardianMisled by video of 2020 protests shown on Fox, Trump threatens to invade Portland and 'wipe out' protestersWhat Happened: Trump threatened to send the National Guard to Portland after Fox News aired 2020 protest footage as if it were current. He claimed the city was being \u201cdestroyed\u201d and vowed to \u201cwipe out\u201d protesters, though this year\u2019s demonstrations were only small gatherings outside an ICE facility.Why It Matters: This shows Trump\u2019s decisions are being driven by disinformation and media manipulation. Acting on false reports, he is escalating crackdowns on Americans exercising their rights while reviving conspiracy theories about \u201cpaid agitators.\u201dSource: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsSenate Democrats to investigate firings of Justice Dept. employees who worked for special counsel Jack SmithWhat Happened: Senate Democrats launched an investigation into the DOJ\u2019s purge of at least 20 staff tied to special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s Trump probes. Ordered by Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s \u201cweaponization working group,\u201d the purge targeted prosecutors, paralegals, finance staff, and U.S. Marshals.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing the DOJ to punish and erase those who investigated him, carrying out a purge of career staff. By criminalizing public service, he is dismantling independent justice and warning anyone who would hold him accountable.Source: CBS NewsGeorgia Governor Sending 300 National Guard Troops to DC amid Trump\u2019s CrackdownWhat Happened: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he will send over 300 National Guard troops to Washington to back Trump\u2019s federal intervention, adding to more than 2,300 already deployed. The move comes as lawsuits challenge the deployment as an unlawful \u201cmilitary occupation.\u201dWhy It Matters: By sending troops, Kemp is endorsing Trump\u2019s militarization of domestic law enforcement. His support deepens the normalization of a growing police state in the nation\u2019s capital and beyond.Source: Military.comState Department Agents Are Now Working With ICE on ImmigrationWhat Happened: The State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, normally focused on passport fraud and protecting diplomats, is now working with ICE to detain immigrants. Hundreds of DSS officers have been deputized for immigration enforcement, far outside their authority or training.Why It Matters: Conscripting the State Department into deportations erases agency boundaries and normalizes the misuse of federal power. Untrained agents enforcing immigration law heighten civil rights risks while advancing a far-right extremist \u201cremigration\u201d agenda.Source: WIREDWashington, DC, residents press Congress to end Trump's federal law enforcement surgeWhat Happened: Washington, D.C. residents delivered letters to lawmakers demanding an end to Trump\u2019s federal law enforcement surge, calling it an \u201cactive military takeover\u201d and a direct threat to democracy. The protests came as the Army extended the D.C. National Guard\u2019s active duty through Nov. 30, keeping more than 2,300 troops on the streets.Why It Matters: Trump has turned the nation\u2019s capital into a militarized zone, erasing local autonomy and using federal troops as political enforcers. Residents warn the occupation is a textbook sign of democratic backsliding and an authoritarian power grab in real time.Source: ABC NewsHow Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans are reacting to Trump's National Guard threatsWhat Happened: Despite a court ruling that his Los Angeles National Guard deployment was illegal, Trump is threatening to send troops into Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Governors in Illinois and Maryland object, while Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor has welcomed the move.Why It Matters: Trump is testing how far he can use the military for domestic law enforcement. If unchecked, such deployments will normalize military occupation of U.S. cities and erode constitutional limits.Source: NPRResidents of high-crime city in Republican-led Louisiana oppose Trump's troop planWhat Happened: Trump suggested sending National Guard troops into Shreveport, Louisiana, with support from the state\u2019s Republican governor, but opposition from local leaders. The city\u2019s mayor, police chief, and residents warned it would sap resources, hurt community policing, and serve as a political stunt amid falling crime.Why It Matters: Even in GOP-led states, Trump\u2019s militarization push is being dismissed as ineffective and harmful. Locals argue that investment in policing, youth programs, and community support would reduce violence more than troop deployments.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsEric Adams eyed by Trump for Saudi Arabia ambassadorshipWhat Happened: Trump is weighing NYC Mayor Eric Adams for ambassador to Saudi Arabia as Adams struggles in his reelection bid. Adams denies a formal offer but met with Trump\u2019s team, and his exit would aid Andrew Cuomo against frontrunner Zohran Mamdani.Why It Matters: Trump is meddling in NYC politics, using job offers to shape the mayoral field. Adams\u2019 troubles, Cuomo\u2019s comeback, and Mamdani\u2019s rise illustrate how Trump is extending his patronage politics into local races.Source: PoliticoAll the President\u2019s Tech CEOsWhat Happened: Trump hosted a White House dinner with tech CEOs, including Zuckerberg, Gates, Nadella, Cook, Altman, and Pichai, who praised his leadership and pledged major U.S. investments. Missing were Bezos, Musk, and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, while attendees steered clear of tariffs, immigration, and environmental costs.Why It Matters: The deference resembled authoritarian loyalty rituals, with Big Tech aligning to Trump\u2019s power rather than policy debate. Like Putin\u2019s oligarchs, America\u2019s tech elite signal that profit and survival now depend on personal fealty.Source: WiredMystery of former Federal Reserve Governor Kugler\u2019s resignation deepens as real estate records raise new questionsWhat Happened: Former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler\u2019s sudden August resignation remains unexplained, with real estate records adding to the mystery. CNBC found her disclosures list a Bethesda home as her residence, while Maryland tax records say it was not; Kugler blames a county clerical error and denies wrongdoing.Why It Matters: The revelations surface as Trump escalates attacks on Fed officials, including firing Lisa Cook over mortgage claims. This pattern suggests that the White House is weaponizing personal records to pressure regulators, threatening Fed independence and U.S. financial stability\u2014a classic authoritarian tactic to remove opposition.Source: CNBC\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS veterans decry arrest of ex-army sergeant after Ice protestWhat Happened: U.S. Army veteran Bajun Mavalwalla, who helped evacuate Afghans after Kabul\u2019s fall, faces up to 6 years in prison on sham federal conspiracy charges after joining a protest against Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Veterans say his arrest criminalizes peaceful dissent, noting he briefly locked arms with protesters outside an ICE facility.Why It Matters: The prosecution of a decorated veteran and refugee advocate is a chilling escalation\u2014using sham conspiracy charges to intimidate demonstrators and silence opposition. Veterans and rights groups warn this is a dangerous step toward authoritarianism and a test case for broader repression.Source: The GuardianTrump Administration Tightens Asylum Rules for Women Fleeing Domestic AbuseWhat Happened: Pam Bondi reinstated Trump-era restrictions that make it far harder for women fleeing domestic abuse abroad to win asylum in the U.S. The move reverses Biden\u2019s 2021 policy, narrowing eligibility to only the most extraordinary cases.Why It Matters: Thousands of women escaping violence may now be denied refuge, forced back to dangerous conditions. By treating domestic abuse as a \u201cprivate\u201d matter rather than persecution, the regime is shutting the door on one of the most vulnerable groups seeking protection.Source: Wall Street JournalNavy base to serve as hub for up to 250 federal agents for Chicago immigration crackdown, memo indicatesWhat Happened: An internal memo shows DHS is using Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois to house 250 federal agents, 140 vehicles, and supplies for upcoming immigration sweeps in the Chicago area. The base will serve as a command post for ICE and CBP raids expected to last weeks.Why It Matters: Trump is turning U.S. military bases into hubs for immigration raids, erasing the boundary between civilian law enforcement and military power. This unprecedented move escalates his authoritarian crackdown, with immigrants serving as the test case.Source: CBS NewsExam administrator College Board scraps tool for identifying disadvantaged studentsWhat Happened: The College Board will eliminate its \u201cLandscape\u201d tool, which provided admissions officers with data on applicants\u2019 schools and neighborhoods to spot disadvantaged students. The decision follows Trump\u2019s pressure on colleges to dismantle diversity and inclusion practices under threat of losing federal funding.Why It Matters: Scrapping the tool removes a way to identify talent from under-resourced communities, limiting opportunities for marginalized students. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader attack on higher education and civil rights.Source: ReutersAbrego Garcia Now Facing Shifting Threats of DeportationWhat Happened: Trump officials are pursuing multiple avenues to deport Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, despite a court ruling barring his return to El Salvador over safety concerns. After floating Uganda, officials now say they will send him to Eswatini, arguing his asylum bid voids earlier protections.Why It Matters: Abrego Garcia\u2019s case highlights the regime\u2019s willingness to skirt court orders and shift legal grounds to ensure deportation. His lawyers call it retribution and a test case for expanding hardline tactics, raising fears about due process and abuse of immigration law.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDemocrat who called RFK Jr. a 'charlatan' says U.S. is vulnerable to next pandemicWhat Happened: At a Senate hearing, Sen. Maria Cantwell called RFK Jr. a \u201ccharlatan\u201d for cutting hundreds of millions in mRNA research and purging the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel. Lawmakers in both parties said he\u2019s undermining pandemic preparedness.Why It Matters: By gutting vaccine research and empowering anti-vaccine extremists, Kennedy is leaving the U.S. exposed to the next pandemic. Experts warn his policies are driving outbreaks like rising measles cases and dismantling the scientific foundation that protected Americans for generations.Source: NPRWhite House review of biofuel waiver plan pits farmers against refinersWhat Happened: The White House is weighing an EPA plan on whether to reallocate billions of gallons of waived biofuel mandates, potentially reshaping the Renewable Fuel Standard. Farmers want full reallocation to protect crop markets, while refiners warn it would raise compliance costs and fuel prices.Why It Matters: The decision pits agriculture against oil at a time when Trump is prioritizing his fossil fuels donors over climate goals. The ruling will decide whether farmers secure a stable demand for corn and soy or whether the refiners win.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s pick to lead BLS ran Twitter account with sexually degrading, bigoted attacksWhat Happened: Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but CNN found he once ran a Twitter account laced with sexist attacks on Kamala Harris, homophobic slurs, conspiracy theories, and insults at Trump critics. A loyalist with little government experience, Antoni has echoed far-right rhetoric and promoted election and Covid conspiracies.Why It Matters: The nomination hands U.S. labor data to a partisan with a record of bigotry and disinformation, politicizing a key economic agency. Economists warn it will erode credibility and corrupt how jobs and unemployment figures are reported.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchSouth Koreans Are Swept Up in Immigration Raid at Hyundai Plant in GeorgiaWhat Happened: ICE raided a Hyundai battery plant construction site in Georgia, arresting 475 workers\u2014mostly South Korean citizens\u2014in the largest single-site immigration action ever. The raid shut down operations, sparked alarm in Seoul, and even swept up Korean business executives visiting on a business trip. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown collides with his economic agenda, threatening billions in Korean investment vital to U.S. EV and battery production. The mass arrests strain ties with a key ally and undermine U.S. industrial policy and alliances. It also sends a chilling message to global partners and companies\u2014who would invest in America if this is the result?Source: New York TimesVenezuela flies military aircraft near U.S. Navy ship for a second time, Pentagon officials sayWhat Happened: For the second day in a row, Venezuelan F-16s flew within weapons range of the USS Jason Dunham in international waters, Pentagon officials said. Trump warned Venezuela would be \u201cin trouble\u201d if its planes fly dangerously close again, as the U.S. sends F-35s to the region and threatens to continue strikes on alleged \u201ccartel\u201d boats.Why It Matters: With Trump doubling down on military deployments and lethal strikes, U.S.-Venezuela tensions are moving toward open confrontation.Source: CBS NewsWhat to Know About a Rapid U.S. Military Buildup in the CaribbeanWhat Happened: The U.S. has deployed eight warships, surveillance planes, an attack submarine, and 10 F-35s to the Caribbean as tensions with Venezuela escalate. This follows a U.S. strike on a Venezuelan boat that killed 11 people and a Venezuelan fighter jet flyover of a U.S. destroyer.Why It Matters: Trump is framing Venezuela\u2019s government a \u201cnarco-terror cartel\u201d to justify possible military action. Even without formal invasion plans, the buildup risks armed conflict and regional destabilization.Source:  New York TimesTrump sends 10 stealth fighter planes to Puerto Rico amid war on Caribbean drug cartelsWhat Happened: Trump is escalating in the Caribbean, deploying 10 F-35 stealth fighters to Puerto Rico after a U.S. missile strike killed 11 alleged Venezuelans and Venezuelan jets buzzed a U.S. warship. Officials promised more \u201ckinetic strikes\u201d on drug boats as Democrats and some Republicans questioned the operations\u2019 legality.Source: The GuardianHow a Top Secret SEAL Team 6 Mission Into North Korea Fell ApartWhat Happened: In 2019, Trump approved a secret SEAL Team 6 mission to plant a device in North Korea to spy on Kim Jong-un. The mission collapsed when SEALs killed unarmed North Koreans they mistook as threats and aborted without planting the device. Congress was never notified, possibly violating the law.Why It Matters: The failed raid risked sparking conflict with a nuclear power and exposed how Trump bypassed oversight on high-stakes missions, raising concerns about secrecy, civilian deaths, and unchecked executive power.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchForeign troops in Ukraine would be considered 'legitimate targets' to Russia, Putin saysWhat Happened: Putin warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be treated as \u201clegitimate targets,\u201d even under a future ceasefire. His threat came as 26 nations met in Paris with Zelenskyy to pledge land, sea, and air support for Ukraine\u2019s security.Why It Matters: Putin is trying to intimidate Europe while waging a genocidal invasion with tens of thousands of North Korean troops. His escalating threats aim to weaken Western resolve\u2014and Trump\u2019s fealty to Russia only heightens the danger.Source: ABC News123,000 flights disrupted by Russian signals \u2013 threatening flight safetyWhat Happened: A joint report by Sweden and five neighboring countries found nearly 123,000 flights were disrupted by Russian GPS and satellite signal interference this year. The jamming and spoofing, traced to sites in Kaliningrad, St. Petersburg, Smolensk, and Rostov, caused false position data and navigation failures across Baltic and Polish airspace.Why It Matters: This is a direct threat to international aviation safety, with nearly half of flights in some areas affected. Russia has been weaponizing GPS disruption as part of its hybrid war, endangering civilian air travel and testing NATO\u2019s resolve to respond to escalating attacks on critical infrastructure.Source: SVT\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsHiring Stalled in August, With 22,000 New JobsWhat Happened: The U.S. added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below forecasts, with June revised to a net loss of 13,000\u2014the first decline since 2020. Unemployment rose to 4.3%, with Black workers hit hardest.Why It Matters: The slump shows Trump\u2019s tariffs and immigration limits are slowing growth and widening inequality. With job losses mounting and the Fed under attack, the labor market is faltering even as the regime scrambles to rewrite the data.Source: Wall Street JournalEtsy sellers are being hit hard by tariffs and the end of the de minimis ruleWhat Happened: Etsy sellers are being hit by Trump\u2019s sudden end to the de minimis rule, which exempted imports under $800 from tariffs. Small businesses abroad now face tariffs up to 35% and heavy paperwork, threatening livelihoods built on U.S. sales.Why It Matters: The change is gutting microbusinesses that depended on affordable access to American buyers. Consumers are already seeing higher prices and surprise fees, while online retail faces disruption as Trump doubles down on tariffs.Source: NPRTrump\u2019s Tariffs Leave US Business Tied Up in Costly Red TapeWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs are forcing U.S. businesses to exhaustively document the origins of metals and other materials, with small firms spending hours per shipment navigating shifting rules. If origins can\u2019t be proven, tariffs automatically jump to 200%.Why It Matters: Despite promises to cut red tape, Trump\u2019s chaotic tariffs are slowing investment, raising costs, and snarling supply chains. While some manufacturers welcome protection, many businesses say the bureaucracy and policy whiplash are crushing them.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News10/18- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Gov.

Kathy Hochul signed an executive order letting New Yorkers get COVID shots at pharmacies without a prescription, declaring a state \u201cdisaster\u201d over federal limits. The move ensures children, pregnant people, and adults under 65 can access the updated vaccine despite Trump\u2019s restrictions.Source: ABC NewsUS judge blocks Trump from canceling legal status for Venezuelans, HaitiansWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s move to cancel Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling the regime acted illegally and with racial bias.

Prices continue rising, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.

After Reuters inquiries, Michigan revoked the exemption, citing rental use that violates the rules.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> The hypocrisy undercuts Trump\u2019s attack on Cook, whose firing and DOJ probe stemmed from Pulte\u2019s claims. With his own family implicated in similar tax maneuvers, the case highlights selective enforcement and political targeting.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-pulte-accused-fed-governor-lisa-cook-fraud-his-relatives-filed-housing-2025-09-05/\" rel=\"\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Feds scrap proposal to offer cash to airline passengers for flight disruptions<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7feds-scrap-proposal-to-offer-cash-to-airline-passengers-for-flight-disruptions\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/172899063/feds-scrap-proposal-to-offer-cash-to-airline-passengers-for-flight-disruptions\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> The Department of Transportation dropped a Biden-era proposal that would have forced airlines to pay passengers cash for delays and cancellations under their control. The rule would have required up to $775 in compensation, but Trump\u2019s DOT shelved it, siding with carriers who argued it was too burdensome.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Trump installed a former airline lobbyist to run the DOT, and this is the result. By scrapping cash compensation rules, his regime is gutting consumer protections and giving airlines free rein to delay and cancel flights without consequence.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airlines-flight-disruption-transportation-department-cash-refund/\" rel=\"\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Under Trump, the Federal Trade Commission is abandoning its ban on noncompetes<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7under-trump-the-federal-trade-commission-is-abandoning-its-ban-on-noncompetes\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/172899063/under-trump-the-federal-trade-commission-is-abandoning-its-ban-on-noncompetes\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> The FTC, led by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson, voted to scrap its nationwide ban on noncompete agreements, a key Biden-era policy.

His relatives filed housing claims similar to hers</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s housing chief Bill Pulte accused Fed Governor Lisa Cook of fraud over dual homestead tax exemptions, but records show his own father and stepmother claimed the same in Michigan and Florida. After Reuters inquiries, Michigan revoked the exemption, citing rental use that violates the rules.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The hypocrisy undercuts Trump\\u2019s attack on Cook, whose firing and DOJ probe stemmed from Pulte\\u2019s claims. With his own family implicated in similar tax maneuvers, the case highlights selective enforcement and political targeting.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-pulte-accused-fed-governor-lisa-cook-fraud-his-relatives-filed-housing-2025-09-05/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Feds scrap proposal to offer cash to airline passengers for flight disruptions</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Transportation dropped a Biden-era proposal that would have forced airlines to pay passengers cash for delays and cancellations under their control. The rule would have required up to $775 in compensation, but Trump\\u2019s DOT shelved it, siding with carriers who argued it was too burdensome.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump installed a former airline lobbyist to run the DOT, and this is the result. By scrapping cash compensation rules, his regime is gutting consumer protections and giving airlines free rein to delay and cancel flights without consequence.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airlines-flight-disruption-transportation-department-cash-refund/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Under Trump, the Federal Trade Commission is abandoning its ban on noncompetes</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FTC, led by Trump appointee Andrew Ferguson, voted to scrap its nationwide ban on noncompete agreements, a key Biden-era policy. Instead, it will handle disputes case by case, leaving about 30 million workers still bound by restrictive contracts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The rollback hands power back to corporations and curtails worker mobility, wage growth, and entrepreneurship. Critics warn the FTC\\u2019s piecemeal approach is toothless, trapping millions in exploitative jobs while business lobbies celebrate.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5528937/ftc-noncompete-ban-trump\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump says next year's G20 summit will be held at his resort near Miami</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced the 2026 G20 summit will be held at his Trump National Doral resort in Florida, reviving a plan scrapped in 2019 after bipartisan backlash. He claimed his business \\u201Cwill not make any money,\\u201D though ethics experts warn it violates constitutional bans on profiting from foreign governments.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Steering a global summit to his own resort openly merges state power with personal profit. It further normalizes corruption, damages U.S. credibility, and signals to allies and adversaries that diplomacy is a Trump family business.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-g20-summit-doral-resort-miami-2026-rcna229477\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>'Unconstitutional' and 'unlawful': Judges push back on Trump's expanding power</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Federal judges blocked Trump\\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, struck down his National Guard deployment in Los Angeles, halted a $2 billion Harvard funding freeze, and restored TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans. These rulings came days after an appeals court also ruled some of his tariffs unlawful.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The defeats show growing judicial resistance to Trump\\u2019s sweeping power grabs, even as the Supreme Court often sides with him. Courts are increasingly branding his actions \\u201Cunconstitutional\\u201D and \\u201Cunlawful,\\u201D while exposing his authoritarian strategy.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-legal-losses-national-guard-tariffs-rcna228941\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>How Stephen Miller is running Trump\\u2019s effort to take over D.C.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Stephen Miller is directing Trump\\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, D.C., managing arrest reports, deployment plans, and coordination with agencies. He calls the crackdown a \\u201Cmoral and spiritual war,\\u201D as federalized police and ICE now conduct deportation sweeps and aggressive patrols across the city.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Miller\\u2019s role shows D.C. is being used as a testing ground for authoritarian policing, eroding home rule, and blurring federal-local lines. With Trump planning to extend control through 2026, residents face prolonged occupation under Miller\\u2019s hardline vision.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/05/trump-dc-takeover-stephen-miller-white-house/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Chicago gears up as Trump troop deployment looms: \\u2018We aren\\u2019t helpless\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is preparing to send federal troops and ICE agents to Chicago, calling it a \\u201Chellhole\\u201D despite declining crime rates. Local leaders rejected the plan, while activists and legal groups launched \\u201Cknow your rights\\u201D campaigns and community organizing to resist.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Chicago will be the next front in Trump\\u2019s authoritarian crackdown and occupation, with Black and Latino communities bracing for profiling and unconstitutional policing. The pushback highlights both legal challenges and grassroots resistance to his militarization of U.S. cities.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/05/trump-ice-immigration-chicago-national-guard\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Misled by video of 2020 protests shown on Fox, Trump threatens to invade Portland and 'wipe out' protesters</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump threatened to send the National Guard to Portland after Fox News aired 2020 protest footage as if it were current. He claimed the city was being \\u201Cdestroyed\\u201D and vowed to \\u201Cwipe out\\u201D protesters, though this year\\u2019s demonstrations were only small gatherings outside an ICE facility.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shows Trump\\u2019s decisions are being driven by disinformation and media manipulation.

Ordered by Attorney General Pam Bondi\\u2019s \\u201Cweaponization working group,\\u201D the purge targeted prosecutors, paralegals, finance staff, and U.S. Marshals.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues weaponizing the DOJ to punish and erase those who investigated him, carrying out a purge of career staff.

Brian Kemp said he will send over 300 National Guard troops to Washington to back Trump\\u2019s federal intervention, adding to more than 2,300 already deployed. The move comes as lawsuits challenge the deployment as an unlawful \\u201Cmilitary occupation.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By sending troops, Kemp is endorsing Trump\\u2019s militarization of domestic law enforcement. His support deepens the normalization of a growing police state in the nation\\u2019s capital and beyond.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/09/05/georgia-governor-sending-300-national-guard-troops-dc-amid-trumps-crackdown.html\\\\\\\">Military.com</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>State Department Agents Are Now Working With ICE on Immigration</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The State Department\\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, normally focused on passport fraud and protecting diplomats, is now working with ICE to detain immigrants. Hundreds of DSS officers have been deputized for immigration enforcement, far outside their authority or training.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Conscripting the State Department into deportations erases agency boundaries and normalizes the misuse of federal power. Untrained agents enforcing immigration law heighten civil rights risks while advancing a far-right extremist \\u201Cremigration\\u201D agenda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/state-department-dss-agents-ice-immigration/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Washington, DC, residents press Congress to end Trump's federal law enforcement surge</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Washington, D.C. residents delivered letters to lawmakers demanding an end to Trump\\u2019s federal law enforcement surge, calling it an \\u201Cactive military takeover\\u201D and a direct threat to democracy. The protests came as the Army extended the D.C. National Guard\\u2019s active duty through Nov. 30, keeping more than 2,300 troops on the streets.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has turned the nation\\u2019s capital into a militarized zone, erasing local autonomy and using federal troops as political enforcers. Residents warn the occupation is a textbook sign of democratic backsliding and an authoritarian power grab in real time.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/washington-dc-residents-press-congress-end-trumps-federal/story?id=125275192\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>How Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans are reacting to Trump's National Guard threats</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Despite a court ruling that his Los Angeles National Guard deployment was illegal, Trump is threatening to send troops into Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Governors in Illinois and Maryland object, while Louisiana\\u2019s Republican governor has welcomed the move.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is testing how far he can use the military for domestic law enforcement. If unchecked, such deployments will normalize military occupation of U.S. cities and erode constitutional limits.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5530051/trump-national-guard-chicago-baltimore-new-orleans\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Residents of high-crime city in Republican-led Louisiana oppose Trump's troop plan</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump suggested sending National Guard troops into Shreveport, Louisiana, with support from the state\\u2019s Republican governor, but opposition from local leaders. The city\\u2019s mayor, police chief, and residents warned it would sap resources, hurt community policing, and serve as a political stunt amid falling crime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Even in GOP-led states, Trump\\u2019s militarization push is being dismissed as ineffective and harmful. Locals argue that investment in policing, youth programs, and community support would reduce violence more than troop deployments.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/residents-high-crime-city-republican-led-louisiana-oppose-trumps-troop-plan-2025-09-05/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Eric Adams eyed by Trump for Saudi Arabia ambassadorship</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is weighing NYC Mayor Eric Adams for ambassador to Saudi Arabia as Adams struggles in his reelection bid. Adams denies a formal offer but met with Trump\\u2019s team, and his exit would aid Andrew Cuomo against frontrunner Zohran Mamdani.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is meddling in NYC politics, using job offers to shape the mayoral field.

Missing were Bezos, Musk, and Nvidia\\u2019s Jensen Huang, while attendees steered clear of tariffs, immigration, and environmental costs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The deference resembled authoritarian loyalty rituals, with Big Tech aligning to Trump\\u2019s power rather than policy debate.

CNBC found her disclosures list a Bethesda home as her residence, while Maryland tax records say it was not; Kugler blames a county clerical error and denies wrongdoing.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The revelations surface as Trump escalates attacks on Fed officials, including firing Lisa Cook over mortgage claims.

Veterans say his arrest criminalizes peaceful dissent, noting he briefly locked arms with protesters outside an ICE facility.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The prosecution of a decorated veteran and refugee advocate is a chilling escalation\\u2014using sham conspiracy charges to intimidate demonstrators and silence opposition.

The base will serve as a command post for ICE and CBP raids expected to last weeks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is turning U.S. military bases into hubs for immigration raids, erasing the boundary between civilian law enforcement and military power.
