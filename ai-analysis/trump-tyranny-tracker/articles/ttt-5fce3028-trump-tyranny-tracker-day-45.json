Credit...Anna Rose Layden for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 5Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk\u2019s PAC Launches $1 Million Ad Buy Touting Trump\u2019s First 6 WeeksWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC launched a nationwide $1 million TV ad praising Trump\u2019s early presidency. The ad highlights immigration policies and government cuts, omitting Musk\u2019s central role in slashing federal spending through gutting agencies and purges.Why It Matters: After spending $280 million to elect Trump, Musk now wields unchecked influence over the government\u2014leading mass layoffs, agency shutdowns, and federal asset sales with no congressional oversight. This ad campaign cements his role as the regime\u2019s financial and political kingmaker.Source: ABC NewsMusk-Funded Group Pushes Deceptive Ads in Key Wisconsin Supreme Court RaceWhat Happened: A group backed by Elon Musk runs misleading ads and texts in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race, using a previously deployed strategy against Kamala Harris. The ads, disguised as progressive endorsements for Judge Susan Crawford, are funded by a conservative group to undermine her support among moderates.Why It Matters: Musk is deploying dark money tactics to manipulate elections, disguising attack ads as endorsements to mislead voters and tilt the judiciary in favor of conservative interests.Source: Associated PressAttorney General\u2019s Brother Runs for D.C. Bar Leadership Amid DOJ Ethics ConcernsWhat Happened: Bradley Bondi, brother of Attorney General Pam Bondi, is running for president of the D.C. Bar Association. His candidacy comes as the association may soon face complaints about DOJ officials accused of injecting politics into prosecutions.Why It Matters: With Pam Bondi aggressively targeting Trump\u2019s perceived \u201cenemies,\u201d her brother\u2019s leadership would influence the ethical oversight of DOJ lawyers. His deep ties to Trump\u2019s business associates and Elon Musk are a conflict of interest at a time when legal accountability is under scrutiny.Source: The New York TimesPacked Pacs: how billionaires in the US are bankrolling Republicans at the state levelWhat Happened: Republican candidates in state legislative races are heavily funded by billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Yass, and Betsy DeVos. These donors are pouring millions into state PACs to push an extremist right-wing agenda, targeting abortion rights, school privatization, labor laws, and voting restrictions.Why It Matters: With state legislatures playing a crucial role in shaping policy, this flood of billionaire cash is a direct assault on democracy and state capture. Republicans are using dark money to advance an extremist agenda that does not reflect the will of voters, ensuring long-term conservative dominance.Source: The GuardianCBO: GOP Must Cut Medicare or Medicaid to Meet Budget GoalsWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office reported that Republicans cannot achieve their $1.5 trillion budget-cutting goal without slashing Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Why It Matters: The GOP is pushing massive tax cuts for the ultra-rich. The only realistic way to pay for it? Gutting healthcare for tens of millions of Americans. Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsElon Musk Meets GOP to Lock DOGE Cuts Into LawWhat Happened: Musk met with Republican lawmakers to discuss using budget rescissions to legally enshrine his federal budget cuts, following a Supreme Court ruling that temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s freeze on $2 billion in foreign aid.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked power over government spending is now moving to Congress, turning his cuts into law and cementing his control over U.S. policy with zero accountability.Source: Associated PressMusk Calls for Privatizing USPS and AmtrakWhat Happened: Elon Musk, Trump's top government advisor, pushed for privatizing the U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak, claiming \u201ceverything we possibly can\u201d should be privatized. His comments follow Trump\u2019s proposal to merge USPS with the Commerce Department, a move Democrats say is illegal.Why It Matters: Musk and Trump are accelerating efforts to dismantle public services, putting essential mail delivery and transportation at risk. Privatization would prioritize profit over accessibility, gutting rural services and increasing costs for everyday Americans.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Speech to Congress Makes It Clear: They\u2019re Coming for Social SecurityWhat Happened: During his address to Congress, Trump ranted lies about alleged \u201cfraud\u201d in Social Security, signaling his regime\u2019s intent to gut the program. He also boasted about dismantling environmental protections, attacking federal workers, and withdrawing from global agreements.Why It Matters: Trump is laying the groundwork to slash Social Security under the guise of \u201cfraud prevention.\u201d His regime is already destabilizing the government, eroding democracy, and targeting social safety nets. This speech was a clear warning: they\u2019re coming for Social Security next.Source: Salon\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Moves to Dismantle Education DepartmentWhat Happened: A draft executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down the Department of Education, citing a failure of federal oversight. The move aligns with conservative plans to shift education control to the states and dismantle civil rights protections.Why It Matters: Eliminating the department would gut federal student aid, protections for marginalized students, and school funding for low-income communities. Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump Weighs Criminal Referrals in USAID PurgeWhat Happened: Trump is considering criminal referrals against USAID employees and aid recipients over alleged \u201cmisuse\u201d of funds, signaling an escalation in its efforts to shut down the agency. Acting Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco raised the possibility in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers.Why It Matters: This is a clear intimidation tactic aimed at justifying USAID\u2019s destruction and suppressing opposition. The regime\u2019s cuts and mass firings have already crippled oversight. Now, they're threatening prosecutions to dismantle U.S. foreign assistance further and silence dissent.Source: The HillTrump Plans to Eliminate Dozens of HUD OfficesWhat Happened: The Department of Housing and Urban Development plans to close field offices in 34 states and Washington, D.C., despite federal law requiring at least one office per state. The cuts would leave only six field offices nationwide, undermining HUD\u2019s ability to process mortgage insurance.Why It Matters: Slashing HUD offices will cripple access to affordable housing programs, delay mortgage insurance processing, and destabilize housing markets. The move violates federal law and forces staff relocations or terminations, worsening the housing crisis.Source: BloombergGOP Lawmaker Pushes Criminal Referrals for Democratic Mayors Over Sanctuary City PoliciesWhat Happened: Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) announced she is referring four Democratic mayors\u2014Eric Adams (NYC), Brandon Johnson (Chicago), Michelle Wu (Boston), and Mike Johnston (Denver)\u2014to the DOJ for allegedly \u201cviolating\u201d federal immigration laws by upholding sanctuary city policies. Attorney General Pam Bondi is already suing Chicago over the issue and has threatened to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.Why It Matters: This is a blatant escalation of Trump\u2019s authoritarian crackdown on immigration, using the DOJ as a political weapon to intimidate local officials. Bondi\u2019s actions signal a broader effort to defund and criminalize Democratic-led cities, further eroding federalism and local governance.Source: The HillTrump-Appointed D.C. U.S. Attorney Blacklists Law Schools With DEI ProgramsWhat Happened: D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin sent a letter to Georgetown Law\u2019s dean warning that his office will not hire students or faculty from any law school that incorporates DEI initiatives. He demanded Georgetown eliminate DEI from its curriculum, calling the school a \u201clocus\u201d of anti-Trump activity.Why It Matters: This is a direct escalation in Trump\u2019s war on DEI, now targeting elite institutions and leveraging federal hiring to enforce ideological purity.Source: The Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump\u2019s GSA Scrubs List of Government Properties for SaleWhat Happened: The General Services Administration published and then abruptly removed a list of over 400 federal properties slated for sale, including FBI and DOJ headquarters. The plan, pushed by Elon Musk\u2019s operatives, aims to shrink federal real estate by 50% and move agencies into private leases.Why It Matters: The lack of transparency raises serious concerns about corruption, privatization, and national security. The rushed sell-off of critical government buildings benefits corporate interests while gutting public infrastructure, with Musk\u2019s cronies gaining unprecedented influence over federal property decisions.Source: WIREDDOJ Opens Antisemitism Probe Into University of California SystemWhat Happened: The Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the University of California system, examining whether it allowed antisemitic discrimination during last year\u2019s pro-Palestinian protests. The probe is part of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on campus dissent.Why It Matters: This is a clear effort to intimidate students and silence political activism. Trump has already threatened to pull federal funding from universities over \"illegal protests,\" setting a dangerous precedent to suppress opposition to his regime. Today, it\u2019s framed as fighting antisemitism\u2014tomorrow, it will be used to target anyone who dares to resist the regime.Source: ReutersJudges Face Rise in Threats as Musk Attacks RulingsWhat Happened: Federal judges are facing escalating threats after Elon Musk and Trump cronies attacked them on social media, calling them \"corrupt\" and \"radical\" for blocking White House efforts to gut federal agencies. U.S. Marshals have warned of heightened security risks as threats surge.Why It Matters: Musk's rhetoric fuels dangerous attacks on judicial independence, a core pillar of democracy. By undermining the courts, Trump\u2019s sycophants are pushing authoritarian tactics to weaken checks on executive power.Source: Reuters\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News\u2018We\u2019re going backwards\u2019: the Black student unions being defunded on US campusesWhat Happened: Black Student Unions across U.S. campuses are losing funding and resources as state-level DEI bans and Trump\u2019s federal order to eliminate diversity programs take effect. At the University of Utah, the Black Cultural Center was shut down, and BSU\u2019s budget was slashed, forcing it to disassociate from the school to continue its work.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s war on DEI is erasing decades of progress in racial equity on campuses. With BSUs defunded and diversity programs dismantled, Black students at predominantly white institutions face increased isolation and fewer resources\u2014part of a broader elimination of civil rights protections.Source: The GuardianTrump DOJ Drops Lawsuit Protecting Emergency Abortion AccessWhat Happened: Trump withdrew a lawsuit challenging Idaho\u2019s extreme abortion ban, reversing Biden-era efforts to ensure emergency room access for life-threatening pregnancies. Idaho\u2019s law, one of the strictest in the country, only allows abortion if a woman\u2019s life is at risk\u2014not for serious health complications.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s actions threaten emergency abortion access and could cut funding for critical reproductive health services, including STI testing and birth control. These moves further cement his regime\u2019s anti-abortion agenda.Source: CNNMusk shares post calling for Trump to pardon Derek ChauvinWhat Happened: Elon Musk publicly urged Trump to pardon Derek Chauvin\u2019s conviction for murdering George Floyd. Chauvin remains in prison on both federal and state murder charges.Why It Matters: Musk is using his influence to push Trump toward rewriting history on police brutality. A pardon would be a direct attack on civil rights and an endorsement of white supremacist narratives. Even if Trump grants it, Chauvin will remain in prison for his state conviction.Source: Minnesota Star TribuneTrump Officials Reopen Texas Detention Center for Migrant FamiliesWhat Happened: Trump is reopening the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, to detain migrant families, reversing Biden\u2019s 2021 decision to end family detention. The facility, run by private prison contractor CoreCivic, will hold up to 2,400 parents and children, generating $180 million annually.Why It Matters: This marks a return to Trump\u2019s extremist and cruel immigration policies as he pushes for mass deportations. Detaining children has been widely condemned as inhumane, but Trump is expanding the detention capacity.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Plans to Cut 80,000 Veterans Affairs JobsWhat Happened: An internal VA memo reveals plans to slash 80,000 jobs, reversing Biden-era expansions, including positions supporting veterans exposed to burn pits under the PACT Act. The agency-wide reorganization is set for August.Why It Matters: These cuts will gut essential services for millions of veterans, reducing healthcare and benefits access while prioritizing budget reductions over veteran care.Source: Associated PressMass Federal Layoffs Will Cripple U.S. Cybersecurity, Former NSA Official WarnsWhat Happened: Rob Joyce, former NSA cybersecurity director, warned Congress that Trump and Musk\u2019s mass firings will devastate national security, eliminating critical cybersecurity talent needed to counter China\u2019s cyber threats. Over 100,000 federal workers have been forced out, including 130+ from CISA.Why It Matters: Cutting cybersecurity personnel weakens U.S. defenses against foreign cyberattacks, making critical infrastructure and federal networks more vulnerable. This reckless downsizing directly aids America\u2019s adversaries\u2014especially as the Pentagon orders a halt in offensive cyber operations against Russia.Source: ReutersPentagon Begins Civilian Layoffs Amid Trump\u2019s Defense CutsWhat Happened: The Defense Department started cutting civilian jobs this week, beginning with probationary employees at the Defense Logistics Agency. A Pentagon memo warns of further layoffs as part of a broader effort to \u201cstreamline operations.\u201dWhy It Matters: These cuts weaken military support functions while prioritizing Trump\u2019s dismantling and weakening of agencies. Civilian job losses at the Pentagon raise concerns about national security readiness and the impact on military logistics.Source: CBS NewsDOGE\u2019s IRS Cuts Will Cost More Than They SaveWhat Happened: Musk has gutted the IRS, firing specialists who audit complex corporate and wealthy tax returns. Experts warn that these cuts will reduce tax revenue far more than any projected savings.Why It Matters: By slashing IRS enforcement, Trump and Musk are ensuring billionaires and corporations can dodge taxes with impunity\u2014ballooning the deficit while shifting the tax burden onto Americans. This isn\u2019t about efficiency; it\u2019s about protecting the ultra-rich.Source: ProPublica\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Cuts Intelligence Sharing With Ukraine, Aiding RussiaWhat Happened: Trump has halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, including military targeting data and warnings about Russian missile strikes. Why It Matters: This is a blatant betrayal\u2014Trump is actively assisting Russia in its genocidal war while pressuring Ukraine to surrender and extorting them for rare minerals. By cutting critical intelligence, the U.S. is weakening Ukraine\u2019s defense while giving Russia an advantage in its daily terrorist attacks. Trump\u2019s alignment with Putin is now undeniable.Source: The New York TimesMacron Warns Russian Aggression \u2018Knows No Borders\u2019 as Trump Undermines NATOWhat Happened: French President Emmanuel Macron warned that Russian aggression will not stop at Ukraine, calling on Europe to prepare for a future without guaranteed U.S. support. In a televised address, Macron criticized Trump\u2019s cutting of U.S. aid to Ukraine and signaled that Europe must step up its defense efforts, including potentially extending France\u2019s nuclear deterrence.Why It Matters: With Trump abandoning Ukraine and threatening tariffs on European goods, Macron\u2019s speech underscores the deepening transatlantic rift. Europe now faces a stark choice: rapidly build its defense capacity or risk Russian bloody imperialist ambitions with no U.S. backing.Source: The GuardianThis Pentagon Press Secretary Has a Long History of Bigoted and Xenophobic PostsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Department of Defense hired 26-year-old Kingsley Wilson, a far-right internet provocateur with a history of racist, xenophobic, and transphobic rhetoric, as deputy press secretary. Wilson has ties to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, the Center for Renewing America, and the far-right social platform Gettr.Why It Matters: Wilson\u2019s appointment signals the Pentagon\u2019s shift toward overtly extremist rhetoric and policies. Her history of amplifying white nationalist conspiracies and attacking marginalized groups highlights how Trump\u2019s military will handle diversity, immigration, and global security.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Tariffs Shake Stock Market, Threaten 401(k) SavingsWhat Happened: The S&P 500 has dropped 3% since Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% on Chinese imports, sparking investor fears of inflation and economic slowdown.Why It Matters: With stocks tumbling and consumer sentiment weakening, retirement accounts like 401(k)s face heightened volatility. Trump's \"little disturbance\" means major losses for American workers' savings.Source: CBS NewsThe Recession Trade Is Back on Wall StreetWhat Happened: Investors are dumping bank stocks and smaller companies as fears of a recession grow. Trump\u2019s aggressive tariffs on key trading partners have rattled markets, sending the Nasdaq down 7.5% since mid-February. Why It Matters: Wall Street miscalculated\u2014assuming Trump\u2019s tariff threats were bluffs. Now, markets are scrambling as his protectionist agenda takes full effect, potentially derailing economic growth and triggering a recession.Source: The Wall Street JournalPrivate Sector Job Growth Plummets Amid Economic UncertaintyWhat Happened: Private employers added just 77,000 jobs in February\u2014far below the expected 148,000\u2014marking the weakest growth since July. Trade, transportation, and utility jobs saw a steep decline of 33,000 positions, while education and health services shed 28,000 jobs.Why It Matters: The sharp slowdown in hiring signals rising economic uncertainty, with Trump\u2019s tariffs stoking fears of inflation and stagnation. Employers appear hesitant to expand as businesses brace for potential economic turbulence.Source: CNBCTrump Tariffs to Drive Up Consumer Prices, Major Retailers WarnWhat Happened: CEOs of Best Buy, Walmart, and Target warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs would result in higher prices for American consumers. Best Buy cited China and Mexico as key suppliers, while Target highlighted immediate price hikes for fresh produce.Why It Matters: With retailers passing tariff costs onto consumers, Americans will face rising prices on everyday goods, from electronics to groceries. The tariffs will worsen inflation and weaken consumer spending, further straining the economy.Source: CBS NewsChina Warns U.S.: \"We\u2019re Ready to Fight Till the End\"What Happened: China escalated its rhetoric against the U.S., declaring its readiness for \u201cany type of war\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Beijing called the U.S. fentanyl-related justification for tariffs a \u201cflimsy excuse\u201d and announced retaliatory duties up to 15% on U.S. goods starting March 10, along with new export restrictions on American entities.Why It Matters: Tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies are reaching a breaking point, with China signaling a more aggressive stance. The escalating trade war threatens global markets and supply chains, risking broader economic and geopolitical instability.Source: CNBCCanada Pulls U.S. Liquor as Trump\u2019s Tariffs HitWhat Happened: Canadian liquor stores removed U.S. alcohol from shelves after Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect. Provinces like Quebec and New Brunswick halted American liquor purchases.Why It Matters: Retaliation will cost U.S. distilleries millions, escalating trade tensions and hurting exports. Furthermore, Trump\u2019s reckless tariffs will ruin a strong relationship between the U.S. and Canada, worsening diplomatic and economic ties.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge Blocks Trump\u2019s NIH Research CutsWhat Happened: A federal judge in Boston issued a nationwide injunction blocking Trump\u2019s plan to cut NIH research funding, citing risks to life-saving clinical trials and ongoing medical studies.Source: USA TodayUSDA Ordered to Reinstate Thousands of Fired EmployeesWhat Happened: A federal civil service board ruled that the mass firing of over 5,000 probationary USDA employees may have been unlawful, ordering their reinstatement for at least 45 days.Source: NBC NewsArchivists Recreate Pre-Trump CDC Website, Hosting It in EuropeWhat Happened: A team of volunteer archivists launched RestoredCDC.org, a mirror of the CDC website as it existed before Trump\u2019s second term, after his regime purged critical health data on vaccines, HIV care, reproductive health, and disease surveillance.Source: 404MediaTesla Sales Plummet in Europe as Musk\u2019s Politics BackfireWhat Happened: Tesla sales in Germany plunged 76% in February, part of a broader decline across Europe.
