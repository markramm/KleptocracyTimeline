  "content": "Trump seems a dark throwback to the 19th century, when the American civil war erupted | Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesShareWelcome to the relaunch of the Trump Tyranny Tracker! This is my first post, and I\u2019m still working on the format while catching up on everything that\u2019s unfolded over the past few days. This post is very long because I am covering developments over the past few days. My goal is to do a daily recap moving forward. Trump and his regime are moving quickly to consolidate power, advance their agenda, and predictably raise serious concerns about corruption, authoritarianism, and foreign influence. With so much happening, it\u2019s easy to lose track\u2014that\u2019s where this tracker comes in. It\u2019s here to spotlight the critical stories and help us all stay informed and focused\u2014as Trump and his regime throw shiny objects our way. Thanks for subscribing and please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions!\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsLaunch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA CryptocurrenciesWhat Happened: Trump and Melania Trump introduced $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrencies, with $TRUMP reaching a value of $58 billion by inauguration day. Critics, including industry experts, have labeled this as a \u201cshitcoin\u201d and a \"scam,\" highlighting that the Trumps hold 80% of the tokens, raising concerns about potential market manipulation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s concentration on token ownership and the potential for market manipulation undermine public trust and raise ethical concerns about leveraging political positions for personal financial gain. It also raises troubling questions about which foreign countries might be enriching Trump in exchange for foreign policy favors. With this blatant self-enrichment, should we now expect a Barron and Ivanka coin next?Source: CNNRepeal of Ethics RulesWhat Happened: Trump repealed ethics rules restricting executive branch employees from receiving major gifts from lobbyists and lifted bans on lobbyists taking government jobs.Why It Matters: Removing these safeguards will result in corruption within the federal government, further eroding public trust in its integrity.Source: AP NewsJared Kushner\u2019s Increased Stake in Israeli FirmWhat Happened: Jared Kushner\u2019s investment firm doubled its stake in Phoenix Financial, one of Israel\u2019s largest financial firms, just days before Trump\u2019s return to the White House. This follows a $2 billion Saudi investment in Kushner\u2019s firm.Why It Matters: This raises serious ethical concerns about leveraging political connections and influence in Middle East policy for personal financial gain, eroding trust in public service and government integrity.Source: BloombergJared Kushner and Dubai billionaire to partner on Trump hotel in SerbiaWhat Happened: Jared Kushner\u2019s investment firm, Affinity Partners, is partnering with Dubai billionaire Mohamed Alabbar to develop a luxury hotel and apartment complex in Belgrade. This project, which Trump himself considered before his 2016 presidential run, will feature a 175-room hotel and 1,500 residences, with sales set to begin this year.Why It Matters: The involvement of Kushner and the Trump brand in this international real estate deal raises significant ethical concerns, suggesting conflicts of interest and the leveraging of political connections for personal and family enrichment. This underscores broader questions about foreign influence and financial entanglements in Trump\u2019s orbit.Source: SemaforSuspension of TikTok BanWhat Happened: Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days, citing restructuring needs. Notably, the CEO of TikTok was invited to and attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, raising questions about the timing of the reinstatement.Why It Matters: The CEO\u2019s presence at the inauguration amplifies concerns about whether personal or financial interests are influencing decisions involving foreign companies, undermining transparency and public trust. Also, Trump is also blatantly ignoring a Supreme Court order and Congressional law.Source: BBCNomination of Lee Zeldin to Lead the EPAWhat Happened: Trump nominated Lee Zeldin, linked to a Qatari corruption case, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Zeldin received payments from Heritage Advisors, a firm tied to Sheikh Sultan bin Jassim Al Thani.Why It Matters: This appointment risks foreign influence over U.S. environmental policy, raising questions about ethical governance and national security.Source: PoliticoSubscribe\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsNomination of Pete Hegseth as Secretary of DefenseWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s nominee Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News commentator and loyalist, to serve as Secretary of Defense has advanced. Despite allegations of rape, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence, the Senate is advancing his nomination, with only two Republicans opposing.Why It Matters: Hegseth's lack of military leadership experience and history of controversial and loyal statements raise concerns about the politicization of the Department of Defense. His appointment will undermine the department's independence and effectiveness. Moreover, Hegseth's support for using the military to address domestic issues aligns with Trump's previous threats to deploy military force against \"the enemy from within,\" potentially leading to the use of military power against American citizens.Source: New York TimesReinstatement of Schedule FWhat Happened: Trump reinstated Schedule F, allowing for the reclassification of federal employees, making it easier to hire and fire individuals based on loyalty.Why It Matters: This action threatens the nonpartisan nature of civil service, enabling the regime to consolidate power by installing loyalists in key positions.Source: Gov ExecEmergency Declaration at the BorderWhat Happened: Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, deploying troops and bypassing congressional oversight to secure funds for the border wall.Why It Matters: Utilizing emergency powers in this manner circumvents legislative oversight, setting a dangerous precedent for executive overreach and undermining the separation of powers. In the future, Trump may use emergency powers against opposition.Source: New York TimesCreation of the Department of Government EfficiencyWhat Happened: Trump has established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), appointing Elon Musk as its head. This new agency is tasked with reducing federal bureaucracy and has been interpreted by some as a means to target and remove federal employees deemed disloyal to the regime.Why It Matters: This action will be used to consolidate power and weaken oversight within the federal government while firing disloyal employees. The creation of this non-existent agency is frankly ridiculous and unethical, particularly with Elon Musk heading it while maintaining an office in the White House and holding numerous U.S. government contracts. Musk\u2019s role raises significant concerns about conflicts of interest, especially after buying influence in the White House during the election and using his platform X to manipulate public discourse in favor of Trump during the campaign.Source: WSJ\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsRevocation of Security ClearancesWhat Happened: Trump revoked security clearances of perceived adversaries, including John Bolton. Mike Pompeo, and General Mark Milley, while granting temporary clearances to allies without standard vetting.Why It Matters: Politicizing security clearances undermines national security protocols and concentrates power by silencing dissenting voices within the government. Trump is also endangering Pompeo and Bolton who are both at risk of assassination by Iran.Source: USA Today Executive Order to \u2018End Weaponization\u2019 of Federal AgenciesWhat Happened: Trump signed an order directing investigations into alleged political biases in agencies such as the DOJ and FTC.Why It Matters: Trump aims to transform impartial institutions into tools for political retribution, undermining democratic norms and public trust.Source: LawfareJan. 6 Pardons for Insurrectionists and RiotersWhat Happened: Trump pardoned over 1,500 insurrectionists and rioters with many convicted of violent crimes during the January 6 Capitol attack, including leaders of extremist groups.Why It Matters: These pardons legitimize political violence, undermine accountability for attacks on democratic institutions, and reward loyalty to Trump. They embolden future political violence by domestic terrorist groups, criminals, and militias, signaling that such actions will be rewarded and celebrated. By doing so, Trump is effectively building a loyal private army, further eroding democratic norms and threatening national security. Additionally, these actions endanger witnesses, judges, law enforcement officials, and others who assisted in prosecuting these individuals.Source: New York TimesHouse Republicans announce new subcommittee to investigate Jan. 6What Happened: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced the creation of a new select subcommittee to investigate events before and after January 6, 2021. Johnson stated the goal is to \u201cuncover the full truth\u201d and counter what he described as \u201cfalse narratives\u201d propagated by the original January 6 Select Committee.Why It Matters: This move continues Republican efforts to rewrite the history of one of America\u2019s darkest days, downplaying the violent insurrection and shifting blame away from those responsible. By politicizing the investigation, it threatens to erode accountability, further divide the nation, and undermine efforts to safeguard democratic institutions from future attacks.Source: NBC NewsGranting Temporary Security Clearances Without VettingWhat Happened: Trump issued an executive order granting temporary six-month security clearances to incoming White House officials who have not completed the standard vetting process, citing a backlog caused by delays during his transition. These high-level clearances, including TS/SCI access, were granted to individuals without thorough reviews, including some with no prior experience handling classified information.Why It Matters: This unprecedented move jeopardizes national security by bypassing critical safeguards, potentially exposing sensitive intelligence to unvetted individuals, and straining trust with foreign intelligence partners, who may limit information-sharing due to fears of compromised security.Source: CNNPam Bondi\u2019s Appointment as Attorney GeneralWhat Happened: Trump nominated loyalist Pam Bondi to head the Department of Justice, raising concerns about bias in future prosecutions and law enforcement. During her confirmation hearing, Bondi falsely claimed that pardons for January 6th insurrectionists and rioters would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, despite mass pardons being issued.Why It Matters: Pam Bondi\u2019s refusal to condemn Trump\u2019s pardoning of insurrectionists and those who attacked law enforcement demonstrates her willingness to align with his agenda. This signals that under her leadership, the DOJ could become a weaponized tool for Trump to target the media, political opposition, and anyone who stands in his way, further dismantling democratic norms and undermining the rule of law.Trump Floats Eliminating FEMAWhat Happened: Trump proposed eliminating FEMA, citing inefficiencies and suggesting disaster response could be privatized or handled by state governments.Why It Matters: This proposal undermines federal disaster response capabilities and politicizes critical life-saving aid, posing risks to public safety during emergencies and natural disasters and providing funding to loyal red states.Source: Bloomberg via YahooSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsJim Acosta Excluded from CNN\u2019s LineupWhat Happened: CNN left Jim Acosta, a frequent Trump critic, out of its new programming lineup, leaving his role uncertain.Why It Matters: This raises concerns about regime pressures on media organizations and attempts to suppress critical voices, threatening press freedom.Source: Daily BeastDismissal of Meteorologist for Musk CriticismWhat Happened: Milwaukee meteorologist Sam Kuffel was fired after criticizing Elon Musk on social media.Why It Matters: This highlights suppression of free expression and corporate influence over public discourse.Source: GuardianThreats to Prosecute State and Local OfficialsWhat Happened: The DOJ announced a group to target local officials in sanctuary cities, potentially prosecuting them for failing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.Why It Matters: This politicizes the DOJ and threatens local and state independence, leveraging legal mechanisms to enforce political priorities.Source: New York TimesTrump Suggests Investigations into Biden What Happened: In a recent interview with Sean Hannity, Trump suggested that former President Joe Biden should be investigated, particularly scrutinizing the pardons Biden issued to several family members and political allies, including his son, Hunter BidenWhy It Matters: Trump promised retribution and this announcement signals the potential use of the Department of Justice to target political opponents, raising more concerns about the weaponization of federal agencies.Source: The Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsBirthright Citizenship Executive OrderWhat Happened: Trump signed an order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary residents.Why It Matters: This unconstitutional move undermines the 14th Amendment, threatening the foundational principle of equal citizenship. A federal judge has already blocked Trump\u2019s executive order to end birthright citizenship, calling it \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d This policy is not only a direct attack on constitutional rights but is also designed to further divide the country and marginalize vulnerable communities, exacerbating societal tensions and undermining national unity.Source: CNNDesignating GendersWhat Happened: On his first day, Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government.\u201d The order mandates that the federal government recognize only two sexes, male and female, as binary, biological, and unchangeable. It directs federal agencies to remove any policies or messages promoting gender ideology, cease funding related to such initiatives, and enforce \"sex-protective\" laws in alignment with this perspective.Why It Matters: This move targets transgender and nonbinary individuals, rolling back protections and inclusivity efforts, while signaling a broader attack on LGBTQ+ rights and diversity in public policy. It is part of a larger effort to dismantle civil rights protections across various marginalized communities.Source: The Hill Ban on Transgender Military ServiceWhat Happened: Trump reverses Biden-era order allowing transgender people to serveWhy It Matters: This discriminatory rollback targets marginalized communities and reverses protections and progress in LGBTQ+ rights. Source: PoliticoTrump revoked an anti-discrimination hiring ruleWhat Happened: As part of his directives targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, President Donald Trump revoked Executive Order 11246, a landmark civil rights order signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 to prevent discrimination in government employment and advance racial equality.Why It Matters: Revoking this order removes critical protections against discrimination for millions of Americans employed by federal contractors, weakening civil rights and reversing decades of bipartisan progress toward workplace equality.Source: The Washington PostSuspension of Refugee Admissions ProgramWhat Happened: Trump suspended refugee resettlements, including for 1,660 Afghans already cleared for entry.Why It Matters: This action places vulnerable populations at risk, undermining humanitarian commitments and tarnishing the global reputation and assurances of the U.S.Source: Washington PostTargeting Foreign Nationals in ProtestsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order targeting foreign nationals involved in anti-Israel protests and others deemed threats to national security.Why It Matters: This raises concerns about suppressing dissent and disproportionately targeting Muslim and Arab communities, harming U.S. foreign relations.Source: Times of IsraelTrump Shuts Down WH Spanish Language WebsiteWhat Happened: The Trump regime shut down the White House\u2019s Spanish-language website and social media accounts, eliminating a vital resource for millions of Spanish-speaking Americans.Why It Matters: This alienates a significant portion of the population, signaling exclusionary policies and limiting access to critical government communications for non-English speakers.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc40 Other Things to Keep an Eye OnInformation Freeze NewsWhat Happened: The Trump regime has implemented a freeze on information sharing across federal agencies, including the CDC and EPA, restricting public access to critical updates on health, science, and safety.Why It Matters: By silencing trusted agencies, the regime increases public confusion and erodes transparency, making it harder for Americans to stay informed and safe.Source: APTrump Defunds and Shuts Down Key Viral Research ProgramsWhat Happened: Trump moved to defund and shut down key viral research programs, claiming it protects Americans, but leaving the country vulnerable to emerging health threats.Why It Matters: Weakening public health research endangers Americans by increasing the risk of outbreaks while ensuring a distracted, sicker population more easily manipulated by fear.Source: WSJ\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers1,500+: Insurrectionists and rioters pardoned by Trump on his first day back in office.50: Former intelligence officials whose security clearances were revoked.75: Days given to TikTok for restructuring before facing a ban.1,660: Afghan refugees denied entry due to suspended resettlement programs.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextResult in the legal challenge to the executive order on birthright citizenship and potential legal challenges to DEI eliminations.Trump\u2019s actions towards Ukraine.The impact of Schedule F on federal workforce loyalty and job security.International reactions to the U.S.\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and WHO.Further policies targeting marginalized communities under Trump\u2019s anti-\"woke\" agenda.\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s recent actions demonstrate a sweeping effort to consolidate power, dismantle institutional checks and balances, purge disloyal civil servants, and reverse longstanding civil rights protections. These measures not only undermine democratic norms and public accountability but also set the stage for an increasingly authoritarian approach to governance, threatening the foundational principles of equality and justice.Thanks for reading Trump Tyranny Tracker!

to the relaunch of the Trump Tyranny Tracker! </strong>This is my first post, and I\\u2019m still working on the format while catching up on everything that\\u2019s unfolded over the past few days. This post is very long because I am covering developments over the past few days. My goal is to do a daily recap moving forward. </p><p>Trump and his regime are moving quickly to consolidate power, advance their agenda, and predictably raise serious concerns about corruption, authoritarianism, and foreign influence. With so much happening, it\\u2019s easy to lose track\\u2014that\\u2019s where this tracker comes in. It\\u2019s here to spotlight the critical stories and help us all stay informed and focused\\u2014as Trump and his regime throw shiny objects our way. </p><p>Thanks for subscribing and please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions!</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</strong></h3><p></p><h4><em><strong>Launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Cryptocurrencies</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump and Melania Trump introduced $TRUMP and $MELANIA cryptocurrencies, with $TRUMP reaching a value of $58 billion by inauguration day. Critics, including industry experts, have <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fb10ac4-b39e-48b7-a38b-6c71da2e555e\\\\\\\">labeled</a> this as a \\u201Cshitcoin\\u201D and a \\\\\\\"scam,\\\\\\\" highlighting that the Trumps hold 80% of the tokens, raising concerns about potential market manipulation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s concentration on token ownership and the potential for market manipulation undermine public trust and raise ethical concerns about leveraging political positions for personal financial gain. It also raises troubling questions about which foreign countries might be enriching Trump in exchange for foreign policy favors. With this blatant self-enrichment, should we now expect a Barron and Ivanka coin next?</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/politics/ethics-business-trump-presidency/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Repeal of Ethics Rules</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump <a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-revokes-ethics-rules-drain-swamp-b8e3ba0f98c9c60af11a8e70cbc902bd\\\\\\\">repealed</a> ethics rules restricting executive branch employees from receiving major gifts from lobbyists and lifted bans on lobbyists taking government jobs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Removing these safeguards will result in corruption within the federal government, further eroding public trust in its integrity.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-revokes-ethics-rules-drain-swamp-b8e3ba0f98c9c60af11a8e70cbc902bd\\\\\\\">AP News</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Jared Kushner\\u2019s Increased Stake in Israeli Firm</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Jared Kushner\\u2019s investment firm doubled its stake in Phoenix Financial, one of Israel\\u2019s largest financial firms, just days before Trump\\u2019s return to the White House. This follows a $2 billion Saudi investment in Kushner\\u2019s firm.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This raises serious ethical concerns about leveraging political connections and influence in Middle East policy for personal financial gain, eroding trust in public service and government integrity.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/trump-son-in-law-kushner-s-affinity-gets-nod-to-double-stake-in-israeli-firm?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;sref=BIAk2Vdl\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Jared Kushner and Dubai billionaire to partner on Trump hotel in Serbia</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Jared Kushner\\u2019s investment firm, Affinity Partners, is partnering with Dubai billionaire Mohamed Alabbar to develop a luxury hotel and apartment complex in Belgrade. This project, which Trump himself considered before his 2016 presidential run, will feature a 175-room hotel and 1,500 residences, with sales set to begin this year.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The involvement of Kushner and the Trump brand in this international real estate deal raises significant ethical concerns, suggesting conflicts of interest and the leveraging of political connections for personal and family enrichment. This underscores broader questions about foreign influence and financial entanglements in Trump\\u2019s orbit.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.semafor.com/article/01/17/2025/jared-kushner-and-dubai-billionaire-to-partner-on-trump-hotel-in-serbia\\\\\\\">Semafor</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Suspension of TikTok Ban</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days, citing restructuring needs. Notably, the CEO of TikTok was invited to and attended Trump\\u2019s inauguration, raising questions about the timing of the reinstatement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The CEO\\u2019s presence at the inauguration amplifies concerns about whether personal or financial interests are influencing decisions involving foreign companies, undermining transparency and public trust. Also, Trump is also blatantly ignoring a Supreme Court order and Congressional law.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyng762q4eo\\\\\\\">BBC</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Nomination of Lee Zeldin to Lead the EPA</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump nominated Lee Zeldin, linked to a Qatari corruption case, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

Despite allegations of rape, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence, the Senate is advancing his nomination, with only two Republicans opposing.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Hegseth's lack of military leadership experience and history of controversial and loyal statements raise concerns about the politicization of the Department of Defense. His appointment will undermine the department's independence and effectiveness. Moreover, Hegseth's support for using the military to address domestic issues aligns with Trump's previous threats to deploy military force against \\\\\\\"the enemy from within,\\\\\\\" potentially leading to the use of military power against American citizens.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/hegseth-defense-secretary.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Reinstatement of Schedule F</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump reinstated Schedule F, allowing for the reclassification of federal employees, making it easier to hire and fire individuals based on loyalty.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This action threatens the nonpartisan nature of civil service, enabling the regime to consolidate power by installing loyalists in key positions.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/01/how-pair-executive-orders-and-memo-could-fast-track-civil-services-politicization/402389/\\\\\\\">Gov Exec</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Emergency Declaration at the Border</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, deploying troops and bypassing congressional oversight to secure funds for the border wall.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Utilizing emergency powers in this manner circumvents legislative oversight, setting a dangerous precedent for executive overreach and undermining the separation of powers. In the future, Trump may use emergency powers against opposition.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/trump-border-emergency-declaration-immigration.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Creation of the Department of Government Efficiency</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), appointing Elon Musk as its head. This new agency is tasked with reducing federal bureaucracy and has been interpreted by some as a means to target and remove federal employees deemed disloyal to the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This action will be used to consolidate power and weaken oversight within the federal government while firing disloyal employees. The creation of this non-existent agency is frankly ridiculous and unethical, particularly with Elon Musk heading it while maintaining an office in the White House and holding numerous U.S. government contracts. Musk\\u2019s role raises significant concerns about conflicts of interest, especially after buying influence in the White House during the election and using his platform X to manipulate public discourse in favor of Trump during the campaign.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/doge-federal-reform-musk-ramaswamy-118a3833\\\\\\\">WSJ</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h4><em><strong>Revocation of Security Clearances</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump revoked security clearances of perceived adversaries, including John Bolton. Mike Pompeo, and General Mark Milley, while granting temporary clearances to allies without standard vetting.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Politicizing security clearances undermines national security protocols and concentrates power by silencing dissenting voices within the government. Trump is also endangering Pompeo and Bolton who are both at risk of assassination by Iran.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/21/trump-security-clearance-intelligence-officials/77836191007/\\\\\\\">USA Today </a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Executive Order to \\u2018End Weaponization\\u2019 of Federal Agencies</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an order directing investigations into alleged political biases in agencies such as the DOJ and FTC.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump aims to transform impartial institutions into tools for political retribution, undermining democratic norms and public trust.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-order-on--ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government\\\\\\\">Lawfare</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Jan. 6 Pardons for Insurrectionists and Rioters</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump pardoned over 1,500 insurrectionists and rioters with many convicted of violent crimes during the January 6 Capitol attack, including leaders of extremist groups.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These pardons legitimize political violence, undermine accountability for attacks on democratic institutions, and reward loyalty to Trump. They embolden future political violence by domestic terrorist groups, criminals, and militias, signaling that such actions will be rewarded and celebrated. By doing so, Trump is effectively building a loyal private army, further eroding democratic norms and threatening national security. </p><p>Additionally, these actions endanger witnesses, judges, law enforcement officials, and others who assisted in prosecuting these individuals.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/jan-6-trump-pardon-capitol-riots-video-evidence.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em>House Republicans announce new subcommittee to investigate Jan. 6</em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced the creation of a new select subcommittee to investigate events before and after January 6, 2021. Johnson stated the goal is to \\u201Cuncover the full truth\\u201D and counter what he described as \\u201Cfalse narratives\\u201D propagated by the original January 6 Select Committee.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move continues Republican efforts to rewrite the history of one of America\\u2019s darkest days, downplaying the violent insurrection and shifting blame away from those responsible. By politicizing the investigation, it threatens to erode accountability, further divide the nation, and undermine efforts to safeguard democratic institutions from future attacks.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-new-subcommittee-investigate-jan-6-rcna188808\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Granting Temporary Security Clearances Without Vetting</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump issued an executive order granting temporary six-month security clearances to incoming White House officials who have not completed the standard vetting process, citing a backlog caused by delays during his transition. These high-level clearances, including TS/SCI access, were granted to individuals without thorough reviews, including some with no prior experience handling classified information.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unprecedented move jeopardizes national security by bypassing critical safeguards, potentially exposing sensitive intelligence to unvetted individuals, and straining trust with foreign intelligence partners, who may limit information-sharing due to fears of compromised security.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-temporary-security-clearances/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Pam Bondi\\u2019s Appointment as Attorney General</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump nominated loyalist Pam Bondi to head the Department of Justice, raising concerns about bias in future prosecutions and law enforcement. During her confirmation hearing, Bondi falsely claimed that pardons for January 6th insurrectionists and rioters would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, despite mass pardons being issued.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Pam Bondi\\u2019s refusal to condemn Trump\\u2019s pardoning of insurrectionists and those who attacked law enforcement demonstrates her willingness to align with his agenda. This signals that under her leadership, the DOJ could become a weaponized tool for Trump to target the media, political opposition, and anyone who stands in his way, further dismantling democratic norms and undermining the rule of law.</p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Trump Floats Eliminating FEMA</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump proposed eliminating FEMA, citing inefficiencies and suggesting disaster response could be privatized or handled by state governments.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This proposal undermines federal disaster response capabilities and politicizes critical life-saving aid, posing risks to public safety during emergencies and natural disasters and providing funding to loyal red states.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-floats-states-not-fema-033402715.html\\\\\\\">Bloomberg via Yahoo</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h4><em><strong>Jim Acosta Excluded from CNN\\u2019s Lineup</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> CNN left Jim Acosta, a frequent Trump critic, out of its new programming lineup, leaving his role uncertain.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This raises concerns about regime pressures on media organizations and attempts to suppress critical voices, threatening press freedom.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jim-acosta-reportedly-questioning-future-at-cnn-after-network-demotes-him-to-midnight-slot/\\\\\\\">Daily Beast</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Dismissal of Meteorologist for Musk Criticism</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Milwaukee meteorologist Sam Kuffel was fired after criticizing Elon Musk on social media.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This highlights suppression of free expression and corporate influence over public discourse.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/23/elon-musk-cbs-meteorologist-salute\\\\\\\">Guardian</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Threats to Prosecute State and Local Officials</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The DOJ announced a group to target local officials in sanctuary cities, potentially prosecuting them for failing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This politicizes the DOJ and threatens local and state independence, leveraging legal mechanisms to enforce political priorities.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/justice-department-immigration-enforcement.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Trump Suggests Investigations into Biden </strong></em></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a recent interview with Sean Hannity, Trump suggested that former President Joe Biden should be investigated, particularly scrutinizing the pardons Biden issued to several family members and political allies, including his son, Hunter Biden</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump promised retribution and this announcement signals the potential use of the Department of Justice to target political opponents, raising more concerns about the weaponization of federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/trump-fox-news-interview-sean-hannity-white-house-qr3dlcvl3?region=global\\\\\\\">The Times</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h4><em><strong>Birthright Citizenship Executive Order</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary residents.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unconstitutional move undermines the 14th Amendment, threatening the foundational principle of equal citizenship. A federal judge has already blocked Trump\\u2019s executive order to end birthright citizenship, calling it \\u201Cblatantly unconstitutional.\\u201D This policy is not only a direct attack on constitutional rights but is also designed to further divide the country and marginalize vulnerable communities, exacerbating societal tensions and undermining national unity.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/politics/birthright-citizenship-lawsuit-hearing-seattle/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Designating Genders</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> On his first day, Trump signed an executive order titled \\u201CDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government.\\u201D The order mandates that the federal government recognize only two sexes, male and female, as binary, biological, and unchangeable. It directs federal agencies to remove any policies or messages promoting gender ideology, cease funding related to such initiatives, and enforce \\\\\\\"sex-protective\\\\\\\" laws in alignment with this perspective.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move targets transgender and nonbinary individuals, rolling back protections and inclusivity efforts, while signaling a broader attack on LGBTQ+ rights and diversity in public policy. It is part of a larger effort to dismantle civil rights protections across various marginalized communities.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5097278-trump-executive-order-gender-transition/\\\\\\\">The Hill </a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Ban on Transgender Military Service</strong></em></h4><p><br><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump reverses Biden-era order allowing transgender people to serve</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This discriminatory rollback targets marginalized communities and reverses protections and progress in LGBTQ+ rights. </p><p><strong>Source: <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/01/20/donald-trump-inauguration-day-news-updates-analysis/trump-repeals-transgender-troops-rule-00199577\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h4><em><strong>Trump revoked an anti-discrimination hiring rule</strong></em></h4><p></p><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As part of his directives targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, President Donald Trump revoked Executive Order 11246, a landmark civil rights order signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 to prevent discrimination in government employment and advance racial equality.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Revoking this order removes critical protections against
