  "content": "Photo by Joshua Woroniecki on UnsplashShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: September 4Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: ZoomZoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Is Accusing Foes With Multiple Mortgages of Fraud. Records Show 3 of His Cabinet Members Have Them.What Happened: Trump is targeting political enemies with \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d charges for holding multiple primary-residence loans, even though ProPublica found three of his Cabinet members \u2014 Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Sean Duffy, and Lee Zeldin \u2014 have done the same.Why It Matters: The hypocrisy shows Trump\u2019s mortgage crusade is lawfare \u2014 punishing opponents while shielding allies. By twisting routine financial practices into crimes, he\u2019s eroding the rule of law to further entrench power.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsArmy extends orders for DC National Guard through Nov. 30: OfficialsWhat Happened: The Army extended orders for the D.C. National Guard to remain on active duty in Washington through Nov. 30, with Trump retaining the power to cut the mission short or extend it indefinitely. About 950 Guard members will stay, while another 1,300 troops from out-of-state remain under separate orders through year\u2019s end.Why It Matters: The extension entrenches Trump\u2019s military occupation of the capital, turning a \u201ctemporary\u201d deployment into an open-ended presence. It normalizes martial control in civilian life and conditions Americans to accept military rule.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s pick for Federal Reserve plans to keep his White House job while on FedWhat Happened: Stephen Miran, Trump\u2019s nominee to the Federal Reserve Board, told senators he will not resign from his White House economic adviser role if confirmed. Instead, he\u2019ll take unpaid leave, an unprecedented move that would make him the first Fed governor in modern times to maintain such close ties to the regime.Why It Matters: Miran\u2019s dual role shreds Fed independence, giving Trump a direct lever over interest rate policy. By purging governors and stacking the board with loyalists, Trump will turn the central bank into a political arm of his White House.Source: Washington PostAs questions swirl about his future, Eric Adams pushes back and attacks rivals in NYC mayoral raceWhat Happened: NYC Mayor Eric Adams denied rumors he\u2019ll leave the race for a Trump regime post, though he admitted meeting Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. Adams attacked rivals Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, while Trump floated Cuomo as a stronger challenger to Mamdani.Why It Matters: Trump is meddling in NYC politics, using job offers to shape the mayoral field. Adams\u2019 troubles, Cuomo\u2019s comeback, and Mamdani\u2019s rise illustrate how Trump is extending his patronage politics into local races.Source: CNNTrump Claims the Power to Summarily Kill Suspected Drug SmugglersWhat Happened: Trump ordered the military to kill 11 people on a suspected Venezuelan drug boat, labeling traffickers \u201cterrorists\u201d and treating them as combatants. Legal experts say the strike has no precedent and amounts to murder under international law.Why It Matters: By redefining drug crime as war, Trump is granting himself the power to execute suspects without trial. This sets a dangerous precedent for war crimes, erodes the rule of law, and pushes the U.S. toward Duterte-style extrajudicial killings.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsUS justice department opens criminal inquiry into Fed governor Lisa CookWhat Happened: The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into Fed Governor Lisa Cook over alleged \u201cmortgage fraud,\u201d after Trump tried to fire her for supposedly listing two properties as her primary residence. Cook has refused to resign, sued Trump for unconstitutional removal, and insists the discrepancies stem from a clerical error.Why It Matters: This is the third DOJ \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d probe targeting Democrats and Trump\u2019s perceived enemies, part of his broader lawfare campaign to purge opponents. By weaponizing prosecutions against independent Fed governors, he\u2019s gutting central bank autonomy and shaking confidence in the U.S. economy.Source: The GuardianDoJ asks supreme court to let Trump remove Democratic FTC commissionerWhat Happened: The Justice Department petitioned the Supreme Court to let Trump remove Democratic FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter before her term ends, after lower courts blocked the firing. Judges cited long-standing precedent protecting FTC independence, but Trump argues commissioners should be fired at will.Why It Matters: Trump continues dismantling independent regulatory agencies by erasing legal job protections and packing commissions with loyalists. If the Supreme Court sides with him again, it will gut the FTC\u2019s autonomy and cement presidential control over watchdog agencies meant to be a check on abuse.Source: The GuardianTrump DOJ is looking at ways to ban transgender Americans from owning guns, sources sayWhat Happened: DOJ officials are weighing whether to bar transgender Americans from gun ownership by classifying gender dysphoria as a disqualifying mental illness. The proposal, raised after a Minneapolis church shooting, would be a major escalation in Trump\u2019s rollback of trans rights.Why It Matters: This is discrimination and hypocrisy from Trump, who blasts Democrats for \u201ctaking away\u201d guns while targeting trans Americans for collective punishment. It shows how he can weaponize federal power to strip rights \u2014 a precedent that could next hit veterans, people with PTSD, or his opponents.Source: CNNAgency That Issues Visas and Green Cards Is Hiring Armed AgentsWhat Happened: Trump is transforming U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from a benefits agency into a police force. Hundreds of new armed agents will target alleged fraud, make arrests, and pursue denaturalization cases.Why It Matters: Collapsing the line between services and enforcement weaponizes citizenship itself. What was meant to build trust now threatens immigrants with arrest at the very agency meant to process their path to legal status.Source: Wall Street JournalSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsNorthwestern University President Steps Down Amid Trump PressureWhat Happened: Northwestern President Michael Schill resigned after Trump froze $790 million in federal research funds over the school\u2019s handling of pro-Palestinian protests. The freeze has already caused hundreds of layoffs and put clinical trials in jeopardy.Why It Matters: Schill\u2019s ouster shows Trump weaponizing federal funding to punish universities and erode academic independence. Forcing leaders out under political pressure undermines free inquiry and endangers vital research\u2014and lives.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsAppeals court panel stops order to wind down operations at \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 in EvergladesWhat Happened: A federal appeals court panel voted 2-1 to block a lower court order that would have shut down \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d the immigration internment center. The facility can continue to hold detainees while the legal battle plays out.Why It Matters: This is a human rights crisis. Keeping \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d open lets Trump and DeSantis continue mass detention in isolated prisons, endangering lives and shredding basic legal protections.Source: Associated PressHow the Education Department is using civil rights laws to bring schools to heelWhat Happened: Trump officials are twisting civil rights laws to punish schools that support racial equity or transgender students, threatening to cut millions in funding. Universities like Columbia, Harvard, and Brown have also had billions frozen under Title VI \u201cantisemitism\u201d probes that imposed unrelated mandates like redefining gender.Why It Matters: Civil rights law is being inverted into a weapon of control. Schools now face a stark choice to either abandon protections for vulnerable students or lose vital federal funding. It\u2019s a politicized abuse that endangers equity, safety, and academic freedom.Source: NPRTexas Senate Passes Bill to Crack Down on Mail-Order Abortion PillsWhat Happened: Texas lawmakers approved a bill allowing nearly anyone to sue providers, manufacturers, and even delivery companies like FedEx for shipping abortion pills into the state. Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign it, with backers calling it a \u201cblueprint\u201d for other states to copy.Why It Matters: This law deputizes citizens as bounty hunters, weaponizing lawsuits to intimidate doctors, drugmakers, and couriers nationwide. It exports Texas\u2019s abortion ban across state lines, threatening access to reproductive care even in states where abortion remains legal.Source: New York TimesLouisiana prison\u2019s notoriety key to its selection as immigration jail, says NoemWhat Happened: Kristi Noem confirmed that Trump chose Louisiana\u2019s infamous Angola prison for a new ICE facility specifically to instill fear and push migrants to self-deport. Advocates warn that holding immigration detainees in a prison notorious for abuse, executions, and slave plantation origins poses grave human rights risks.Why It Matters: By using Angola as an internment site, Trump and Noem are weaponizing America\u2019s darkest prison history to terrorize immigrant communities. This expansion of mass detention blurs the line between immigration enforcement and punitive incarceration, escalating constitutional and human rights violations.Source: The GuardianFor mixed status families, deportation fears cast shadow over new academic yearWhat Happened: As schools reopen, mixed-status families are gripped by deportation fears as ICE raids spread into areas once considered safe, even near classrooms. Some parents are pulling children from activities or school altogether.Why It Matters: The fear is disrupting education for U.S. citizen children in immigrant families, with absenteeism rising. By scrapping protections for schools, hospitals, and churches, Trump has blurred legal lines and eroded trust in public institutions.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFBI employees worry Trump's Washington surge is exposing unmarked carsWhat Happened: Current and former FBI employees warned that Trump\u2019s law-enforcement surge in Washington is exposing the bureau\u2019s unmarked vehicles, burning assets critical to undercover operations. Agents forced into public patrols with tactical gear are compromising cars normally used for counterintelligence, cartel, and gang surveillance.Why It Matters: The exposure risks national security by handing foreign spies and criminal networks tools to track U.S. agents and operations. Trump\u2019s politicized \u201ccrime crackdown\u201d is undermining the FBI\u2019s ability to pursue sensitive investigations, trading long-term security for his authoritarian theater.Source: ReutersFlorida plan to end vaccine mandates will face challenges in state legislatureWhat Happened: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo proposed ending all vaccine mandates, including for schoolchildren, though the plan faces resistance in the legislature. Anti-vaccine groups cheered while the Florida Medical Association and Democrats warned it could spark a health crisis.Why It Matters: Florida could become the largest state to scrap vaccine requirements, setting a precedent that erodes decades of disease prevention. The push shows how DeSantis and RFK Jr.\u2019s anti-vaccine agenda is colliding with medical consensus and endangering public health.Source: ReutersOusted CDC head says she was pressured to preapprove vaccine panel recommendationsWhat Happened: Ousted CDC Director Susan Monarez revealed she was pressured to preapprove vaccine recommendations from RFK Jr.\u2019s hand-picked advisory panel, which replaced 17 fired experts with vaccine skeptics. Monarez refused, saying science, not ideology, must guide decisions, and was purged after resisting political interference.Why It Matters: Her account exposes how Kennedy is sabotaging vaccine standards by stacking panels with extremist anti-science appointees and sidelining experts. The purge undermines trust in the CDC, leaving America\u2019s children and communities vulnerable to preventable outbreaks.Source: ReutersPBS cuts 15% of jobs in wake of federal funding cutWhat Happened: PBS is laying off 15% of staff after Republicans cut all federal funding for public broadcasting, a $1.1 billion rollback over two years. The shutdown of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and loss of an Education Department grant have already cost more than 100 jobs.Why It Matters: The cuts imperil public broadcasting, especially rural and Native stations dependent on federal support. By defunding PBS and NPR, Trump and allies are crippling independent media and silencing educational and cultural programming that has served Americans for decades.Source: NPRWhistle-Blower Complaints Detail Tension Over Vaccines at N.I.H.What Happened: Two senior NIH scientists filed whistle-blower complaints saying they were ousted after resisting Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine vaccines, politicize grants, and defy court orders. They allege vaccine research was canceled, dissent punished, and $500 million steered to a pet project without peer review.Why It Matters: The claims show anti-vaccine ideology has seeped into NIH, threatening global health research and U.S. outbreak readiness. Critics warn politicizing science wastes taxpayer money, stifles innovation, and endangers public health.Source: New York TimesRFK Jr accused of \u2018reckless disregard for science and the truth\u2019 in Senate hearingWhat Happened: RFK Jr. was grilled in a Senate hearing, with Democrats branding him a \u201ccharlatan\u201d and demanding his resignation over vaccine rollbacks and CDC upheaval. Lawmakers in both parties pressed him on scientist firings, mRNA research cuts, and appointing vaccine skeptics to advisory panels.Why It Matters: Kennedy\u2019s policies are destabilizing public health and eroding trust in vaccines, leaving millions at risk of outbreaks. His embrace of extremist ideology over science has sparked bipartisan alarm, fueling fears Trump\u2019s health agenda will trigger preventable crises.Source: The GuardianMedical groups call on US Health Secretary Kennedy to step downWhat Happened: More than 20 top medical groups and over 1,000 current and former HHS employees urged RFK Jr. to resign. They warn his rollback of vaccine guidance, CDC purges, and embrace of anti-vaccine extremists are dismantling decades of public health progress.Why It Matters: The revolt underscores how Kennedy\u2019s leadership is eroding trust in science and exposing Americans to preventable disease. His policies mark a radical break from bipartisan health norms, with experts warning they will cause needless suffering and death.Source: ReutersTrump Administration Targets Financial Relief for Undocumented StudentsWhat Happened: Trump officials are moving to end in-state tuition and aid for undocumented students, with Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida already rolling back such programs. The Justice and Education Departments argue that the policies \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against U.S. citizens.Why It Matters: About 500,000 undocumented students could be priced out of college, weakening local economies and workforce pipelines. Critics call it a political move that sacrifices opportunity and talent for ideology.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchVenezuelan fighter jets flew over U.S. Navy ship in \"show of force\"What Happened: Two armed Venezuelan F-16s flew over the USS Jason Dunham in a \u201cshow of force,\u201d according to the Pentagon. The Navy destroyer is part of a Trump-ordered flotilla off Venezuela, deployed amid escalating tensions with President Maduro.Why It Matters: The flyover marks a dangerous escalation between U.S. and Venezuelan forces, raising the risk of direct confrontation. By doubling the bounty on Maduro and authorizing lethal strikes, Trump is steering the U.S. toward conflict in the region.Source: CBS NewsFading US Reliability Deepens Australia, Japan Security TiesWhat Happened: Australia will buy 11 Japanese warships as part of a sweeping new security pact, while Japan will share sensitive defense technology and expand troop access agreements with Canberra. The two allies also signed a deal on evacuating citizens in emergencies, deepening their economic and military integration.Why It Matters: With Trump straining alliances through tariffs and demands for higher defense spending, U.S. reliability in Asia is in question. Australia and Japan\u2019s pivot toward each other marks a regional effort to build independent deterrence against China\u2019s growing power.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Administration to End Security Programs Protecting European Allies From RussiaWhat Happened: Trump is ending a longstanding U.S. program that funded military support for Eastern European nations on Russia\u2019s border, cutting hundreds of millions in aid. He framed it as forcing Europe to take more responsibility for its defense.Why It Matters: The move guts a key deterrent against Russia just as Ukraine relies on strong allied backing. By scaling back commitments, Trump is reshaping NATO\u2019s security framework \u2014 and once again delivering for Moscow.Source: New York TimesEurope Edges Forward on Ukraine Security Guarantees as US StallsWhat Happened: Twenty-six European nations pledged troops, air, and naval support to guarantee Ukraine\u2019s security in a ceasefire, with Macron calling it a plan to turn Ukraine into a \u201cporcupine\u201d against future Russian attacks. Why It Matters: Europe is making concrete commitments while Trump offers only vague \u201cpromises\u201d of intelligence and air support as he continues providing cover for Russia. The imbalance fuels fears that Washington will stall as Europe shoulders the burden of deterring Putin amid warnings of another offensive.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsLabor market growth slows dramatically in August with U.S. adding just 54,000 jobs, ADP saysWhat Happened: Private-sector hiring rose by just 54,000 jobs in August, well below expectations of 75,000 and down from July\u2019s 106,000 gain, according to ADP. Losses in trade, transportation, utilities, education, and health were only partially offset by hospitality\u2019s 50,000-job boost.Why It Matters: The weak numbers add to mounting signs of a cooling labor market, with job openings and claims both worsening. Source: CNBCWhy Trump\u2019s firing of the US jobs chief has economists worriedWhat Happened: Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after July\u2019s weak jobs report, accusing the agency of \u201crigging\u201d numbers to make him look bad. He\u2019s nominated Heritage Foundation economist EJ Antoni, a Project 2025 contributor who has openly called for gutting the bureau.Why It Matters: For the first time, a president has purged BLS leadership over inconvenient data, jeopardizing America\u2019s most trusted economic statistics. By politicizing the numbers, Trump is eroding public trust and risking investor confidence in the U.S. economy.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News10/18- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501DC attorney general sues to end federal National Guard deploymentWhat Happened: Washington, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed suit to halt Trump\u2019s deployment of nearly 2,300 National Guard troops in the city, calling it an unlawful \u201cmilitary occupation.\u201d The lawsuit argues the deployment violates the Constitution, the Home Rule Act, and prohibitions on using the military for local policing.Source: ABC NewsMassachusetts Governor Orders Insurers to Cover State-Recommended VaccinesWhat Happened: Gov.

The move ensures coverage for COVID and other immunizations for children, pregnant people, and adults under 65.Source: The HillJudge orders Trump administration to release billions in foreign aid approved by CongressWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered Trump to release $11.5 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already approved, rejecting Trump\u2019s attempt to withhold $4.9 billion through a \u201cpocket rescission.\u201d The funds include billions for global health and HIV/AIDS programs that Trump froze by executive order.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers10/18 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action3 \u2014 Trump Cabinet members found holding multiple mortgages while he accuses foes of \u201cfraud.\u201d20+ \u2014 Major U.S. medical groups demanding RFK Jr. resign1,000+ \u2014 Current and former HHS employees joining the call for RFK Jr. to resign$500 million \u2014 Settlement framework Trump is trying to extort from Harvard to restore billions in federal research funds.11 \u2014 Japanese warships Australia agreed to buy in a new security pact.950 \u2014 D.C.

Prices continue spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Militarization of Politics \u2014 The extended D.C.

Records Show 3 of His Cabinet Members Have Them.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is targeting political enemies with \\u201Cmortgage fraud\\u201D charges for holding multiple primary-residence loans, even though ProPublica found three of his Cabinet members \\u2014 Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Sean Duffy, and Lee Zeldin \\u2014 have done the same.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The hypocrisy shows Trump\\u2019s mortgage crusade is lawfare \\u2014 punishing opponents while shielding allies. By twisting routine financial practices into crimes, he\\u2019s eroding the rule of law to further entrench power.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-cabinet-mortgage-fraud\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Army extends orders for DC National Guard through Nov. 30: Officials</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Army extended orders for the D.C. National Guard to remain on active duty in Washington through Nov. 30, with Trump retaining the power to cut the mission short or extend it indefinitely. About 950 Guard members will stay, while another 1,300 troops from out-of-state remain under separate orders through year\\u2019s end.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The extension entrenches Trump\\u2019s military occupation of the capital, turning a \\u201Ctemporary\\u201D deployment into an open-ended presence. It normalizes martial control in civilian life and conditions Americans to accept military rule.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/army-extends-orders-dc-national-guard-nov-30/story?id=125266247\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s pick for Federal Reserve plans to keep his White House job while on Fed</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Stephen Miran, Trump\\u2019s nominee to the Federal Reserve Board, told senators he will not resign from his White House economic adviser role if confirmed. Instead, he\\u2019ll take unpaid leave, an unprecedented move that would make him the first Fed governor in modern times to maintain such close ties to the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Miran\\u2019s dual role shreds Fed independence, giving Trump a direct lever over interest rate policy. By purging governors and stacking the board with loyalists, Trump will turn the central bank into a political arm of his White House.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/04/stephen-miran-white-house-federal-reserve/?location=alert\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>As questions swirl about his future, Eric Adams pushes back and attacks rivals in NYC mayoral race</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> NYC Mayor Eric Adams denied rumors he\\u2019ll leave the race for a Trump regime post, though he admitted meeting Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. Adams attacked rivals Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, while Trump floated Cuomo as a stronger challenger to Mamdani.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is meddling in NYC politics, using job offers to shape the mayoral field. Adams\\u2019 troubles, Cuomo\\u2019s comeback, and Mamdani\\u2019s rise illustrate how Trump is extending his patronage politics into local races.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/politics/eric-adams-witkoff-new-york-mayor\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Claims the Power to Summarily Kill Suspected Drug Smugglers</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered the military to kill 11 people on a suspected Venezuelan drug boat, labeling traffickers \\u201Cterrorists\\u201D and treating them as combatants. Legal experts say the strike has no precedent and amounts to murder under international law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By redefining drug crime as war, Trump is granting himself the power to execute suspects without trial. This sets a dangerous precedent for war crimes, erodes the rule of law, and pushes the U.S. toward Duterte-style extrajudicial killings.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/politics/trump-drug-smugglers-military.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>US justice department opens criminal inquiry into Fed governor Lisa Cook</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into Fed Governor Lisa Cook over alleged \\u201Cmortgage fraud,\\u201D after Trump tried to fire her for supposedly listing two properties as her primary residence. Cook has refused to resign, sued Trump for unconstitutional removal, and insists the discrepancies stem from a clerical error.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is the third DOJ \\u201Cmortgage fraud\\u201D probe targeting Democrats and Trump\\u2019s perceived enemies, part of his broader lawfare campaign to purge opponents. By weaponizing prosecutions against independent Fed governors, he\\u2019s gutting central bank autonomy and shaking confidence in the U.S. economy.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/04/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-mortgage-investigation\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>DoJ asks supreme court to let Trump remove Democratic FTC commissioner</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department petitioned the Supreme Court to let Trump remove Democratic FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter before her term ends, after lower courts blocked the firing. Judges cited long-standing precedent protecting FTC independence, but Trump argues commissioners should be fired at will.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues dismantling independent regulatory agencies by erasing legal job protections and packing commissions with loyalists. If the Supreme Court sides with him again, it will gut the FTC\\u2019s autonomy and cement presidential control over watchdog agencies meant to be a check on abuse.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/trump-administration-supreme-court-ftc-rebecca-slaughter\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump DOJ is looking at ways to ban transgender Americans from owning guns, sources say</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> DOJ officials are weighing whether to bar transgender Americans from gun ownership by classifying gender dysphoria as a disqualifying mental illness. The proposal, raised after a Minneapolis church shooting, would be a major escalation in Trump\\u2019s rollback of trans rights.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is discrimination and hypocrisy from Trump, who blasts Democrats for \\u201Ctaking away\\u201D guns while targeting trans Americans for collective punishment.
