(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 26Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Announces $1 Million to Wisconsin Voter in Supreme Court Race, Critics Call It \u2018Corrupt\u2019What Happened: Musk awarded $1 million to a voter in Green Bay days before Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal state Supreme Court election. His PAC had previously offered $100 to voters signing a petition opposing \u201cactivist judges.\u201d Musk backs conservative candidate Brad Schimel in a race that could flip court control.Why It Matters: Musk is attempting to buy influence in a race that could impact Tesla\u2019s pending litigation. Legal experts warn the payment may violate Wisconsin laws against voter inducement, sparking concerns over election integrity and judicial independence.Source: Associated PressTesla\u2019s Wisconsin Lawsuit, Elon Musk, and Brad SchimelWhat Happened: Tesla sued the state of Wisconsin in January, challenging the state's \u201cfactory store\u201d law, which bars vehicle manufacturers from directly selling cars. The lawsuit, initially filed in Outagamie County, was recently moved to Milwaukee County.Why It Matters: Musk has poured over $18 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who would influence Tesla\u2019s legal fight.Source: Milwaukee Journal SentinelInside Maye Musk\u2019s Cozy Relationship With ChinaWhat Happened: As Musk consolidates power in U.S. politics, his mother Maye Musk has become a prominent figure in China\u2014modeling for Chinese brands, attending state-linked events, and promoting Tesla. Why It Matters: Maye Musk\u2019s deep ties to Chinese state-linked media and brands raise serious questions about influence, loyalty, and soft-power optics\u2014especially as Musk wields enormous political power in the U.S. and profits from China\u2019s market. Source: WIREDSpaceX Quietly Opens Door to Chinese Investment Through Offshore Secrecy HubsWhat Happened: Court records reveal that Musk\u2019s SpaceX, a major U.S. military contractor, permits Chinese investors to buy into the company\u2014so long as the money flows through offshore secrecy jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands.Why It Matters: While SpaceX builds spy satellites for the U.S. government, it\u2019s quietly letting Chinese investors in through offshore loopholes. This is a deliberate tactic to hide foreign influence\u2014and potentially puts U.S. defense secrets at risk. This isn\u2019t just corruption\u2014it\u2019s dangerous.Source: ProPublicaFossil Fuel Companies Get Direct Email Line to Trump for Exemption RequestsWhat Happened: The Trump EPA created an email portal allowing fossil fuel companies to request presidential exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations. These waivers, valid for up to two years, let polluters bypass rules meant to limit toxic emissions like mercury and arsenic.Why It Matters: Trump is exploiting a rarely used provision of the law to fast-track deregulation\u2014without public debate or congressional oversight. It\u2019s a blatant favor for donors and a direct threat to public health. Environmental groups are demanding transparency and legal accountability.Source: The GuardianSenate Votes to Overturn CFPB Overdraft Rule, in New Blow for AgencyWhat Happened: The Senate repealed a Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule capping bank overdraft fees. The repeal, passed under the Congressional Review Act, blocks similar future regulations and now heads to the House, where a companion bill has already advanced.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting the CFPB.

Some agencies may lose thousands of employees. The memo outlines early drafts of \u201creduction in force\u201d plans being prepared under Trump\u2019s February executive order directing a federal workforce purge.Why It Matters: These cuts driven by Trump and Musk will gut essential services, cripple agency functions, and further centralize executive power.

Officials claim the app is authorized and used for \u201cfast-moving\u201d matters. But former national security and White House personnel say Signal is not compliant with record-keeping laws like the Presidential Records Act, especially due to its disappearing messages feature.Why It Matters: The regime\u2019s routine use of Signal raises alarms over transparency, national security, and legality. Previous administrations restricted or disabled such messaging apps for official use. This highlights a broader pattern of shielding sensitive government business from public and legal scrutiny.Source: The IndependentBondi Signals Criminal Probe Into Signal Chat Unlikely, Despite National Security ConcernsWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated she\u2019s unlikely to pursue a criminal investigation into the Signal group chat leak. The FBI has a long history of such probes, but Bondi echoed Trump\u2019s view that the matter \u201cisn\u2019t really an FBI thing,\u201d dismissing claims that the messages\u2014which included exact launch times\u2014were classified.Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s refusal to investigate the Signal leak is outrageous and another example that the DOJ is no longer an independent agency.

She specifically targeted Judges Ana Reyes, James Boasberg, and Beryl Howell, claiming they were obstructing Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s demand to remove judges for rulings Trump doesn\u2019t like is a direct attack on judicial independence.

The DOJ admitted Trump failed to comply but argued notification wasn\u2019t mandatory. The judge said she may not be able to reinstate the watchdogs\u2014but confirmed the law was violated.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass firing of independent watchdogs\u2014without even following basic legal procedures\u2014shows a flagrant disregard for oversight and accountability.

Executives left the call rattled, fearing retaliation if they did so.Why It Matters: Trump is threatening automakers not to raise prices\u2014even as his tariffs force up production costs by thousands per vehicle.

The visit\u2014complete with staged photo ops in front of shirtless, caged men\u2014was condemned as \u201cpolitical theater\u201d by human rights advocates.Why It Matters: This public spectacle mirrors Kremlin-style propaganda, using inhumane detention as a warning tactic.

The decision was justified by a Trump-appointed official citing misalignment with \u201cnational interest.\u201dWhy It Matters: This erases decades of progress in protecting vulnerable workers, including children. Programs being cut have helped thousands of children leave exploitative work and trained hundreds of labor inspectors.

Despite Gladys receiving a one-year extension that morning, the decision was abruptly reversed. The couple was detained separately, shackled at the wrists and ankles, and transported across state lines in secrecy.Why It Matters: This is what Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda looks like in practice: cruelty, chaos, and zero accountability.

Some detainees, like Rumeysa Ozturk and Alireza Doroudi, had no criminal records and were targeted for political speech. Why It Matters: This is a First Amendment crisis.

The accounts exposed contact lists and past transactions, including links to conspiracy theorists and personal payments with emoji notes.Why It Matters: This is a national security failure. Foreign adversaries could exploit exposed networks, connections, and payment patterns to build leverage against U.S. officials. It\u2019s reckless behavior from the very people entrusted with the country\u2019s most sensitive operations.Source: WIREDMike Waltz's Venmo account showed his contacts \u2014 even after bombshell report on secret Signal chatWhat Happened: Even after the leak of sensitive U.S. military strike details in a Signal chat, top Trump officials\u2014including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and DNI Chief of Staff Joe Kent\u2014left their Venmo accounts exposed, revealing contacts that include journalists, defense contractors, and lawmakers. Some accounts weren\u2019t made private until after media inquiries.Why It Matters: These officials not only leaked classified info on Signal\u2014they failed basic cybersecurity hygiene. Open Venmo contact lists are a goldmine for foreign intelligence agencies.

The error was immediately reported and caused no harm. Yet unlike Trump officials involved in the Signal chat leak, she faces harsh punishment.Why It Matters: This double standard highlights Trump\u2019s politicized enforcement of security protocols.

Acid rain, caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, severely damaged US ecosystems before landmark 1990 legislation curbed it.Why It Matters: Likens says Trump\u2019s rollback of pollution rules and defunding of monitoring programs threatens to erase decades of environmental progress. \u201cIf the Trump administration starts releasing controls on emissions, we are going to destroy that success story,\u201d he said.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIsrael Supplied Intel for Houthi Airstrike Discussed in Leaked Signal ChatWhat Happened: U.S. officials confirmed Israel provided human intelligence that helped identify a top Houthi missile expert targeted in a U.S. airstrike discussed in a leaked Signal group chat between Trump officials. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz relayed real-time details\u2014including that the target had entered his girlfriend\u2019s building, which was later destroyed.Why It Matters: The leak of Israeli-supplied human intelligence in the Signal chat exposes serious national security failures.
