(AP Photo/Eric Gay)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 2-3Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 10Google Meet: August 5, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsDonor List Suggests Scale of Trump\u2019s Pay-for-Access Operation Donor List Exposes Pay-for-Access SchemeWhat Happened: New filings show MAGA Inc. raised $177 million in six months as wealthy donors, particularly from crypto, bought access to Trump through dinners, White House events, and donations that led to pardons, ambassadorships, and advisory posts.Why It Matters: Trump continues openly trading money for access and favors, blurring the line between governance and personal enrichment. Trump\u2019s second term has become a marketplace where policy influence, federal contracts, and pardons are available for the right price.Source: New York TimesElon Musk, Crypto Help Boost Trump Super PAC to New HeightsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s main super PAC, MAGA Inc., reported nearly $200 million on hand for the 2026 midterms. Major donors include Elon Musk ($5 million), tech billionaire Marc Andreessen, crypto firms like Blockchain.com, and corporations including Altria and AMD, with some donations arriving as cryptocurrency.Why It Matters: A flood of billionaire and corporate cash is attempting to help lock in Republican control of Congress and push U.S. politics further under oligarchic rule. It also cements Trump\u2019s reliance on tech, crypto, and corporate elites to finance his authoritarian agenda.Source: NOTUSDid RNC Chair Michael Whatley Help Run a Fossil Fuel \u201cFront Group\u201d?What Happened: Michael Whatley, RNC chair and Trump-backed Senate candidate, spent over a decade as an executive at Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit built and run by fossil fuel lobbyists. Funded by Big Oil, CEA has been accused of running astroturf campaigns, submitting fraudulent letters to regulators, and using social justice rhetoric to advance pro-fossil fuel agendas.Why It Matters: Whatley\u2019s record of covert lobbying and anti-renewable campaigns underscores the growing influence of corporate energy money within GOP leadership.Source: Mother JonesPfizer CEO attending $25 million fundraiser at Trump's golf club after president demands drug price cuts, sources sayWhat Happened: Just a day after Trump demanded 17 pharmaceutical companies slash U.S. drug prices under threat of federal action, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla attended a $25 million MAGA Inc. fundraiser at Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club. Trump vowed drug prices would drop by up to 1,200% while courting industry executives behind closed doors.Why It Matters: More pay-to-play politics. Trump is simultaneously threatening and soliciting Big Pharma for massive campaign cash, blurring the line between public policy and personal political fundraising.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump and his allies mount a pressure campaign against US elections ahead of the midtermsWhat Happened: Trump and his allies are waging a nationwide campaign to take control of election systems before the 2026 midterms. Federal agencies are demanding voter data, the DOJ is pressuring states to sign information-sharing agreements, the RNC is suing for voter rolls, and Texas is redrawing maps to add GOP seats. Trump-linked operatives have even approached Colorado clerks seeking access to voting machines.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated push to federalize and rig elections. Trump is converting state-run voting into a White House-controlled apparatus, weakening safeguards and paving the way to steal the 2026 midterms. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more critical than ever for everyone to turn out and vote.Source: CNNTexas House panel advances redrawn congressional map that would add more GOP seatsWhat Happened: A Texas House panel approved a congressional map adding five new GOP-leaning districts, drawn to favor Trump-aligned candidates. Democrats say it dilutes Black and Latino voting power by packing minority voters into fewer districts and dismantling seats meant to ensure representation.Why It Matters: The map could cement Republican dominance in Texas, expanding GOP House seats while diminishing Black and Latino representation. Even if courts strike it down later, the gerrymander will shape several election cycles before any changes occur.Source: Texas TribuneThe Justice Department seeks voter and election information from at least 19 states, AP findsWhat Happened: The Justice Department is demanding voter registration lists and election records from at least 19 states, including data from past elections. DOJ lawyers are also pushing states to enter \u201cinformation-sharing agreements,\u201d and investigate alleged \u201cvoter fraud\u201d\u2014a move critics say intimidates officials and oversteps federal authority.Why It Matters: The DOJ, once tasked with protecting voting rights, is now weaponized to collect sensitive voter data, intimidate election officials, and pressure states ahead of the 2026 midterm.Source: Associated PressTrump \u2018wants his own people\u2019 in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the White House saysWhat Happened: Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after a weak jobs report, falsely claiming the data was \u201crigged\u201d against him. The White House says he wants \u201chis own people\u201d to make job numbers \u201cmore reliable,\u201d sparking suspicion of future political manipulation of economic data.Why It Matters: By purging independent statisticians and installing loyalists, Trump will turn trusted economic reporting into political propaganda, undermining public trust in government data\u2014just like in Russia, where data is manipulated to further the Kremlin\u2019s agenda.Source: New York TimesPalantir Is Extending Its Reach Even Further Into GovernmentWhat Happened: As Trump slashes billions from traditional contractors, Palantir\u2014cofounded by Peter Thiel\u2014has become the government\u2019s primary software provider, winning massive contracts with the Pentagon, IRS, and ICE. Partnering with former rivals, it\u2019s embedding AI-driven platforms across federal agencies.Why It Matters: Palantir is becoming the single gatekeeper of federal operations, embedding AI and surveillance tools deep into U.S. governance\u2014fusing vast datasets that could be weaponized for surveillance and control.Source: WIREDHow Trump\u2019s crackdown on law firms is undermining legal defenses for the vulnerableWhat Happened: A Reuters investigation found that Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting law firms have gutted pro bono work and diversity initiatives across Big Law. Fearing retaliation, elite firms have withdrawn from cases challenging Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, voting rights, and civil liberties\u2014leaving nonprofits struggling to find lawyers to defend low-income and marginalized communities.Why It Matters: By coercing law firms into compliance, Trump is dismantling checks on executive power, stripping vulnerable Americans of their right to counsel, and bending the justice system to serve his authoritarian agenda.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsFederal agency opens inquiry into ex-special counsel Jack Smith over Trump investigationsWhat Happened: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel opened a Hatch Act inquiry into former DOJ special counsel Jack Smith, who prosecuted Trump over January 6 and classified documents. GOP Sen. Tom Cotton pushed for the probe, alleging Smith \u201cinterfered\u201d with the 2024 election. Smith resigned in January before either case went to trial.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating his campaign of retaliation against his perceived enemies, weaponizing taxpayer-funded agencies to do it. While the agency can\u2019t bring criminal charges, it could pursue disciplinary actions.Source: The GuardianChristopher Wray referred to DOJ over claims he misled lawmakers on Catholic memo, China probesWhat Happened: A watchdog referred ex-FBI Director Christopher Wray to the DOJ for allegedly \u201clying\u201d to Congress about an FBI memo targeting Catholics as extremists and downplaying its scope. Why It Matters: Trump is escalating his retribution, weaponizing federal agencies to go after his perceived enemies. This sends a chilling message to current officials who choose to follow the rule of law, as they watch Trump retaliate against those who once stood up to him.Source: Fox NewsSenate confirms former Fox News host Pirro as top federal prosecutor for the nation\u2019s capitalWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed former Fox News host and Trump loyalist Jeanine Pirro as U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C.. Pirro, a longtime Trump ally entangled in a $2.7 billion election lies lawsuit, now holds one of the nation\u2019s most powerful prosecutorial posts overseeing federal cases in the capital.Why It Matters: Trump has installed another loyalist in a powerful position. Pirro will oversee D.C.\u2019s federal prosecutions, a role central to cases involving political corruption and January 6 investigations. This is another step in dismantling independent law enforcement and turning justice into a political weapon.Source: Associated PressSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsBlue-state Democrats want immigration agents to show their facesWhat Happened: Democratic lawmakers in California, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are introducing bills to ban federal immigration officers from wearing masks during raids. The proposals, spurred by public outrage over secretive arrests and deportations, aim to force visible identification on federal agents.Why It Matters: With Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign escalating, masked federal agents are operating like secret police, heightening fear in immigrant communities. Blue states are testing legal boundaries to resist these Kremlin-style tactics and demand transparency in federal immigration enforcement.Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE crackdown imperils Afghans who aided U.S. war effort, lawyers sayWhat Happened: 2 former Afghan interpreters for U.S. forces, both vetted and following legal immigration processes, have been detained by ICE and face deportation. This is part of a broader rollback of programs protecting over 250,000 Afghans who aided the U.S. during its 20-year war.Why It Matters: This is a betrayal of America\u2019s wartime allies. Trump\u2019s crackdown abandons Afghans who risked their lives for U.S. troops, sending them back to near-certain execution and undermining future U.S. military credibility and alliances.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Faces Pentagon Chaos Amid Infighting and MismanagementWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth\u2019s leadership is under fire\u2014again\u2014as internal Pentagon turmoil grows. Hegseth has clashed with top generals, purged senior aides, blocked promotions, and mishandled a trillion-dollar defense budget request. His inexperience and reliance on a small circle of loyalists has left the Pentagon understaffed and in disarray.Why It Matters: With global threats rising, America\u2019s defense leadership is crippled by dysfunction. Hegseth\u2019s loyalty to Trump and feuds with military brass are undermining national security and U.S. military readiness at a critical moment.Source: Wall Street JournalFederal judge will decide whether Trump ally Alina Habba can lead prosecutions in New JerseyWhat Happened: A federal judge will decide whether Alina Habba, Trump\u2019s pick to lead federal prosecutions in New Jersey, can legally continue as acting U.S. attorney. Trump and Pam Bondi maneuvered to keep Habba in the role despite her expired appointment, sparking constitutional challenges that are disrupting ongoing prosecutions.Why It Matters: If the court removes Habba, it could throw New Jersey\u2019s federal justice system into turmoil. It exposes Trump\u2019s broader strategy of sidestepping Senate confirmation to embed loyalists with unchecked prosecutorial power.Source: PoliticoClimate Skeptics Are Tapped by Trump Administration to Justify Regulatory RollbackWhat Happened: Trump officials commissioned a report from five climate science skeptics to challenge decades of research linking greenhouse gas emissions to global warming and public health risks. The report is being used to roll back the EPA\u2019s legal authority to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, setting the stage for a major court battle.Why It Matters: This weaponizes fringe science to dismantle environmental protections, undermining global climate policy and public health. It\u2019s a deliberate attempt to erase scientific consensus, shield polluting industries, and reverse decades of progress in combating climate change.Source: Wall Street JournalKennedy targets vaccination injury programWhat Happened: RFK Jr. pledged sweeping changes to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, criticizing it as \u201ccorrupt and broken.\u201d Kennedy has suggested adding autism and other conditions to the program\u2019s recognized injuries and hinted at altering vaccine manufacturers\u2019 liability protections, alarming public health experts.Why It Matters: This threatens the foundation of childhood vaccination in the U.S. Weakening VICP would drive drugmakers from the market, limit vaccine access, and fuel more anti-vaccine disinformation, risking a public health crisis.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIndia to still buy oil from Russia despite Trump threats, say officialsWhat Happened: Indian officials denied reports that its refineries would stop buying Russian oil, despite Trump threatening sanctions on countries trading with Moscow. Russia supplies 35% of India\u2019s crude imports.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s \u2018Slap in the Face\u2019 Puts Neutral Switzerland in Trade-War CrossfireWhat Happened: Trump blindsided Switzerland with a 39% tariff\u2014among the highest globally\u2014despite months of negotiations and Swiss offers of $150 billion in U.S. investment. The move stunned Swiss businesses, which rely heavily on U.S. exports, and has triggered fears of factory closures, economic fallout, and a deeper shift toward the EU.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade is targeting a neutral ally, destabilizing decades of strong U.S.-Swiss relations. It threatens Swiss manufacturing, pharma, and food industries while signaling that no partner\u2014friend or foe\u2014is safe from Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Launched Record 6,129 Drones Against Ukraine in JulyWhat Happened: Russia launched a record 6,129 Shahed-type drones on Ukraine in July, surpassing June\u2019s 5,337. Daily swarms now hit up to 728 drones, devastating civilian areas and causing mass casualties\u2014an enormous escalation from 423 drones in July 2024. Ukrainian officials warn the true count may be higher as Russia ramps up drone production.Why It Matters: Russia is escalating its genocidal war while the international community does little to stop it. Ukraine\u2019s air defenses are overwhelmed as drones deliberately target Ukrainians in their sleep, hospitals, and vital infrastructure. Ukraine urgently needs stronger air defense support.Source: Kyiv IndependentIAEA reports hearing explosions, sees smoke near Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plantWhat Happened: The International Atomic Energy Agency reported hearing explosions and observing smoke near Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s relentless attacks keep civilians under constant threat and heighten the danger of a catastrophic radiation disaster that could spread far beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.Source: ReutersIn a Ukrainian Maternity Ward, a Russian Missile Delivered DeathWhat Happened: In Kamianske, Ukraine, a Russian missile strike killed 23-year-old Diana Koshyk and her unborn son while she was in a maternity hospital. Russia continues indiscriminately firing missiles into civilian areas.Why It Matters: This tragedy highlights Russia\u2019s deliberate targeting of populated areas and hospitals in violation of international law. It shows the devastating toll on Ukrainian families and underscores the urgent need to hold Russia accountable for genocide and war crimes.Source: Washington PostSenate leaving Russia sanctions power fully in Trump\u2019s handsWhat Happened: Senate Republicans are leaving Washington without passing a sweeping sanctions bill that would target Russia\u2019s wartime economy, leaving the decision entirely to Trump, who has \u201cthreatened\u201d\u2014but not committed\u2014to sanctioning Russia.Why It Matters: Given Trump\u2019s record of appeasing Putin, it raises serious doubts that meaningful sanctions will be enacted, allowing Moscow\u2019s oil revenues to keep funding its genocidal war.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsAfter a Lag, Consumers Begin to Feel the Pinch of TariffsWhat Happened: After months of muted effects, businesses are now hiking prices on appliances, toys, and clothing as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs hurt profit margins. Major companies like Procter & Gamble and Adidas have announced increases, with economists warning sharper cost spikes in the next three to six months.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s baseless rhetoric that foreign exporters would pay, data show Americans are paying for his trade war. Inflation is climbing as tariffs ripple through supply chains, straining household budgets and destabilizing the economy.Source: New York TimesEconomic fears of investors are here \u2014 and fed by Trump\u2019s reactionWhat Happened: Investor confidence sank as Trump\u2019s economic policies stoked fears of a slowdown. Markets reacted not only to July\u2019s weak jobs report of just 73,000 jobs added but also to Trump\u2019s purge of the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief and his escalating attacks on the Federal Reserve.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic economic moves are stalling growth, shrinking the labor force, and undermining trust in federal data. Coupled with 1930s-style tariffs and authoritarian control of key agencies, these actions are driving market volatility and threatening long-term economic stability.Source: Washington PostIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s economy now. The latest financial numbers offer some warning signsWhat Happened: Six months into his second term, Trump\u2019s tariffs, tax shifts, and deregulation have dragged growth to 1.3%, driven inflation to 2.6%, cost 37,000 manufacturing jobs, and collapsed net hiring to just 73,000 in July. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are spiking prices, hiring is slowing, and markets are rattled as economists warn Trump\u2019s chaotic policies could trigger long-term stagnation and higher costs.Source: Associated PressFood Stamp Cuts Could Deal a Blow to Small GrocersWhat Happened: Trump signed a domestic policy bill slashing SNAP, expanding work requirements, and shifting costs to states. The cuts could strip benefits from millions, forcing rural families to travel farther for groceries as small stores, dependent on SNAP revenue, face layoffs, price hikes, or closure.Why It Matters: The cuts will deepen hunger, cripple rural economies, and could wipe out local grocers, creating food deserts in areas already struggling to survive.Source: New York TimesUnemployed Americans Endure Longer Job Searches in a Cooling MarketWhat Happened: Over 1.8 million Americans have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks\u2014the highest since 2017 outside the pandemic\u2014as job growth stalls and companies slow hiring. Labor force participation has fallen to a three-year low, with economists blaming Trump\u2019s policies for shrinking the workforce.Why It Matters: Long-term unemployment is climbing, wages are stagnating, and millions are depleting savings or abandoning job searches altogether. The economy is leaving workers behind with no clear recovery in sight.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Texas Democrats flee state to prevent vote on redrawing congressional mapWhat Happened: About 30 Texas Democrats left the state for Illinois to deny Republicans a quorum and block a congressional map that would give the GOP five new House seats. The plan, pushed by Trump, targets Democratic districts in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and South Texas. Gov. Greg Abbott has tied disaster aid to passing the map, while Republicans threaten fines and arrests for fleeing lawmakers.Source: The GuardianPritzker says Texas Democrats who fled state will be protected amid arrest threatsWhat Happened: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker pledged to protect Texas Democrats who fled their state to block a Trump-backed GOP redistricting plan that would add five Republican-leaning House seats. Texas AG Ken Paxton threatened to have them arrested and dragged back to Austin, while each faces $500 daily fines for breaking quorum.Source: The HillHow the courts became the biggest roadblock to Trump\u2019s plansWhat Happened: Federal judges have issued roughly 35 nationwide injunctions in Trump\u2019s first six months, blocking major policies on immigration, citizenship, funding cuts, and civil rights. A June Supreme Court ruling curtailed judges\u2019 ability to issue nationwide injunctions, slowing legal challenges but allowing exceptions in cases like the ongoing birthright citizenship fight.Source: The GuardianICE Racial Profiling Ban in LA Is Backed by Appeals CourtWhat Happened: A federal appeals court upheld a judge\u2019s order blocking ICE agents in Los Angeles from using racial profiling during immigration sweeps. The ruling prevents agents from stopping or questioning individuals based on race, language, or location while a lawsuit over Trump\u2019s mass deportation tactics proceeds.Source: BloombergFEMA plans to release nearly $1 billion in security funding after CNN report on proposal to slash itWhat Happened: Days after internal memos revealed plans to slash nearly $1 billion in disaster preparedness and homeland security grants, FEMA reversed course and announced states can now apply for the funding. The change followed a CNN report exposing the cuts, which FEMA documents warned would leave the nation less secure. Another reason why the independent press is crucial.Source: CNNSeveral former Justice Department attorneys seek elected office \u2014 some to fight policies enacted by TrumpWhat Happened: A wave of former Justice Department attorneys\u2014disillusioned by Trump\u2019s politicization of the DOJ, dismantling of anti-corruption units, and attacks on civil rights\u2014are leaving careers as federal prosecutors to run for elected office. Candidates like Ryan Crosswell, Erika Evans, and Hetal Doshi are campaigning to restore the rule of law and fight Trump\u2019s policies from the outside.Source: CBS NewsJudge blocks expedited deportations of those who entered the U.S. legally, possibly curtailing ICE courthouse arrestsWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s directives allowing ICE to place migrants\u2014legally admitted under humanitarian parole\u2014into expedited removal, which has been used to arrest people immediately after immigration court hearings. The ruling temporarily protects hundreds of thousands of migrants from being deported without due process.Source: CBS News\u2018Rage Against the Regime\u2019 Protests What Happened: Thousands joined nearly 350 protests across the U.S. this weekend, organized by the 50501 movement.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Pay-to-Play Regime \u2014 Billionaire donors and corporate elites are openly buying access to Trump, turning policymaking into a marketplace for favors.Institutional Capture \u2014 Federal agencies, from the DOJ to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are being purged of independents and packed with loyalists to control data and justice.Resistance Rising \u2014 Protests, legal challenges, and state-level pushback are mounting, but the authoritarian clampdown is rapidly expanding.Civil Rights Erosion \u2014 Mass deportations, bans on asylum, and secret police tactics are dismantling basic human rights and freedoms.Climate and Science Rollback \u2014 Fringe science and corporate lobbyists are dismantling environmental protections, undoing decades of progress against climate change.Retribution Escalating \u2014 Trump continues weaponizing federal agencies to punish perceived enemies, sending a chilling message to current civil servants who uphold the rule of law.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

everyone assumes that Trump is covering up the Epstein files because those files reveal him to be some kind of pedophile. But what if the files instead reveal that Trump and Epstein were working together to launder Russian money? It\u2019s hardly a secret that Trump\u2019s real estate projects from the 1980s to early 2000s wre rife with Russian oligarch money - oligarchs buying apartments in Trump Tower, oligarchs lending the Trump Organization money to build hotels, and so on. If Epstein and Trump were friends who liked doing real estate deals with Russian money, it seems reasonably likely to me that they might have done some deals together.\"</span></p><p><span><a

Trump vowed drug prices would drop by up to 1,200% while courting industry executives behind closed doors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More pay-to-play politics.

Federal agencies are demanding voter data, the DOJ is pressuring states to sign information-sharing agreements, the RNC is suing for voter rolls, and Texas is redrawing maps to add GOP seats. Trump-linked operatives have even approached Colorado clerks seeking access to voting machines.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a coordinated push to federalize and rig elections.
