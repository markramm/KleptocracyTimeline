The top 25 will get VIP access and a White House tour. Some dumped their coins right after qualifying.Why It Matters: Another blatant pay-to-play scheme, letting anonymous investors, including foreign entities, buy access to Trump while posing a national security risk. Meanwhile, Trump deregulates crypto as he and his family profit.Source: WIREDEric Trump\u2019s American Bitcoin Goes Public in Latest Crypto Move by President\u2019s FamilyWhat Happened: Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s bitcoin mining company, American Bitcoin, is going public via a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The Trump sons will retain 98% ownership of the new Nasdaq-listed firm, trading under the ticker \u201cABTC.\u201dWhy It Matters: This deepens the Trump family\u2019s grip on the U.S. crypto sector. As Eric Trump pushes U.S. bitcoin dominance and Trump deregulates the industry, it raises serious red flags about corruption, self-enrichment, and unchecked conflicts of interest.Source: CNBCForeign Investors May Have Won Access to Trump Gala Through Meme Coin ContestWhat Happened: The top 220 holders of Trump\u2019s meme coin secured invitations for a dinner with Trump. Some wallets appear tied to foreign entities, including a Chinese billionaire and Trump ally previously sued by the SEC\u2014a case dropped after Trump took office.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s coin is a pay-to-play access scheme. Foreign investors may be buying influence, while Trump\u2019s family stands to profit tens of millions. National security, ethics, and regulatory integrity are all at risk.Source: ABC NewsElon Musk\u2019s Boring Company in Talks With Government Over Amtrak ProjectWhat Happened: The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting Musk\u2019s Boring Company to potentially take over parts of Amtrak\u2019s $8.5 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel project.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s dual role as Trump adviser and federal contractor poses a major conflict of interest. As he helps gut agencies that oversee his businesses, his companies continue to cash in on federal contracts.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Plan to Accept Luxury Jet From Qatar Strains Bounds of ProprietyWhat Happened: Trump plans to use a $400 million Boeing 747-8 donated by the Qatari royal family as Air Force One\u2014and later transfer it to his private presidential foundation. Attorney General Pam Bondi, a former Qatar lobbyist, approved the deal.Why It Matters: This marks another breakdown of ethics in government. Trump is using the presidency as a tool for personal profit, foreign leverage, and corporate extortion\u2014mirroring Putin\u2019s playbook\u2014while tearing down the very safeguards meant to prevent it.Source: New York TimesLow-Income Families Would Lose, Wealthier Ones Would Gain Under GOP Tax ProposalsWhat Happened: A new Urban Institute analysis finds that extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts while slashing Medicaid and SNAP would hurt low-income families the most. The GOP\u2019s proposed budget includes $880 billion in Medicaid cuts and $230 billion in SNAP reductions, while giving the wealthiest Americans thousands in tax breaks.Why It Matters: This would gut healthcare and food aid for millions to fund tax breaks for the rich\u2014deepening inequality and unraveling the basic safety net for the most vulnerable Americans.Source: USA TodayFCC Threatens Charlie Ergen\u2019s Hold on Satellite, 5G Spectrum LicensesWhat Happened: The FCC is reviewing EchoStar\u2019s use of 5G and satellite spectrum licenses, amid complaints from SpaceX that EchoStar isn\u2019t fully utilizing them. FCC Chair Brendan Carr questioned EchoStar\u2019s compliance and suggested reallocating the spectrum to Starlink.Why It Matters: More corruption as Trump\u2019s FCC is tipping the scales in Musk\u2019s favor\u2014reshaping U.S. telecom policy to reward his political ally and biggest donor.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump Sends Message to World: He\u2019s Open for BusinessWhat Happened: Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, calling it a \u201cgreat gesture\u201d that will later go to his presidential library. The gift violates anti-corruption norms and breaches the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.Why It Matters: Trump is openly dismantling ethical boundaries, turning the presidency into a vehicle for personal gain. With ongoing business ties in Qatar and the UAE, and billions in crypto and legal settlements tied to him, the message is clear: access and influence are for sale.Source: The Wall Street JournalState Department Approves Arms Sales to UAE Before Trump\u2019s VisitWhat Happened: The State Department approved $1.4 billion in arms sales to the United Arab Emirates ahead of Trump\u2019s Middle East tour. The deal includes six CH-47F Chinook helicopters and F-16 parts and maintenance.Why It Matters: This arms deal strengthens ties with the UAE just as Trump faces scrutiny for accepting luxury gifts and expanding personal business ties in the UAE and other Gulf states. Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsAs White House Steers Justice Dept., Bondi Embraces Role of TV MessengerWhat Happened: Trump, through Attorney General Pam Bondi, has turned the Justice Department into a partisan weapon\u2014sidelining legal norms to carry out MAGA-aligned stunts, reward loyalists, and enforce Trump\u2019s personal agenda with total obedience.Why It Matters: The DOJ, once an independent pillar of democracy, now acts as a partisan enforcer. Bondi\u2019s leadership has weaponized the department to punish opponents and protect allies\u2014undermining the rule of law and accelerating the collapse of institutional integrity.Source: New York TimesTop Justice Dept. Official Is Now Also Acting Librarian of CongressWhat Happened: Trump named Deputy AG Todd Blanche\u2014his former personal attorney\u2014as acting Librarian of Congress after abruptly firing Carla Hayden. The White House accused Hayden of promoting \u201cinappropriate\u201d books for children.Why It Matters: This consolidates even more power in Trump loyalists and further politicizes institutions. Installing a top DOJ official to oversee the nation\u2019s largest library signals a purge of independent leadership and an effort to control access to knowledge.Source: New York TimesTrump Installs Top Justice Dept. Official at Library of Congress, Prompting a StandoffWhat Happened: Library of Congress staff blocked access to two DOJ officials whom Blanche tried to install, prompting a standoff and a constitutional clash over control of the legislative branch.Why It Matters: This power grab targets a core congressional institution and threatens the separation of powers, politicizes nonpartisan research, and escalates Trump\u2019s purge of independent leadership.Source: New York Times and WIREDTrump Is Trying to Take Control of Congress Through Its LibraryWhat Happened: Trump is attempting to seize control of the Library of Congress\u2014an agency that provides confidential legal and policy advice to lawmakers\u2014by illegally firing Librarian Carla Hayden and installing Todd Blanche. Staff have temporarily resisted the takeover.Why It Matters: The Library of Congress is not part of the executive branch. Trump\u2019s attempted takeover threatens the independence of Congress by giving his allies potential access to decades of confidential communications and legal analysis from the Congressional Research Service. This is part of a broader strategy by Trump and Musk to seize sensitive institutional data and cripple oversight. Source: Rolling StoneThe hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. governmentWhat Happened: Under Trump and Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, agencies like the EPA, NOAA, and Social Security are being stalled by new spending restrictions\u2014$1 credit card limits, blocked lab purchases, and political appointee approvals on basic contracts. Operations across multiple agencies are grinding to a halt.Why It Matters: By choking off basic operations without formally closing agencies, Trump and Musk are crippling government from within and paving the way to dismantle key institutions.Source: The Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsFBI Ordered to Prioritize Immigration as DOJ Scales Back White Collar CasesWhat Happened: FBI agents have been instructed to spend one-third of their time on immigration enforcement, deprioritizing white-collar crime. Simultaneously, the DOJ issued new guidance narrowing white-collar prosecutions and scaling back corporate monitorships.Why It Matters: Trump is redirecting federal law enforcement to target immigrants instead of prosecuting political and corporate corruption. This shields elites from accountability while weaponizing the system against vulnerable communities\u2014undermining justice.Source: ReutersTrump Officials Investigate California Aid for Undocumented ImmigrantsWhat Happened: DHS has subpoenaed Los Angeles County for records on applicants to California\u2019s Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants, targeting a state-funded aid program for undocumented seniors and disabled individuals. Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s attacks on blue states\u2014weaponizing federal power to punish vulnerable immigrants and undermine state-funded support programs. It\u2019s a targeted effort to intimidate, erode state autonomy, and dismantle social safety nets.Source: New York TimesTrump Poised to Accept \u2018Palace in the Sky\u2019 Jet From QatarWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar\u2019s royal family, via the Pentagon, to use as Air Force One. DOJ memos signed by Pam Bondi claim the gift is legal\u2014despite clear constitutional bans on foreign gifts without congressional approval.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DOJ approved a blatantly unconstitutional gift from a foreign government, reiterating how compromised the DOJ has become. Pam Bondi, who signed off on the deal, previously lobbied for Qatar.Source: ABC NewsTrump Takes Fight With Harvard to University\u2019s Hiring PracticesWhat Happened: The EEOC opened an investigation into Harvard University for alleged \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against white, Asian, male, and heterosexual employees. Citing a drop in white male faculty over the past decade, officials claim there may be a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of illegal hiring bias.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing civil rights law against diversity efforts and attempting to dismantle affirmative action through federal force and reshape education to reflect his extremist political ideology.Source: The Wall Street JournalSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Complains the Media Won\u2019t Obey\u2014But Many Already AreWhat Happened: Trump continues attacking the press as \u201cradical-left\u201d and \u201cfake news,\u201d even as media executives cave to his influence. Billionaire owners at outlets like The Washington Post, CBS, and ABC have reportedly restructured editorial boards or settled lawsuits to avoid conflict with Trump.Why It Matters: This erosion of press independence signals a dangerous shift. As media moguls bow to Trump to protect profits or avoid retaliation, critical coverage is chilled and self-censorship rises\u2014undermining one of democracy\u2019s most essential safeguards: a free and independent press.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News\u201cThe Children Are Being Used as Bait\u201dWhat Happened: New Trump policies are trapping migrant children in custody by making it nearly impossible for undocumented sponsors, including parents, to reunite with them. ICE now has access to ORR data and joins welfare checks, creating fear among potential sponsors. Meanwhile, legal aid funding has been slashed, forcing children as young as 4 to appear in immigration court alone.Why It Matters: This regime is using children as bait to target immigrant families while stripping them of legal protections. It\u2019s a deliberate, reprehensible strategy to instill fear, block reunifications, and accelerate deportations without due process.Source: Mother JonesDHS to End Deportation Protections for AfghanistanWhat Happened: Kristi Noem announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Afghans in the U.S., effective July 12. The Biden-era protections were granted after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. DHS claims conditions have \u201cnotably improved\u201d under the Taliban.Why It Matters: Over 9,000 Afghans\u2014many of whom risked their lives for U.S. forces\u2014now face deportation to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where they risk imprisonment or death. It\u2019s a cruel betrayal with deadly consequences.Source: The Washington PostGeorgia college student remains in ICE custody after mistaken traffic stopWhat Happened: Ximena Arias-Cristobal, a 19-year-old undocumented college student, was wrongly pulled over in Dalton, Georgia. Charges were dropped after dash cam footage cleared her\u2014but she remains in ICE custody and faces deportation.Why It Matters: Despite being cleared, Arias-Cristobal is now caught in Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet. She\u2019s lived in the U.S. since age 4. Her father was also detained after a separate minor traffic stop.Source: ABC NewsPentagon Halts Gender-Affirming Care for Trans TroopsWhat Happened: The Pentagon has blocked all new hormone treatments and surgeries for transgender troops as part of Trump\u2019s plan to remove them from the military.Why It Matters: This strips thousands of transgender service members of vital medical care and reflects a broader rollback of LGBTQ+ rights\u2014undermining dignity, equality, and military inclusion.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchRepublicans Target Federal Anti-Hunger Program as They Prepare Trump Tax PackageWhat Happened: House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions to SNAP, including stricter work requirements, limiting aid to citizens and green card holders, and requiring states to co-fund the program\u2014measures aimed at offsetting Trump\u2019s costly tax cuts for the wealthy.Why It Matters: Millions of low-income families will lose food assistance under this plan. Republicans want to gut a critical anti-hunger program to finance tax breaks for the wealthy while deepening poverty.Source: New York TimesNewark Airport Had 3 Controllers on Duty When the Goal Is 14What Happened: Severe air traffic controller shortages at Newark Airport led to flight delays of up to seven hours. Only 1 to 3 fully certified controllers were working instead of the required 14, forcing the FAA to hold incoming flights across the U.S. and Canada.Why It Matters: Newark, a major U.S. airport, is now a symbol of nationwide aviation breakdowns. Staffing shortfalls, purges, tech failures, and poor planning have created dangerous delays and growing risks for passengers.Source: New York TimesNursing Home and Elder-Care Residents Could Be Hit Hard by Potential Medicaid CutsWhat Happened: House Republicans are pushing a proposal to limit a key Medicaid funding mechanism known as the \u201cprovider tax,\u201d which helps states finance long-term care through federal matching funds. The change could drastically reduce Medicaid support for nursing homes.Why It Matters: Over 60% of nursing home stays are funded by Medicaid. Slashing this funding threatens care for hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled Americans. Facilities may cut beds or close entirely, leaving vulnerable residents without essential support.Source: The Washington PostEPA to Dismantle Chemical Health Risk ProgramWhat Happened: Trump is gutting the EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development, threatening the future of IRIS\u2014the agency\u2019s key program for studying chemical health risks. Staff were told to reapply for fewer roles, and the program\u2019s leader recently stepped down.Why It Matters: IRIS has long been a target of the chemical industry because its independent research supports environmental protections. Gutting it will cripple the EPA\u2019s ability to assess toxic chemicals\u2014handing a major win to polluters and endangering public health.Source: WIRED\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHands Off Greenland, Ex-NATO Chief Defies TrumpWhat Happened: Former Danish PM and NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned Trump\u2019s renewed threats to seize Greenland, calling them \u201cshameless.\u201d Trump stated he wouldn\u2019t rule out illegally using force, saying the U.S. \u201cneeds Greenland very badly\u201d for \u201csecurity reasons.\u201dWhy It Matters: Denmark is alarmed by U.S. surveillance of Greenland and summoned the ambassador in protest. Trump\u2019s proposed \u201cCompact of Free Association\u201d signals an attempt to seize control against the will of Greenland\u2019s people, mirroring Putin, not a democratic ally.Source: PoliticoPoland to Shut Second Russian Consulate Over Sabotage ClaimsWhat Happened: Poland ordered the closure of Russia\u2019s consulate in Krakow, citing evidence that Moscow\u2019s secret services orchestrated a massive fire at a Warsaw shopping mall in 2024. This follows an earlier consulate closure in Poznan over similar sabotage concerns.Why It Matters: Poland\u2019s shutdown of another Russian consulate underscores how Moscow exploits diplomatic cover to plan sabotage and terror. As hybrid attacks and election interference escalate, NATO\u2019s eastern flank is drawing a hard line\u2014signaling zero tolerance for Russian covert warfare.Source: BloombergEuropean Officials Pledge Support for Ukraine, New Russia Sanctions at London SummitWhat Happened: At a May 12 summit, top European powers backed Ukraine with new military and economic pledges. They demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia and warned of new sanctions targeting Kremlin oil profits and frozen assets. Zelenskyy confirmed he\u2019ll attend May 15 talks in Turkey, even without Putin.Why It Matters: As Trump retreats from Ukraine, Europe is stepping up. The expanded Weimar+ group marks a united front to counter Putin\u2014through sanctions, military aid, and a clear commitment to NATO. Europe is filling the void left by the U.S.Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Responds to Ceasefire Call With Drone StrikesWhat Happened: After Ukraine and its allies called for a 30-day ceasefire, Russia launched over 100 drones at Ukraine, killing at least two and injuring seven. Putin rejected the \u201cceasefire,\u201d using upcoming talks in Istanbul as a stalling tactic, again, while continuing attacks.Why It Matters: Trump is pressuring Ukraine to negotiate, and Zelenskyy has agreed\u2014daring Putin to show up. But Russia\u2019s continued strikes reiterate it\u2019s not serious about ending its illegal invasion. This is another delay tactic to prolong its genocidal war against Ukraine.Source: PoliticoTrump Envoy Relied on Kremlin Interpreter in Secret Putin TalksWhat Happened: Steve Witkoff met with Putin three times without a U.S. interpreter\u2014relying instead on Kremlin translators, which left Witkoff vulnerable to manipulation. There was no official transcript created by U.S. officials.Why It Matters: Using Kremlin interpreters gave Putin the upper hand and left the U.S. in the dark. With no American record and no national security staff present, these secretive meetings were most likely about arranging private business deals with Moscow.Source: NBC NewsRama Trounces MAGA-Linked Opponents to Win 4th Term in AlbaniaWhat Happened: Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama secured a historic fourth term, with his party winning around 82 seats in Albania\u2019s 140-seat parliament. He made EU accession by 2030 a central campaign pledge.Why It Matters: Rama mocked his opponents for hiring Trump campaign chief Chris LaCivita, saying, \u201cHiring a Hollywood hairdresser doesn\u2019t make you Brad Pitt.\u201d His victory strengthens Albania\u2019s pro-EU path and precedes a major European summit in Tirana this week.Source: Politico\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTariff Truce With China Demonstrates the Limits of Trump\u2019s AggressionWhat Happened: After imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump was forced to roll them back amid economic fallout and backlash from U.S. businesses. A deal reached in Geneva lowers mutual tariffs but yields no major concessions from China beyond continued talks.Why It Matters: The retreat highlights Trump\u2019s failure to strong-arm Beijing through economic warfare. His trade escalation hurt American companies, disrupted global supply chains, and ultimately exposed the limits of his combative strategy when China didn\u2019t fold.Source: New York TimesAmerica Has Given China a Strangely Good Tariff DealWhat Happened: Trump sharply reduced his extreme tariffs on Chinese goods\u2014from 145% to 30%\u2014in a temporary 90-day truce, while China lowered its duties from 125% to 10%. The deal followed weeks of economic disruption and pressure from U.S. businesses.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s aggressive posture, the deal delivers few wins for the U.S. and major relief for Beijing. China made no new concessions, while the U.S. retreated from a trade war it couldn\u2019t sustain\u2014exposing the strategic weakness behind Trump\u2019s economic brinkmanship.Source: The Economist\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Avelo Airlines Faces Backlash for Aiding Trump\u2019s Deportation CampaignWhat Happened: Avelo Airlines has begun operating deportation flights for ICE under a new contract, despite serving mostly liberal-leaning cities.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Trump is auctioning off presidential access through crypto \u2014 His $TRUMP coin gala sets a dangerous precedent where influence can be bought by anonymous and foreign investors.Institutional Collapse by Design \u2014 Musk is choking off basic government operations, creating a shutdown that dismantles public services.Weaponized Justice \u2014 Pam Bondi\u2019s DOJ acts as a partisan tool, shielding Trump allies, punishing enemies, and abandoning oversight of elite corruption.Putin-Style Power Grabs \u2014 From seizing the Library of Congress to pushing foreign influence deals, Trump is systematically dismantling democracy for personal gain and unchecked power.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 12</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his

The top 25 will get VIP access and a White House tour.

The Trump sons will retain 98% ownership of the new Nasdaq-listed firm, trading under the ticker \\u201CABTC.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This deepens the Trump family\\u2019s grip on the U.S. crypto sector. As Eric Trump pushes U.S. bitcoin dominance and Trump deregulates the industry, it raises serious red flags about corruption, self-enrichment, and unchecked conflicts of interest.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/eric-trump-american-bitcoin-public.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Foreign Investors May Have Won Access to Trump Gala Through Meme Coin Contest</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The top 220 holders of Trump\\u2019s meme coin secured invitations for a dinner with Trump. Some wallets appear tied to foreign entities, including a Chinese billionaire and Trump ally previously sued by the SEC\\u2014a case dropped after Trump took office.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s coin is a pay-to-play access scheme.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, a former Qatar lobbyist, approved the deal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks another breakdown of ethics in government.

The GOP\\u2019s proposed budget includes $880 billion in Medicaid cuts and $230 billion in SNAP reductions, while giving the wealthiest Americans thousands in tax breaks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would gut healthcare and food aid for millions to fund tax breaks for the rich\\u2014deepening inequality and unraveling the basic safety net for the most vulnerable Americans.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/12/gop-tax-proposals-cost-poor-help-wealthy/83583573007/\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>FCC Threatens Charlie Ergen\\u2019s Hold on Satellite, 5G Spectrum Licenses</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FCC is reviewing EchoStar\\u2019s use of 5G and satellite spectrum licenses, amid complaints from SpaceX that EchoStar isn\\u2019t fully utilizing them. FCC Chair Brendan Carr questioned EchoStar\\u2019s compliance and suggested reallocating the spectrum to Starlink.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More corruption as Trump\\u2019s FCC is tipping the scales in Musk\\u2019s favor\\u2014reshaping U.S. telecom policy to reward his political ally and biggest donor.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/business/telecom/fcc-threatens-charlie-ergens-hold-on-satellite-5g-spectrum-licenses-e2913889?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos2\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Sends Message to World: He\\u2019s Open for Business</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, calling it a \\u201Cgreat gesture\\u201D that will later go to his presidential library. The gift violates anti-corruption norms and breaches the Constitution\\u2019s emoluments clause.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly dismantling ethical boundaries, turning the presidency into a vehicle for personal gain. With ongoing business ties in Qatar and the UAE, and billions in crypto and legal settlements tied to him, the message is clear: access and influence are for sale.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-defends-gift-of-plane-from-qatar-6ab522f8?mod=hp_lead_pos6\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>State Department Approves Arms Sales to UAE Before Trump\\u2019s Visit</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The State Department approved $1.4 billion in arms sales to the United Arab Emirates ahead of Trump\\u2019s Middle East tour. The deal includes six CH-47F Chinook helicopters and F-16 parts and maintenance.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This arms deal strengthens ties with the UAE just as Trump faces scrutiny for accepting luxury gifts and expanding personal business ties in the UAE and other Gulf states. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-12/state-department-approves-arms-sales-to-uae-before-trump-s-visit?srnd=phx-us-politics\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>As White House Steers Justice Dept., Bondi Embraces Role of TV Messenger</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump, through Attorney General Pam Bondi, has turned the Justice Department into a partisan weapon\\u2014sidelining legal norms to carry out MAGA-aligned stunts, reward loyalists, and enforce Trump\\u2019s personal agenda with total obedience.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The DOJ, once an independent pillar of democracy, now acts as a partisan enforcer.

The White House accused Hayden of promoting \\u201Cinappropriate\\u201D books for children.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This consolidates even more power in Trump loyalists and further politicizes institutions. Installing a top DOJ official to oversee the nation\\u2019s largest library signals a purge of independent leadership and an effort to control access to knowledge.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-blanche-attorney-general-librarian-congress.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Installs Top Justice Dept.

Staff have temporarily resisted the takeover.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Library of Congress is not part of the executive branch. Trump\\u2019s attempted takeover threatens the independence of Congress by giving his allies potential access to decades of confidential communications and legal analysis from the Congressional Research Service. This is part of a broader strategy by Trump and Musk to seize sensitive institutional data and cripple oversight. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-library-of-congress-take-over-legislative-branch-1235337425/\\\\\\\">Rolling Stone</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>The hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. government</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Under Trump and Musk\\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, agencies like the EPA, NOAA, and Social Security are being stalled by new spending restrictions\\u2014$1 credit card limits, blocked lab purchases, and political appointee approvals on basic contracts. Operations across multiple agencies are grinding to a halt.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By choking off basic operations without formally closing agencies, Trump and Musk are crippling government from within and paving the way to dismantle key institutions.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/11/trump-government-operations-halt-funding-cuts/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>FBI Ordered to Prioritize Immigration as DOJ Scales Back White Collar Cases</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FBI agents have been instructed to spend one-third of their time on immigration enforcement, deprioritizing white-collar crime. Simultaneously, the DOJ issued new guidance narrowing white-collar prosecutions and scaling back corporate monitorships.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is redirecting federal law enforcement to target immigrants instead of prosecuting political and corporate corruption.

DOJ memos signed by Pam Bondi claim the gift is legal\\u2014despite clear constitutional bans on foreign gifts without congressional approval.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s DOJ approved a blatantly unconstitutional gift from a foreign government, reiterating how compromised the DOJ has become.
