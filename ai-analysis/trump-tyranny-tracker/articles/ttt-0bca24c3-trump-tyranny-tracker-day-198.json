This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=header \ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsCompany advised by Trump sons said it hoped to benefit from fed money, then took it backWhat Happened: A new SPAC advised by Eric and Donald Trump Jr. initially told investors it sought to profit from federal grants and tax credits under their father\u2019s presidency. After AP inquiries, the filing was hastily revised to remove the language, though no pledge was made to avoid using government funds.Why It Matters: This is blatant corruption and more Trump-family self-dealing \u2014 using public office as a personal profit center. Even when exposed, they simply rewrite the paperwork while leaving every opportunity to cash in on federal programs.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Airs Personal Financial Grievances Ahead of \u2018Debanking\u2019 CrackdownWhat Happened: Trump accused JPMorgan and Bank of America of discriminating against him by rejecting over $1 billion in Trump Organization deposits after his first term. The claims come as his regime readies executive action to punish banks over alleged \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in account closures.Why It Matters: Trump is using his presidency to settle personal financial scores, weaponizing executive power against Wall Street. His vendetta would reshape financial regulations and further politicize banking practices.Source: New York TimesTrump Fires Most of Puerto Rico Oversight BoardWhat Happened: Trump abruptly purged five of seven members of Puerto Rico\u2019s federally appointed fiscal oversight board, which was created to manage the island\u2019s bankruptcy and financial restructuring. No reason was given for the terminations, which took immediate effect.Why It Matters: This fuels political instability in Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile recovery and lets Trump stack the board with pro\u2013hedge fund allies. It tilts power toward bondholders at the expense of residents still struggling with poverty, blackouts, and disaster recovery.Source: Wall Street Journal\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsHouse Oversight Committee subpoenas Justice Department for Epstein files, high-profile former officials for depositionsWhat Happened: The GOP-led House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to the Justice Department and ten former high-profile officials\u2014including Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, James Comey, Robert Mueller, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton\u2014demanding Epstein-related files and depositions. Why It Matters: This is a politicized sham. Congress is shielding Trump by ignoring his direct ties and omitting his former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, his lawyer Todd Blanche, and others, while pretending to seek justice in a horrific sex trafficking ring involving the rape of over 1,000 childrenSource: CNNOfficials Move to Open Inquiry on Trump\u2019s \u2018Russia Hoax\u2019 GrievanceWhat Happened: Pam Bondi authorized a grand jury probe into officials who investigated Russia\u2019s 2016 election attack, acting on Trump\u2019s calls for retribution. Launched in Florida despite shaky jurisdiction, the inquiry positions Trump to pursue prosecutions of his perceived enemies.Why It Matters: Trump continues escalating his political vengeance agenda. With no viable charges and statutes of limitations long expired, it\u2019s a spectacle to punish opponents and deflect from Trump\u2019s own scandals \u2014 a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: New York TimesICE Is About To Go on a Social Media and TV Ad Recruiting BlitzWhat Happened: ICE is preparing a nationwide digital and streaming ad campaign, targeting Gen Z on platforms like Hulu and HBO Max, to recruit over 14,000 additional personnel. The hiring push follows a massive budget increase and ICE\u2019s construction of migrant internment camps.Why It Matters: Trump is rapidly expanding ICE into a paramilitary force for mass deportations. Recruiting younger Americans through media saturation points to a long-term plan to cement authoritarian immigration enforcement and build a broader police state.Source: 404 MediaJustice Department publishes list of 35 \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, vowing to bring more immigration lawsuitsWhat Happened: The Justice Department released a list of 35 \u201csanctuary\u201d states, counties, and cities \u2014 including California, New York, and Washington \u2014 and vowed to sue those limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The move follows Trump\u2019s April order directing legal action to bring these jurisdictions into compliance.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DOJ is intensifying its war on immigrant communities, threatening legal punishment for protecting residents. It\u2019s a coercive push to turn state and local governments into enforcers of federal immigration policy.Source: CBS NewsVictims object to \u2018public legitimization\u2019 of Ghislaine Maxwell as judge weighs fate of Epstein grand jury transcriptsWhat Happened: Victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell objected to her \u201cpublic legitimization\u201d as a judge considers unsealing grand jury transcripts. Their lawyers condemned Maxwell\u2019s prison downgrade to Club Med, private DOJ meetings, and possible clemency talks, accusing Trump of retraumatizing survivors by moving to unseal without consulting them.Why It Matters: The DOJ is paving the way for Maxwell\u2019s leniency while sidelining victims and whitewashing a horrific sex trafficker. Survivors fear their hard-won justice is being sacrificed for political theater.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsColumbia and Brown to Disclose Admissions and Race Data in Trump DealWhat Happened: Under federal settlements, Columbia and Brown will give Trump officials detailed admissions data, including applicants\u2019 test scores, GPAs, and race. The move is intended to enforce a stricter reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ban and push schools toward \u201cmerit-only\u201d admissions.Why It Matters: This sweeping data grab will chill diversity efforts and arm conservative groups to attack race-conscious policies and surveil individuals. It\u2019s a major step in Trump\u2019s drive to reshape higher education, cut minority representation in elite schools, and enforce ideological conformity.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsInside Trump\u2019s New Tactic to Separate Immigrant FamiliesWhat Happened: ICE is separating children from asylum-seeking parents who refuse deportation. At least nine families have been split under this new tactic, with kids sent to shelters while parents remain in detention.Why It Matters: This is a return of Trump\u2019s family reprehensible separation policy\u2014now used as leverage against immigrants already inside the U.S. It inflicts trauma to force compliance and evade legal limits on deportation.Source: New York TimesUS citizens jailed in LA Ice raids speak out: \u2018They came ready to attack\u2019What Happened: ICE officers in Los Angeles violently arrested multiple U.S. citizens \u2014 including Andrea Velez and Adrian Martinez \u2014 during plainclothes raids using unmarked vehicles, assault rifles, and fabricated charges. Velez was jailed and falsely accused of assault before charges were dropped; Martinez was beaten, jailed, and smeared by ICE and the DOJ despite video showing no assault and no formal charges filed.Why It Matters: ICE is abducting citizens in broad daylight and falsifying charges to cover it up. These raids mirror authoritarian policing \u2014 masked men, no IDs, secret jails \u2014 leaving innocent people brutalized, prosecuted, and living in fear in their own country.Source: The GuardianICE Offers, Then Quickly Withdraws, Cash Bonuses for Swiftly Deporting ImmigrantsWhat Happened: ICE briefly rolled out a pilot program offering $100\u2013$200 bonuses for agents who deported immigrants within two weeks of arrest. The plan was scrapped within hours after media inquiries but revealed internal pressure to hit Trump\u2019s aggressive mass deportation targets.Why It Matters: The scheme shows how far Trump is pushing to speed removals, ignoring due process and human rights violations. It will only get worse with ICE\u2019s budget tripled and fast-track deportations surging.Source: New York TimesHe Fled Boko Haram and Helped Build an Award-Winning Restaurant. Now He\u2019s Facing Deportation.What Happened: Paul Dama, a Nigerian asylum seeker and manager at Boston\u2019s acclaimed Suya Joint, was detained by ICE on Father\u2019s Day despite having valid work authorization through 2029. Dama fled Boko Haram after being kidnapped for his journalism and had become a pillar in his community\u2014until immigration officials claimed he violated visa terms and targeted him for removal.Why It Matters: Dama\u2019s case shows how Trump\u2019s immigration regime is detaining asylum seekers who pose no public threat. His detention echoes his trauma and exposes the cruelty of a system weaponized for political ends.Source: Mother JonesThe Trump Administration Is Promoting Its Anti-Trans Agenda Globally at the United NationsWhat Happened: U.S. delegates under Trump have repeatedly objected to the word \u201cgender\u201d in U.N. documents, calling it a threat to \u201cbiological truth\u201d and insisting it be replaced with language recognizing only male and female sexes. The regime is using global forums on pollution, health, and human rights to export its anti-trans ideology and align with authoritarian regimes opposing LGBTQ+ rights.Why It Matters: The U.S. is undermining international human rights norms and signaling that trans, nonbinary, and intersex identities are expendable. Trump\u2019s war on \u201cgender ideology\u201d has become a global crusade \u2014 with deadly consequences.Source: ProPublicaRwanda Agrees to Accept 250 Migrants as Part of Trump Deportation PlanWhat Happened: Rwanda agreed to take in 250 deportees under Trump\u2019s expanding effort to offload migrants held in U.S. custody. The deal, which follows a $100,000 payment for a similar transfer earlier this year, includes resettlement support and gives Rwanda discretion over who it accepts.Why It Matters: Trump is outsourcing immigration enforcement to authoritarian states with documented human rights abuses. It raises serious ethical and legal concerns about dumping vulnerable migrants in countries with no rights protections.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Administration Illegally Withheld N.I.H. Funding, Watchdog FindsWhat Happened: A federal watchdog found Trump broke the law by halting $8 billion in NIH grants and canceling over 1,800 research awards from February to June. The GAO said Trump unlawfully withheld congressionally approved funds, disrupting cancer and disease research nationwide.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s fifth impoundment violation, showing his pattern of defying Congress and courts to control federal spending. Cutting lifesaving medical research funding puts public health at risk.Source: New York TimesCovid cases rising in US as officials plan to restrict booster vaccinesWhat Happened: Covid cases are rising in 26 states as Trump officials move to restrict access to updated booster shots. New guidance limits eligibility to older adults and people with pre-existing conditions, dropping recommendations for children and pregnant people despite proven benefits.Why It Matters: Trump is sidelining science for political optics, slashing vaccine access as dangerous variants spread. The result is more illness, preventable hospitalizations, and confusion \u2014 putting millions at risk as public immunity wanes.Source: The GuardianRFK Jr. pulls $500 million in funding for vaccine developmentWhat Happened: RFK Jr. canceled 22 mRNA vaccine projects, cutting $500 million in funding for COVID-19, flu, and H5N1 shot development. The move halts work by major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna.Why It Matters: By attacking mRNA technology that saved millions, RFK Jr. is steering U.S. health policy toward unproven alternatives and conspiracy-driven thinking, undermining preparedness for future outbreaks.Source: Associated PressYour call to a local Social Security office may be picked up by someone who can't helpWhat Happened: To reduce phone wait times, the Social Security Administration is now rerouting calls from local offices to other offices nationwide. But staff say they often lack jurisdiction to resolve issues, creating delays and confusion for people seeking help with disability and retirement claims.Why It Matters: The policy is wasting time, sowing distrust in the system, and making it harder\u2014especially for vulnerable claimants\u2014to access essential services. And SSA employees admit they\u2019re in the dark about how long the chaos will last.Source: NPR\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchBolsonaro House Arrest Casts Shadow Over Brazil-U.S. Trade TalksWhat Happened: Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court placed former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest on coup-plot charges, drawing U.S. condemnation and threats from Trump. The move comes as 50% U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods are set to take effect this week, heightening tensions.Why It Matters: Trump is linking U.S. trade policy to defending Bolsonaro\u2014an insurrectionist, straining relations with Brazil, and pressuring its judiciary. The standoff risks the disruption of commerce and undermines democratic norms.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Staffing Gaps Complicate India\u2019s Bid to Ease US TensionsWhat Happened: India is struggling to engage with the U.S. as key diplomatic posts remain unfilled under Trump, including the Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs and the U.S. Ambassador to India. The vacancies come as Trump imposes a 25% tariff and threatens more over India\u2019s Russian oil purchases.Why It Matters: With the National Security Council gutted and senior posts vacant, U.S. foreign policy is paralyzed. Trump\u2019s personnel vacuum is weakening alliances, destabilizing partnerships, and fueling a diplomatic crisis with India.Source: BloombergLithuania Requests NATO Help Boost Its Air Defenses After Second Drone Crosses BorderWhat Happened: Lithuania formally asked NATO to deploy more air defense resources, including experimental systems, after a Russian drone from Belarus crashed in a military training zone. It\u2019s the second such incident in July, with officials warning the incursions will likely continue as Russia escalates air attacks on Ukraine.Why It Matters: Repeated drone breaches threaten NATO\u2019s eastern flank and risk sparking wider conflict. Lithuania\u2019s urgent request underscores growing fears of war spillover and the need for NATO to adapt quickly, as Russia continues probing and testing allied defenses.Source: Politico\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia says it no longer will abide by its self-imposed moratorium on intermediate-range missilesWhat Happened: Russia said it will no longer honor its moratorium on deploying nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles, citing U.S. plans to place similar weapons in Germany. Moscow framed the move as a response to \u201cdirect threats\u201d from NATO and missile deployments near its borders.Source: Associated PressNY Times reported John Durham found the \u201cClinton Plan\u201d emails were likely created by Russian spies. Right-wing media are running with them as legitimate.What Happened: A newly declassified annex to John Durham\u2019s Russia probe shows \u201cClinton Plan\u201d emails were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence. Right-wing media are pushing them as \u201cproof\u201d Clinton tried to frame Trump, calling it a \u201csoft coup\u201d and demanding prosecutions.Why It Matters: The emails were deemed not credible and probably manufactured, but conservative outlets are weaponizing them to revive debunked scandals, distract from Trump\u2019s Russia ties and Epstein fallout, and lay the groundwork for prosecutions of opposition.Source: Media MattersBannon Pushes EJ Antoni for BLS, Wants \u2018MAGA Republican\u2019 in RoleWhat Happened: Steve Bannon is pushing Heritage Foundation economist EJ Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump fired commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Antoni, a Project 2025 co-author, is advocating a major overhaul of BLS operations in line with Trump\u2019s effort to staff agencies with subservients.Why It Matters: Trump continues turning federal data agencies into partisan tools, threatening the integrity of core economic statistics. Installing a \u201cMAGA Republican\u201d at BLS will politicize labor data that guides markets, policy, and public trust.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsU.S. Imports Slid in June on Higher TariffsWhat Happened: U.S. imports dropped nearly 4% in June as Trump\u2019s steep tariffs pushed businesses to scale back orders. Export levels also dipped slightly, and the overall trade deficit narrowed to $60.2 billion amid economic uncertainty.Why It Matters: Trump's erratic tariff policy is destabilizing trade, weakening business confidence, and threatening long-term growth. With more tariffs set to hit, experts warn U.S. firms could lose global competitiveness.Source: New York TimesUS services activity flatlined in July, ISM data showsWhat Happened: U.S. services sector growth stalled in July as the ISM nonmanufacturing index dipped to 50.1\u2014just above contraction. Businesses are reeling from Trump's sweeping tariffs, which now average 18.3%, the highest since 1934.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff blitz is choking the backbone of the U.S. economy. Services\u2014making up two-thirds of GDP\u2014are stagnating, and costs are spiking.Source: ReutersTrump firing of statistics chief puts US data credibility at risk, experts warnWhat Happened: Trump abruptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after accusing her, without evidence, of \u201cfalsifying\u201d job numbers that showed weaker economic growth. Experts warn the move undermines trust in U.S. economic data and echoes tactics used by authoritarian regimes, where governments manipulate statistics for political gain.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on data integrity. Replacing career experts with loyalists could turn trusted federal stats into propaganda, threatening economic stability and global credibility.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501California Democrats Look to Redraw House Map to Counter Texas G.O.P.What Happened: California Democrats are preparing to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map to flip up to five Republican-held House seats, countering Texas Republicans\u2019 effort to create five new GOP seats. The move escalates a coast-to-coast redistricting battle as Trump allies push aggressive gerrymanders ahead of the 2026 midterms.Source: New York TimesJudge Blocks Trump Move to Kill FEMA Disaster Mitigation FundWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s effort to shut down FEMA\u2019s $4 billion disaster mitigation program, BRIC, which funds climate-related protections like flood control and wildfire management. The ruling came after 20 states sued to stop the diversion of funds.Source: New York TimesSpike Lee, Adam McKay and over 2,000 writers decry Trump\u2019s \u2018un-American\u2019 actions in open letterWhat Happened: More than 2,300 screenwriters, including Spike Lee, Adam McKay, and David Simon, signed an open letter condemning Trump\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian assault\u201d on free speech. The Writers Guild letter slams Trump\u2019s lawsuits against media, payoffs from broadcasters, pressure campaigns on public institutions, and FCC interference in the CBS-Paramount merger to skew media ideologically.Source: The GuardianFirst-of-a-kind US class-action lawsuit would force EPA to reinstate $3bn climate programWhat Happened: A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the EPA and its head Lee Zeldin, for terminating the $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice program, created by Congress to help disadvantaged communities prepare for climate disasters.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Trump\u2019s Immigration Machine \u2014 The expansion of ICE into a militarized, Gen Z-targeted enforcement force is part of his blueprint for a permanent police state, extending authoritarian control far beyond immigration and across American life.Trump\u2019s Retaliation Politics \u2014 From firing oversight boards to targeting states and cities, Trump is turning governance into a weapon for personal vendettas and ideological expansion.Trump\u2019s Attack on Science and Public Health \u2014 From killing mRNA research to restricting vaccines, his policies are dismantling U.S. readiness for current and future health crises.Trump\u2019s Erosion of Data Integrity \u2014 Purging career experts and replacing them with partisan loyalists threatens the accuracy of federal statistics that guide policy and markets.Trump\u2019s Foreign Authoritarian Alignment \u2014 From defending insurrectionist Bolsonaro to echoing Putin, Trump\u2019s foreign policy increasingly mirrors and protects anti-democratic thugs abroad.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

The regime is using global forums on pollution, health, and human rights to export its anti-trans ideology and align with authoritarian regimes opposing LGBTQ+ rights.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The U.S. is undermining international human rights norms and signaling that trans, nonbinary, and intersex identities are expendable.
