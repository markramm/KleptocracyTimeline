This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers.

The probe, which predated Trump\u2019s return to power, examined Musk\u2019s frequent contacts with individuals from Eastern Europe and beyond, raising alarms given his access to classified information and sensitive government contracts.Why It Matters: Musk injected $280 million into Trump\u2019s campaign, turned Twitter into a weapon for disinformation, and maintained contact with Putin. Intelligence officials clearly worried he may become compromised. It would be interesting to know who else bankrolled Trump\u2019s return, and whether Musk was a backdoor for foreign influence and access to U.S. secrets.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Keeps Starlink at White House Despite Musk FeudWhat Happened: Trump said he will continue using Starlink at the White House even after a public falling out with Musk. While Trump hinted he might remove his personal Tesla, he praised Starlink as a \u201cgood service\u201d and brushed off their dispute, calling Musk a former ally and wishing him well.Why It Matters: Keeping Starlink\u2014a private satellite network\u2014embedded in White House operations is a national security risk, and creates a foreign-targeted backchannel to U.S. communications and intelligence. Trump\u2019s reliance on Musk\u2019s tech shows how critical infrastructure is being privatized and politicized, placing the U.S. in the hands of one erratic billionaire.Source: CNBCLawmakers Traded Stocks Heavily as Trump Rolled Out \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 TariffsWhat Happened: While Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs sent markets plunging, members of Congress and their families made over 700 stock trades in just one week. Some lawmakers bought low and profited when Trump paused the tariffs days later, triggering a market rebound.Why It Matters: This is textbook corruption. While Americans panicked over their savings, lawmakers exploited inside information to profit off Trump-induced chaos.

Senior officials must now hire only those aligned with Trump\u2019s agenda, and even \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats are approved at work.Why It Matters: Trump continues replacing nonpartisan public servants with loyalists, turning the U.S. government into a personal political machine. This is a massive step toward the consolidation of power and authoritarian control.Source: New York TimesLA Mayor: City Is Trump\u2019s 'Test Case' for Federal TakeoverWhat Happened: Mayor Karen Bass accused Trump of using Los Angeles as \u201can experiment\u201d in federal overreach, saying Marines and ICE raids have created chaos where none existed. She noted the National Guard was deployed before unrest even began and warned the federal takeover strips local authorities of control.Why It Matters: Trump is using LA to test police state tactics\u2014removing local power, deploying military force, and terrifying legal residents. Bass warned that it\u2019s creating fear, distrust, and driving immigrants underground, even those with legal status.Source: The GuardianTrump Tells Troops: \u2018We Will Liberate Los Angeles\u2019What Happened: In a politicized, insane speech at Fort Bragg, Trump defended deploying troops to Los Angeles, calling immigration protests a \u201cforeign assault\u201d on U.S. sovereignty. He warned of using \u201cvery big force\u201d at future demonstrations and vowed to \u201cliberate\u201d the city\u2014language reserved for war zones abroad.Why It Matters: Trump is militarizing domestic politics, using the language of warfare to justify cracking down on dissent. By casting U.S. cities as enemy territory, he\u2019s normalizing military force as a tool of political control.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump More Than Doubles Federal Deployments to Los AngelesWhat Happened: Trump deployed 700 active-duty Marines and 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles (bringing the total to 4,000)\u2014despite the city being largely peaceful. The move comes without the formal invocation of the Insurrection Act and over Governor Newsom\u2019s objections.Why It Matters: This is another abuse of federal power. Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement protests and using federal troops as political theater, testing the limits of Posse Comitatus and accelerating the collapse of civilian control.Source: New York TimesLeaked Letter: Noem Sought Military Arrests, Drones for LA ProtestsWhat Happened: Kristi Noem urged Pete Hegseth to let the military arrest protesters, deploy drones, and deliver munitions to Los Angeles. The letter, sent before Marines were deployed, suggested protesters were aiding \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d Legal experts warned it was a clear move toward invoking the Insurrection Act.Why It Matters: This marks a major escalation\u2014treating domestic protests as acts of war and using military force to suppress dissent. Noem\u2019s framing blurs the line between protest and terrorism, laying the groundwork for mass repression under the guise of national security. A classic tactic used in Russia.Source: San Francisco ChronicleICE\u2019s tactics draw criticism as it triples daily arrest targetsWhat Happened: ICE has ramped up immigration raids to meet a new target of 3,000 daily arrests\u2014triple the previous quota. The change, pushed by Trump aide Stephen Miller, has led to indiscriminate sweeps at restaurants, stores, schools, playgrounds, and courthouses.Why It Matters: ICE is targeting non-criminal immigrants\u2014arresting people at check-ins, separating mothers from their children, and spreading fear across communities. It\u2019s a campaign of cruelty that shreds due process and breaks families apart.Source: ReutersUS Justice Department 'weaponization' reviews spark calls to drop prosecutionsWhat Happened: The Justice Department formed a \u201cWeaponization Working Group\u201d to review\u2014and in some cases reverse\u2014corruption and tax prosecutions it claims were politically biased. The unit is reexamining cases tied to Trump donors and allies, including a former Tennessee speaker, a Navy admiral, and a billionaire banker, with some convictions already overturned or pardoned.Why It Matters: Trump has converted the DOJ into a shield for loyalists\u2014rewriting corruption as persecution and rewriting justice as revenge. This purge of accountability mirrors Russia, where political loyalty trumps the law and prosecution is weaponized only against enemies.Source: ReutersRep. LaMonica McIver indicted on federal charges over clash with law enforcement at ICE facility in New JerseyWhat Happened: Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) was indicted on federal charges for allegedly \u201cinterfering\u201d with ICE agents during a protest and oversight visit at a Newark detention center. Prosecutors claim she \u201cassaulted\u201d officers while trying to shield Newark Mayor Ras Baraka from arrest.Why It Matters: More political retaliation. Trump ally Alina Habba is using the DOJ to send a chilling message that anyone who challenges his immigration crackdown is a target. Charging a sitting member of Congress for doing her oversight job is reprehensible.Source: NBC NewsUS Justice Department says Trump can cancel national monuments that protect landscapesWhat Happened: The Justice Department released a legal opinion declaring that presidents can unilaterally abolish national monuments under the Antiquities Act\u2014reversing decades of precedent. The move targets Biden-era monuments like Chuckwalla and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands, which were created in partnership with Native American tribes.Why It Matters: Endless corruption. Trump wants to erase Native history and gut environmental protections to reward fossil fuel and mining allies while using a weaponized DOJ to legitimize it. Source: Associated PressTrump DOJ Fires More Officials Who Investigated HimWhat Happened: The Justice Department fired 2 more staffers connected to probes into Trump\u2019s classified documents and 2020 election interference. That makes 17 Jack Smith team members purged since Trump\u2019s return to power.Why It Matters: This is a systematic purge of those who held Trump accountable. AG Pam Bondi continues using the DOJ as a loyalty enforcer and clearing the path for Trump\u2019s revenge agenda.Source: ReutersParty Politics Is Said to Have Played a Role in Kennedy\u2019s Firing of Vaccine AdvisersWhat Happened: RFK Jr. abruptly fired all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, claiming conflicts of interest. But insiders say the real motive was political because many had ties to Democrats or donated to Democratic campaigns.Why It Matters: Kennedy has turned public health into a partisan loyalty test\u2014purging experts, politicizing science, and echoing Trump\u2019s tactics to consolidate power by silencing dissent and dismantling institutional trust.Source: New York TimesJustice Dept. to Take Narrow Approach to Prosecuting Corporate Bribery AbroadWhat Happened: The Justice Department has shut down half of its foreign bribery cases and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to focus only on violations deemed to hurt U.S. competitiveness. Why It Matters: The continued rollback of corporate accountability gives U.S. firms a green light to bribe foreign officials as long as it serves \u201cnational interest.\u201d Watchdogs call it legalized corruption, and this is another way to protect Trump's businesses and his allies.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Threatens Any Protesters at Military Parade With \u2018Very Big Force\u2019What Happened: Trump warned that any protesters at his Washington military parade\u2014marking both the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and his 79th birthday\u2014will face \u201cvery big force,\u201d equating dissent with treason. Organizers of the \u201cNO KINGS\u201d protests shifted plans to avoid being used as props.Why It Matters: Trump is turning military displays into political theater\u2014criminalizing protest, threatening brute force, and echoing tactics used by dictators like Putin and Kim-Jong Un. Source: New York TimesMilitary Parade Marches Into Political Maelstrom as Troops Deploy to L.A.What Happened: On the eve of his military birthday parade, Trump deployed thousands of National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to crack down on mostly peaceful immigration protests, overriding California\u2019s objections. Legal scholars say the move may violate constitutional safeguards, including the Posse Comitatus Act.Why It Matters: Trump continues blurring the line between military power and political theater. The joint show of force in D.C. and L.A. echoes authoritarian regimes like Russia and North Korea, where leaders use tanks, troops, and intimidation to silence dissent and glorify themselves. It\u2019s a dangerous step toward militarizing domestic politics.Source: New York Times\u2018The language of authoritarianism\u2019: how Trump and allies cast LA as a lawless city needing military interventionWhat Happened: Trump and his allies cast Los Angeles as a war zone, using inflammatory rhetoric to justify sending thousands of troops. Though protests were mostly peaceful and contained, figures like Stephen Miller called the city \u201coccupied territory.\u201d Social media was flooded with old footage and false flags to stoke fear and create a pretext for escalation and military use.Why It Matters: This is classic authoritarian playbook\u2014manufacture chaos, flood the zone with lies, and unleash police and military force to crush opposition. LA is the test case, and this will expand nationwide.Source: The GuardianTrump Declares Dubious Emergencies to Amass Power, Scholars SayWhat Happened: Trump is invoking dubious emergency powers to greenlight military deployments, mass deportations, and major economic moves, labeling protests \u201crebellions\u201d and gangs a \u201cforeign invasion.\u201d These claims have no legal basis and are aimed at concentrating power.Why It Matters: By inventing emergencies, Trump continues bypassing Congress, dismantling checks and balances, and laying the groundwork to rule by decree\u2014just as Putin has done in Russia.Source: New York TimesTrump Is Turning ICE Raids and Protests Into Reality TVWhat Happened: As ICE raids in Los Angeles sparked mass protests, Trump turned immigration enforcement into a media spectacle. Reality TV host \u201cDr. Phil\u201d McGraw embedded with ICE, while DHS pushed AI-generated raid videos and gave far-right influencers like Libs of TikTok and Charlie Kirk exclusive access to dramatized arrests. Officials like Kristi Noem appeared in taxpayer-funded PSAs threatening undocumented immigrants\u2014all edited for viral MAGA consumption.Why It Matters: This is propaganda in action\u2014turning state violence into entertainment, weaponizing media to demonize immigrants, and normalizing repression through disinformation. As in Russia, Trump is fusing government force, surveillance, and spectacle for his loyalist base and to crush dissent.Source: WIREDABC journalist Terry Moran out at network after social media post about Stephen MillerWhat Happened: ABC News terminated senior correspondent Terry Moran after he posted on social media that Stephen Miller is a \u201cworld-class hater\u201d who \u201ceats his hate,\u201d also calling Trump a hater fueled by self-glorification. The network said Moran\u2019s comments violated objectivity and fairness standards.Why It Matters: Moran\u2019s firing highlights the growing pressure on journalists to self-censor criticism of Trump officials, especially as media outlets face political and legal threats from Trump and increasingly come under investigation.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDetention and Deportation as Seen Through a Family Group ChatWhat Happened: Carlos Itriago Arevalo, a Venezuelan immigrant with Temporary Protected Status, was detained by ICE in Florida and secretly disappeared, despite legal protections. His removal was carried out under Trump\u2019s executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act to mass-expel Venezuelans.Why It Matters: Disappearing TPS holders in secret mirrors authoritarian tactics\u2014where people vanish without explanation. It sets a chilling precedent that endangers millions of legally present immigrants.Source: New York TimesTrump Says Army Bases Will Revert to Confederate NamesWhat Happened: Trump announced the restoration of Confederate-era names for U.S. Army bases, reversing bipartisan reforms meant to remove honors for those who fought to uphold slavery. The Army claims the changes refer to different namesakes\u2014but Trump made clear it\u2019s about \u201cbringing back pride\u201d in figures like Robert E. Lee.Why It Matters: This is historical revisionism in service of white supremacy to rewrite the past and divide the present. Trump is using the military to revive the Lost Cause myth, bypassing federal law and glorifying a rebellion against the United States. Source: New York TimesAppeals Court Pauses Order to Give Deported Venezuelans Due ProcessWhat Happened: A federal appeals court paused an order requiring Trump to provide due process to nearly 140 Venezuelans disappeared under the Alien Enemies Act. The men were sent to El Salvador without hearings and are imprisoned in a gulag.Why It Matters: The pause delays justice for detainees already stripped of basic rights and due process. Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchConsumer Bureau Official Quits, Citing \u2018Attack\u2019 on Agency\u2019s MissionWhat Happened: Cara Petersen, acting head of enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, resigned in protest, accusing Russell Vought of gutting the agency. Lawsuits were halted, staff targeted for purges, and consumer refund agreements voided.Why It Matters: By kneecapping the CFPB, Trump\u2019s team continues siding with corporate abusers over Americans, leaving fraud victims powerless and watchdogs silenced.Source: New York TimesThe Bleach Community Is Ready for RFK Jr. to Make Their Dreams Come TrueWhat Happened: After RFK Jr. mentioned chlorine dioxide\u2014a toxic bleach solution\u2014during his Senate confirmation, online communities that promote it as a \u201ccure\u201d for everything from autism to cancer surged in activity. Bleach influencers, previously prosecuted or investigated for dangerous health claims, are now reemerging, connecting with Trump-aligned figures and attending events at his Doral resort. The FDA\u2019s 2019 warning about chlorine dioxide quietly disappeared from its website last month, fueling belief among advocates that government approval may be on the horizon.Why It Matters: This is a public health nightmare in the making. Fringe bleach activists are being empowered by RFK Jr., and hope he will turn dangerous conspiracy theories into potential policy. The quiet removal of FDA safety warnings reiterates that science and public health are being replaced with conspiracies and disinformation. Source: WIREDDocument Shows E.P.A. Plans to Loosen Limits on Mercury From Power PlantsWhat Happened: The EPA under Lee Zeldin is preparing to weaken mercury limits by up to 70% for some coal plants and repeal all federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The rollback reverses key Biden-era protections designed to limit brain-damaging toxins and curb climate change.Why It Matters: This is a catastrophic win for polluters. Mercury poisons children\u2019s brains, and eliminating emissions rules hands fossil fuel companies a blank check to intensify global warming. It\u2019s a continued deliberate assault on science, public health, and the climate\u2014engineered to serve Trump\u2019s coal donors at the expense of future generations.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchEU Unveils New Sanctions on Russia, Targets Nord Stream and Shadow FleetWhat Happened: The European Commission announced its 18th sanctions package against Russia, proposing a ban on Nord Stream pipeline transactions, lowering the oil price cap to $45/barrel, and blacklisting 77 additional ships in Russia\u2019s shadow fleet. The package also includes restrictions on Russian banks and tighter enforcement on energy exports.Why It Matters: As Trump pushes Ukraine toward surrender, the EU is ramping up pressure on Moscow. If the Nord Stream ban and new sanctions are enforced, they\u2019ll cut Kremlin war revenues and show the West can still stand together\u2014despite Putin\u2019s divide-and-conquer strategy and Trump\u2019s efforts to fracture allied resolve.Source: New York TimesU.S. Teacher Abducted by Russia Found in Prison After Months MissingWhat Happened: Stephen James Hubbard, a 73-year-old retired American teacher, has been located in a Russian penal colony in Mordovia after vanishing for months. He was abducted from Ukraine in 2022, falsely accused of being a mercenary, and tortured in custody. The U.S. deems him \u201cwrongfully detained.\u201dWhy It Matters: Hubbard\u2019s case is a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s hostage diplomacy\u2014fabricating charges, torturing detainees, and disappearing them to extract concessions or swap for their spies and criminals. His secret trial underscores the Kremlin\u2019s contempt for international law and its use of Westerners as bargaining chips. No one should travel to Russia.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchWhy the MAGA Right Became Obsessed With the Romanian ElectionWhat Happened: A surprise first-round win by far-right, pro-Putin Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu\u2014amplified by a Russian TikTok disinformation blitz\u2014was overturned by Romania\u2019s top court due to foreign interference. MAGA figures immediately rallied behind Georgescu, declaring the election \u201crigged.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a clear example of Russian active measures spreading through the MAGA ecosystem to prop up a Kremlin-backed candidate and delegitimize democratic institutions. Romania was the latest battleground in a broader transatlantic war on liberal democracy, where U.S. far-right leaders acted as megaphones for Putin\u2019s agenda.Source: New York TimesRight-Wing Disinformation Floods Social Media Amid LA ICE ProtestsWhat Happened: As protests erupted in Los Angeles against Trump\u2019s aggressive ICE raids and military deployment, right-wing influencers and pro-Russian accounts flooded social media with disinformation, amplifying lies of citywide chaos, Mexican government support, and \u201cSoros-funded\u201d violence. A debunked photo of stacked bricks, viral since 2020, reappeared to stoke fear and justify the crackdown.Why It Matters: Trump and his allies are using coordinated disinformation to paint LA as a war zone, justifying military crackdowns and authoritarian power grabs. It\u2019s a Russian-style disinformation playbook that distorts reality, discredits dissent, and justifies repression.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTariffs expected to lift underlying US consumer prices What Happened: New data forecast modest increases in U.S. consumer prices for May, with core inflation expected to rise 0.3%\u2014the biggest monthly jump since January. Economists say Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to filter through to consumer goods, with further price hikes expected into the summer.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade policies are driving inflation while the federal government\u2019s ability to monitor it deteriorates due to staffing purges and hiring freezes at key agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This combination of rising costs and reduced oversight raises red flags about economic transparency and stability.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News50501 EventsCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501More Than 1,500 \u2018No Kings\u2019 Protests Planned What Happened: Over 1,500 protests are planned nationwide under the banner \u201cNo Kings Day,\u201d a coordinated response to Trump\u2019s military parade and crackdown on dissent. The day of action, organized by Indivisible, comes after Trump deployed Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to suppress peaceful immigration protests in Los Angeles.

The probe, which predated Trump\u2019s return to power, examined Musk\u2019s frequent contacts with individuals from Eastern Europe and beyond, raising alarms given his access to classified information and sensitive government contracts.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Musk injected $280 million into Trump\u2019s campaign, turned Twitter into a weapon for disinformation, and maintained contact with Putin. Intelligence officials clearly worried he may become compromised. It would be interesting to know who else bankrolled Trump\u2019s return, and whether Musk was a backdoor for foreign influence and access to U.S. secrets.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/elon-musk-visitors-homeland-security-dbf96364?mod=politics_feat2_national-security_pos1\" rel=\"\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Trump Keeps Starlink at White House Despite Musk Feud<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trump-keeps-starlink-at-white-house-despite-musk-feud\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/165800539/trump-keeps-starlink-at-white-house-despite-musk-feud\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump said he will continue using Starlink at the White House even after a public falling out with Musk.

Trump\u2019s reliance on Musk\u2019s tech shows how critical infrastructure is being privatized and politicized, placing the U.S. in the hands of one erratic billionaire.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/trump-to-keep-starlink-at-white-house-despite-break-with-elon-musk.html\" rel=\"\">CNBC</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Lawmakers Traded Stocks Heavily as Trump Rolled Out \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 Tariffs<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7lawmakers-traded-stocks-heavily-as-trump-rolled-out-liberation-day-tariffs\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/165800539/lawmakers-traded-stocks-heavily-as-trump-rolled-out-liberation-day-tariffs\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> While Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs sent markets plunging, members of Congress and their families made over 700 stock trades in just one week.

The probe, which predated Trump\\u2019s return to power, examined Musk\\u2019s frequent contacts with individuals from Eastern Europe and beyond, raising alarms given his access to classified information and sensitive government contracts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk injected $280 million into Trump\\u2019s campaign, turned Twitter into a weapon for disinformation, and maintained contact with Putin. Intelligence officials clearly worried he may become compromised. It would be interesting to know who else bankrolled Trump\\u2019s return, and whether Musk was a backdoor for foreign influence and access to U.S. secrets.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/elon-musk-visitors-homeland-security-dbf96364?mod=politics_feat2_national-security_pos1\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Keeps Starlink at White House Despite Musk Feud</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump said he will continue using Starlink at the White House even after a public falling out with Musk. While Trump hinted he might remove his personal Tesla, he praised Starlink as a \\u201Cgood service\\u201D and brushed off their dispute, calling Musk a former ally and wishing him well.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Keeping Starlink\\u2014a private satellite network\\u2014embedded in White House operations is a national security risk, and creates a foreign-targeted backchannel to U.S. communications and intelligence. Trump\\u2019s reliance on Musk\\u2019s tech shows how critical infrastructure is being privatized and politicized, placing the U.S. in the hands of one erratic billionaire.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/trump-to-keep-starlink-at-white-house-despite-break-with-elon-musk.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Lawmakers Traded Stocks Heavily as Trump Rolled Out \\u2018Liberation Day\\u2019 Tariffs</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> While Trump\\u2019s \\u201CLiberation Day\\u201D tariffs sent markets plunging, members of Congress and their families made over 700 stock trades in just one week. Some lawmakers bought low and profited when Trump paused the tariffs days later, triggering a market rebound.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is textbook corruption. While Americans panicked over their savings, lawmakers exploited inside information to profit off Trump-induced chaos. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-tariffs-congress-stock-trades-4610ff90?mod=politics_more_article_pos14\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>In Trump\\u2019s \\u2018Patriotic\\u2019 Hiring Plan, Experts See a Politicized Federal Work Force</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is mandating loyalty essays, political litmus tests, and \\u201Cpatriotic\\u201D pledges for new federal hires, while gutting traditional civil service protections. Senior officials must now hire only those aligned with Trump\\u2019s agenda, and even \\u201CMake America Great Again\\u201D hats are approved at work.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues replacing nonpartisan public servants with loyalists, turning the U.S. government into a personal political machine. This is a massive step toward the consolidation of power and authoritarian control.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/us/politics/trumps-politicized-federal-work-force.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>LA Mayor: City Is Trump\\u2019s 'Test Case' for Federal Takeover</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Mayor Karen Bass accused Trump of using Los Angeles as \\u201Can experiment\\u201D in federal overreach, saying Marines and ICE raids have created chaos where none existed. She noted the National Guard was deployed before unrest even began and warned the federal takeover strips local authorities of control.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using LA to test police state tactics\\u2014removing local power, deploying military force, and terrifying legal residents. Bass warned that it\\u2019s creating fear, distrust, and driving immigrants underground, even those with legal status.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jun/09/los-angeles-protests-live-tensions-flare-trump-deploys-national-guard-troops\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Tells Troops: \\u2018We Will Liberate Los Angeles\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a politicized, insane speech at Fort Bragg, Trump defended deploying troops to Los Angeles, calling immigration protests a \\u201Cforeign assault\\u201D on U.S. sovereignty. He warned of using \\u201Cvery big force\\u201D at future demonstrations and vowed to \\u201Cliberate\\u201D the city\\u2014language reserved for war zones abroad.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is militarizing domestic politics, using the language of warfare to justify cracking down on dissent. By casting U.S. cities as enemy territory, he\\u2019s normalizing military force as a tool of political control.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-mark-army-milestone-troops-deployed-los-angeles-2025-06-10/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump More Than Doubles Federal Deployments to Los Angeles</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump deployed 700 active-duty Marines and 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles (bringing the total to 4,000)\\u2014despite the city being largely peaceful. The move comes without the formal invocation of the Insurrection Act and over Governor Newsom\\u2019s objections.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another abuse of federal power. Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement protests and using federal troops as political theater, testing the limits of Posse Comitatus and accelerating the collapse of civilian control.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/politics/trump-pentagon-marines-protests.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Leaked Letter: Noem Sought Military Arrests, Drones for LA Protests</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Kristi Noem urged Pete Hegseth to let the military arrest protesters, deploy drones, and deliver munitions to Los Angeles. The letter, sent before Marines were deployed, suggested protesters were aiding \\u201Cforeign terrorist organizations.\\u201D Legal experts warned it was a clear move toward invoking the Insurrection Act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks a major escalation\\u2014treating domestic protests as acts of war and using military force to suppress dissent. Noem\\u2019s framing blurs the line between protest and terrorism, laying the groundwork for mass repression under the guise of national security. A classic tactic used in Russia.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/us-world/article/noem-immigration-protests-letter-20369001.php\\\\\\\">San Francisco Chronicle</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>ICE\\u2019s tactics draw criticism as it triples daily arrest targets</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE has ramped up immigration raids to meet a new target of 3,000 daily arrests\\u2014triple the previous quota.
