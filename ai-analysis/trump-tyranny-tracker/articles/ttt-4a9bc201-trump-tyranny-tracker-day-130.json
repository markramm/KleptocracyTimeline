REUTERS/Joshua RobertsShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 29Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and OlgaGoogle Meet: June 3, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the first in a new series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rqiCAqyAiAs3sXFqCD7T_e1kqW6YrtKCFL_Z5kCOqH0/edit\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsSEC Dismisses Binance Lawsuit What Happened: The SEC quietly dropped its 2023 lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, who were accused of illegal operations and fund misuse. Why It Matters: As Bitcoin surges and MAGA celebrates deregulation, Trump, his family, and allies are cashing in\u2014while writing policy and stripping protections from everyday investors. Source: Wall Street JournalJustice Department Moves to Dismiss Boeing 737 MAX Fraud CaseWhat Happened: The DOJ dropped a criminal fraud charge against Boeing over the 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people, citing a new settlement. Boeing will pay $1.1 billion but won\u2019t face a felony conviction or independent oversight.Why It Matters: Families of crash victims and lawmakers call it a betrayal of justice, arguing Boeing avoids real accountability. Critics say the settlement prioritizes corporate protection over public safety and sets a dangerous precedent.Source: ReutersDoge employees hold stock in firms set to benefit from cuts, Democrats allegeWhat Happened: Senators Warren, Wyden, and Reed are urging the DOJ to investigate Elon Musk\u2019s operatives for conflicts of interest. They allege that his operatives hold stock in companies like Tesla, Amazon, and JPMorgan that directly benefit from their dismantling of federal agencies.Why It Matters: This violates federal law barring employees from working on matters tied to their financial interests. Also, a reminder that Musk\u2019s operatives are unvetted and continue operating without oversight.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Picks Former Far-Right Podcaster to Lead Federal Ethics OfficeWhat Happened: Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia, a 30-year-old ex-podcaster who once called for martial law, to lead the Office of Special Counsel, the federal agency that investigates public corruption and protects whistleblowers.Why It Matters: Ingrassia has no investigative background and has openly supported January 6 insurrectionists and far-right extremists. His nomination to oversee ethics enforcement and whistleblower protections would put those very protections in danger\u2014marking yet another critical oversight office that Trump will hijack and weaponize.Source: New York TimesHidden Provisions in Trump\u2019s Tax Bill Reveal Massive Structural ChangesWhat Happened: Buried inside Trump\u2019s tax bill are nine sweeping changes\u2014limiting court powers, deregulating AI, gutting student aid, taxing immigrants, and creating \"Trump Accounts\" for babies\u2014that reshape U.S. governance far beyond tax policy.Why It Matters: These changes weaken judicial checks, burden the poor and immigrants, and entrench Trump\u2019s agenda into law. Call your Senators to have these provisions stripped out.Source: USA TodayFederal Job Seekers Will Be Quizzed on Trump\u2019s Executive OrdersWhat Happened: Trump has added four required essay questions to federal job applications\u2014asking about applicants\u2019 favorite Trump executive orders, personal loyalty to constitutional principles, and how they would implement Trump\u2019s policies. The changes also apply to lower-level positions like park rangers and VA dental hygienists.Why It Matters: Trump continues turning federal hiring into an ideological loyalty test\u2014screening applicants based on political alignment, not merit. Even low-level roles now require answer on Trump\u2019s executive orders and loyalty to his agenda. It\u2019s a step toward authoritarian control of the civil service, replacing expertise with allegiance.Source: BloombergTrump Stacks Oversight Roles with Loyalists and Scandal-Tainted NomineesWhat Happened: Trump nominated a group of partisan loyalists and ethically compromised figures as inspectors general for key agencies. His picks include former Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito (nepotism allegations), anti-abortion activist Thomas March Bell (with questionable finances), and Cheryl Mason\u2014who is currently advising the agency she\u2019s meant to oversee.Why It Matters: After purging 19 watchdogs, Trump is trying to fill oversight roles with loyalists, which would dismantle corruption oversight, whistleblower protections, and government transparency.Source: Washington PostTrump Criticizes the Fed in a Private Meeting With PowellWhat Happened: In their first meeting since Trump returned to power, he criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. Powell insisted that monetary policy would remain independent and based on nonpolitical analysis.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed attacks on the Federal Reserve come as his chaotic tariff policies, volatile markets, and billionaire-friendly tax plan deepen economic uncertainty. His pressure campaign threatens the Fed\u2019s independence\u2014risking even greater instability as inflation and recession fears grow.Source: New York TimesState Department to Purge 3,400 Jobs What Happened: Trump is eliminating nearly 3,400 State Department jobs and merging or closing 45% of its domestic offices. Democracy and human rights bureaus will be gutted or repurposed, with some replaced by a new \u201cDemocracy & Western Values\u201d office aligned with Trump\u2019s ideology.Why It Matters: This guts America\u2019s diplomatic infrastructure\u2014erasing programs for civil society, human rights, and Afghan allies\u2014while consolidating control under a politicized, loyalty-first State Department. It weakens U.S. influence abroad and hands strategic openings to Russia and China.Source: CBS NewsWIRED Talked to a Fired DOGE Staffer About Who Was Really in ChargeWhat Happened: Sahil Lavingia, a former Musk operative inside the Department of Veterans Affairs, revealed the group operated chaotically through Signal chats. Major decisions were made by Steve Davis, Musk\u2019s close associate, who lacked formal authority, while foreign nationals allegedly helped recruit staff.Why It Matters: Lavingia\u2019s account confirms that Musk\u2019s operatives, not official Trump appointees, were driving decisions behind the scenes. This violates transparency laws and endangers national security, especially since foreign nationals like Baris Akis allegedly helped recruit. Source: WIRED\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsKristi Noem said a migrant threatened to kill Trump. Investigators think he was set upWhat Happened: Kristi Noem publicly accused an undocumented migrant of threatening to assassinate Trump. But law enforcement believe the letter was fake and part of a scheme to get the man deported before he could testify in an unrelated trial. The handwriting didn\u2019t match, and jail calls point to another person trying to frame him.Why It Matters: Noem amplified a lie for political gain\u2014even after investigators found no credible threat. It\u2019s a dangerous example of disinformation being used to justify harsh immigration crackdowns, undermine due process, and stoke fear.Source: CNNTrump Wants to Create an \u2018Office of Remigration\u2019What Happened: Trump is establishing an Office of Remigration, part of a radical reorganization of the State Department aimed at facilitating mass deportations. The office adopts the white nationalist concept of \u201cremigration,\u201d long pushed by European extremists, which seek the removal of migrants, including naturalized citizens deemed \u201cnon-assimilated.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is yet another sign that Trump is embedding white nationalist ideology into official policy. Extremist far-right groups use the term \u201cremigration\u201d as coded language for ethnic cleansing. Now, Trump wants to institutionalize it through a federal office that will work with DHS to carry it out.Source: WIREDTop ICE Deportation Officials Exit Amid Push for Mass ArrestsWhat Happened: ICE\u2019s top deportation official, Kenneth Genalo, is retiring, and two other senior leaders are stepping down or shifting roles. The shakeup comes as Trump pushes for 3,000 arrests per day\u2014an escalation in immigration enforcement.Why It Matters: These leadership changes signal a push to align ICE with Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda. Officials admit current arrest rates fall short, and internal pressure is mounting to deliver on extreme targets despite logistical and legal hurdles.Source: New York TimesTrump Is Weaponizing the Justice Department to Advance His Voter Suppression PlansWhat Happened: The Justice Department has filed its first major voting-related lawsuit\u2014targeting North Carolina for alleged voter roll violations. The suit revives debunked lies from a failed GOP judicial candidate and demands voter roll purges.Why It Matters: DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division\u2014once a key defender of voting access\u2014is now weaponized to suppress votes. With staffing gutted and leadership loyal to Trump\u2019s anti-voting agenda, the DOJ is poised to launch a nationwide assault on voting rights, especially in swing states.Source: Mother JonesTrump Targets 500+ \u2018Sanctuary Jurisdictions\u2019 with Public List, Threatens Funding CutsWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security published a list of over 500 so-called \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d it deems obstructive to federal immigration enforcement. Under a recent executive order, these cities and states could face defunded federal grants and legal action unless they comply with Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda.Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s campaign to punish cities that protect immigrants\u2014turning federal funding into a weapon of political coercion. Source: Associated PressTrump\u2019s DOJ Leaves Abortion Clinics Exposed to ThreatsWhat Happened: Trump has gutted enforcement of the FACE Act, a federal law that protects abortion clinics from threats and obstruction. Clinics report rising harassment, including bomb threats and arson attempts, while the DOJ now only responds in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases. Trump also pardoned 23 convicted anti-abortion activists.Why It Matters: This rollback has emboldened extremists. Abortion providers warn that without federal protection, they face escalating violence, and local law enforcement may not step in. Source: The New RepublicTrump took action against China due to frustration on trade talks, officials sayWhat Happened: After China refused to ease rare earth export restrictions, Trump announced plans to revoke Chinese student visas and block tech exports. Marco Rubio warned that more crackdowns are coming, linking them to national security.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aggressive retaliation is fueling instability in U.S.\u2013China relations. Visa bans and tech blacklists deepen economic decoupling and risk derailing future negotiations.Source: CNNTrump Tyranny Tracker is a reader-supported publication.

By framing court rulings as illegitimate, he\u2019s undermining trust in legal institutions and laying the groundwork to justify ignoring them. A direct assault on the rule of law continues.Source: New York TimesSharp spike in threats to judges prompts calls for more securityWhat Happened: The U.S. Marshals Service has investigated 373 threats to federal judges in just the first five months of 2025, on pace to break records, as Trump\u2019s rhetoric escalates and lawsuits mount. Threats include doxxing, swatting, and ominous pizza deliveries to judges\u2019 homes.Why It Matters: Judges overseeing Trump-related cases are increasingly targeted, while funding for their protection remains stagnant. Officials and lawmakers are demanding urgent security upgrades, warning that judicial independence is at risk as Trump\u2019s allies label rulings against him \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201ccoups.\u201dSource: Washington Post\u2018Trump Train\u2019 the Latest in GOP\u2019s Renaming SpreeWhat Happened: Florida Rep. Greg Steube introduced a bill to rename Washington, D.C.\u2019s Metro system the \u201cTrump Train\u201d and rebrand its operator as WMAGA\u2014tying federal transit funding to the change. It\u2019s part of a growing Republican campaign to rename infrastructure in Trump\u2019s honor, from airports to highways.Why It Matters: These symbolic moves aim to embed Trump into America\u2019s physical and cultural landscape\u2014mirroring Russia, where leaders build personality cults to dominate public life. It\u2019s about control and loyalty.Source: USA TodayTrump Rejects $15M Settlement Offer in \u201860 Minutes\u2019 LawsuitWhat Happened: Trump turned down a $15 million offer from Paramount to settle his lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Kamala Harris. He\u2019s demanding $25 million and a public apology, alleging the segment was \u201cdeceptively\u201d edited to favor Harris.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s legal attack comes as Paramount eyes a major merger\u2014fueling fears of political interference to settle personal scores. His threats to strip CBS of its license are mafia-style tactics, using state power to intimidate and crush the independent press.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Bans Use of Race and Sex Data in Federal HiringWhat Happened: Trump ordered all federal agencies to stop using race, sex, ethnicity, or national origin data in hiring, under a January executive order to \u201crestore merit.\u201d The directive also bans sharing demographic data or using the concept of \u201cunderrepresentation\u201d in recruitment.Why It Matters: This will bury vital data that exposes systemic discrimination\u2014making bias harder to track, prove, or fix. Source: ReutersState Department to Shut Down Afghan Refugee Support OfficeWhat Happened: The State Department is closing the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, which helped resettle Afghans who supported U.S. forces. Its responsibilities will be absorbed into the Afghanistan Affairs Office as part of Trump\u2019s reorganization plan.Why It Matters: This dismantles a key support structure for America\u2019s Afghan allies, many of whom still face Taliban threats. With refugee funding already slashed and relocation efforts stalled, the closure signals a betrayal of wartime promises and puts thousands of lives in further danger. Shawn VanDiver, a veteran and president of AfghanEvac, a nonprofit organization that helps resettle Afghan allies, said in a statement. \u201cEliminating it \u2014 without public explanation, transition planning, or reaffirmation of mission \u2014 is a profound betrayal of American values and promises.\u201dSource: BloombergThe White House is sued over lack of sign language interpreters at press briefingsWhat Happened: The National Association of the Deaf filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump White House for failing to provide American Sign Language interpreters during press briefings and public events. The suit names Trump, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, alleging violations of federal disability laws.Why It Matters: Cutting ASL access blocks hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans from essential government information. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s wider rollback of accessibility and civil rights\u2014dismantling DEIA programs and gutting protections for marginalized communities.Source: NPRHow Trump Twisted the Law to Protect White Men From DiscriminationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s EEOC sent warning letters to top law firms, claiming their DEI policies \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against male and white candidates\u2014arguing that race and sex protections under Title VII now apply to them. The move sidesteps normal procedures and marks a radical reinterpretation of civil rights law.Why It Matters: This is a sharp reversal of the EEOC\u2019s founding purpose\u2014to defend the rights of marginalized groups. By twisting civil rights law into a tool of white grievance politics, Trump\u2019s EEOC is dismantling anti-discrimination protections and erasing decades of hard-won progress on equality.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch\u201cThe Federal Government Is Gone\u201d: Under Trump, the Fight Against Extremist Violence Is Left Up to the StatesWhat Happened: Trump shut down federal programs meant to prevent domestic extremism. DHS prevention offices were dismantled, hate-crime hotlines defunded, and extremist threat tracking stopped. States like Michigan are trying to fill the gap, but many are unprepared or inactive.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling the federal response to domestic extremism\u2014defunding prevention, killing data collection, and leaving states to fend for themselves. As he pardons violent insurrectionists, far-right threats grow unchecked.Source: ProPublicaThe MAHA Report Cites Studies That Don\u2019t ExistWhat Happened: RFK Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report included at least seven fake studies and misrepresented numerous others, according to researchers interviewed by NOTUS. Citations in the report linked to broken URLs, fabricated articles, or data that contradicted the report\u2019s claims.Why It Matters: The MAHA report appears to have relied on AI junk citations and fake studies to push a political agenda. As Trump and RFK Jr. gut public health funding and attack evidence-based medicine, they\u2019re replacing it with sloppy propaganda. Source: NOTUSMajor USDA cuts cripple food banks, school food programs in North CarolinaWhat Happened: Trump slashed over $1 billion in USDA funding for school districts and food banks, including $660M from the Local Food for Schools program and $420M from local food aid programs.Why It Matters: In North Carolina, schools and farms are losing critical funding, forcing layoffs and cutting fresh produce access for students. Food banks are bracing for a spike in hunger amid a worsening food crisis.Source: CBS NewsWoman\u2019s Life-Saving Cancer Trial Delayed by Trump Cuts to NIHWhat Happened: Natalie Phelps, a mother with stage 4 colorectal cancer, has had her experimental immunotherapy treatment delayed due to staffing purges at the NIH. The trial, once slated to begin in mid-June, is now pushed to late July, with her condition worsening rapidly in the interim.Why It Matters: Phelps\u2019s case shows the dangerous consequences of hollowing out public health infrastructure. Despite RFK Jr.\u2019s false claims that she was ineligible, NIH confirmed she qualified for the trial. This sparked a Senate confrontation, exposing the lies and damage from Trump\u2019s agenda.Source: The GuardianAFRICOM asks for help deterring terrorism, after Trump pulls aid to allied countriesWhat Happened: AFRICOM Commander Gen. Michael Langley warned that Trump\u2019s aid cuts are crippling U.S. counterterrorism operations in Africa, allowing al-Shabaab and ISIS to grow stronger\u2014with the potential to strike the U.S. China is filling the vacuum, training and arming African militaries as American influence recedes.Why It Matters: The Sahel is now the \u201cepicenter of terrorism,\u201d and without U.S. support, extremists are gaining ground. Trump\u2019s policy shift risks global security and cedes strategic influence in Africa to China and Russia.Source: Defense OneAmerican doctors look to relocate to Canada to avoid the Trump administrationWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return to power, American doctors are increasingly moving to Canada, citing moral concerns and fear of reprisal. One ER doctor who relocated says the U.S. is now punishing the vulnerable. Canada has seen a 750% spike in U.S. doctors applying for licenses, with many stating outright they\u2019re leaving due to Trump.Why It Matters: This wave of medical emigration signals a profound collapse of trust in the U.S. government by frontline health professionals. America is losing expertise as Trump carries out his war on science and endangers public health.Source: NPR\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchThe West Is Still Funding Russia\u2019s War Through Fossil Fuel ImportsWhat Happened: Since Russia\u2019s full-scale 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it has earned over \u20ac883 billion from fossil fuel exports\u2014three times more than all aid sent to Ukraine. The EU alone paid \u20ac209 billion, and while some bans exist, Russian oil is still flowing through \u201claundromat\u201d routes via Turkey and India, where it's rebranded and sold legally.Why It Matters: The West is funding both sides of the war\u2014arming Ukraine while sending billions to Russia via fossil fuel loopholes. Weak sanctions, energy fears, and rebranded oil from Turkey and India are allowing Russia to carry out its genocidal war.Source: BBC News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchNorth Korea Sends Missiles, Troops to Aid Russia in Ukraine WarWhat Happened: A new multilateral report reveals North Korea has sent over 100 ballistic missiles and 11,000 troops to support Russia\u2019s genocidal war in Ukraine. The missiles have been used to attack civilian targets, while North Korean troops\u2014wearing Russian uniforms\u2014are fighting alongside Russian forces.Why It Matters: Ukraine is fighting a coalition\u2014Russia and North Korea, with weapons flowing from China and Iran\u2014 on its own. As Russia enables North Korea\u2019s military buildup and evades sanctions, Trump provides cover to Russia. Source: BloombergSteve Bannon and his guest agree: Trump should suspend habeas corpus if the Supreme Court doesn't end nationwide injunctionsWhat Happened: Steve Bannon endorsed a proposal on his War Room podcast that Trump should suspend habeas corpus if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t restrict nationwide injunctions. Why It Matters: Suspending habeas corpus is dictatorship territory. It would shred a core constitutional protection and let the government detain people without charges. Bannon, among others, has been laying the groundwork for Trump to ignore the courts, disappear opponents, and rule without checks.Source: Media MattersTrump administration emerges as a staunch defender of Germany's far-right AfDWhat Happened: JD Vance and Marco Rubio are openly backing Germany\u2019s far-right AfD, which German intelligence classifies as an extremist group. They\u2019ve condemned investigations into the party as \u201canti-democratic.\u201d Meanwhile, Elon Musk campaigned with AfD, calling them \u201cthe only ones who can save Germany.\u201dWhy It Matters: The Trump White House is legitimizing and empowering a party tied to Nazi rhetoric, Russian funding and logisitical support, and an anti-democratic agenda\u2014undermining Europe\u2019s institutions from within. This further reiterates a dangerous global alignment between the American government and far-right extremist movements across the globe.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Tariffs Reinstated After Court Grants Temporary StayWhat Happened: A federal appeals court temporarily restored Trump\u2019s tariffs after a trade court ruled he had exceeded his authority. The stay allows tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners\u2014including Canada, Mexico, and China\u2014to remain in place pending further legal arguments in early June.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to bypass Congress for trade decisions is under intense legal scrutiny. The back-and-forth has rattled markets and is creating more global uncertainty.Source: ReutersTariff Rulings Inject New Uncertainty Into Trump Trade StrategyWhat Happened: A federal court struck down Trump\u2019s tariffs imposed under emergency powers, ruling he exceeded legal authority. Hours later, an appeals court paused that decision, leaving the tariffs in place for now and injecting deep uncertainty into U.S. trade policy.Why It Matters: The conflicting rulings cast doubt on Trump\u2019s legal ability to impose global tariffs. His trade strategy, built on threats and economic pressure, faces major legal obstacles, as businesses, allies, and global markets remain in limbo.Source: New York TimesU.S. Ports Grapple With On-Again, Off-Again TariffsWhat Happened: Ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach are facing chaos as Trump\u2019s tariffs were struck down by one court\u2014then reinstated hours later by another. Port officials say this on-again, off-again cycle is paralyzing trade flows.Why It Matters: With tariffs rising and falling unpredictably, businesses and port operators face massive uncertainty. Import volumes are down sharply, and leaders warn the constant policy shifts are \u201cunprecedented\u201d and damaging to the economy.Source: New York TimesUS corporate profits decrease sharply in first quarterWhat Happened: U.S. corporate profits plunged by $118 billion in Q1 2025, the sharpest drop since the pandemic. The fall follows Trump\u2019s tariffs, which have disrupted supply chains and triggered economic uncertainty.Why It Matters: The tariff chaos is undermining economic growth, eroding business confidence, and prompting companies to withhold 2025 financial guidance. The Commerce Department confirms GDP shrank 0.2%\u2014signaling a weakening economy with rising risks.Source: ReutersU.S.\u2013China Trade Talks Stall, May Require Trump\u2013Xi CallWhat Happened: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says trade negotiations between the U.S. and China have stalled.

Boeing will pay $1.1 billion but won\\u2019t face a felony conviction or independent oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Families of crash victims and lawmakers call it a betrayal of justice, arguing Boeing avoids real accountability.

They allege that his operatives hold stock in companies like Tesla, Amazon, and JPMorgan that directly benefit from their dismantling of federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This violates federal law barring employees from working on matters tied to their financial interests.

The changes also apply to lower-level positions like park rangers and VA dental hygienists.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues turning federal hiring into an ideological loyalty test\\u2014screening applicants based on political alignment, not merit. Even low-level roles now require answer on Trump\\u2019s executive orders and loyalty to his agenda.

Major decisions were made by Steve Davis, Musk\\u2019s close associate, who lacked formal authority, while foreign nationals allegedly helped recruit staff.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Lavingia\\u2019s account confirms that Musk\\u2019s operatives, not official Trump appointees, were driving decisions behind the scenes.

But law enforcement believe the letter was fake and part of a scheme to get the man deported before he could testify in an unrelated trial. The handwriting didn\\u2019t match, and jail calls point to another person trying to frame him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Noem amplified a lie for political gain\\u2014even after investigators found no credible threat.

Under a recent executive order, these cities and states could face defunded federal grants and legal action unless they comply with Trump\\u2019s mass deportation agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This escalates Trump\\u2019s campaign to punish cities that protect immigrants\\u2014turning federal funding into a weapon of political coercion. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/us-immigration-trump-sanctuary-cities-list-public-ebfd1c9bedaad73a145932d2247af8de\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s DOJ Leaves Abortion Clinics Exposed to Threats</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has gutted enforcement of the FACE Act, a federal law that protects abortion clinics from threats and obstruction. Clinics report rising harassment, including bomb threats and arson attempts, while the DOJ now only responds in \\u201Cextraordinary\\u201D cases. Trump also pardoned 23 convicted anti-abortion activists.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This rollback has emboldened extremists.

Threats include doxxing, swatting, and ominous pizza deliveries to judges\\u2019 homes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Judges overseeing Trump-related cases are increasingly targeted, while funding for their protection remains stagnant.
