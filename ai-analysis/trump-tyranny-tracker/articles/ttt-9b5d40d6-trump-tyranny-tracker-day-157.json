Note: We will not be Live on Monday 6/30.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Moves to Count Crypto as Federal Mortgage AssetWhat Happened: The Federal Housing Finance Agency will now let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac treat cryptocurrency held on U.S.-regulated exchanges as an asset in mortgage applications, without requiring conversion to cash. Why It Matters: Trump is forcing crypto into the housing market, putting millions at risk by tying home financing to a wildly unstable and barely regulated asset. Source: CNBCTrump\u2019s Name Could Adorn Tel Aviv Hotel, Becoming a Symbol or a TargetWhat Happened: The Trump Organization held preliminary talks this spring to brand and manage the under-construction Sarona Hotel in Tel Aviv\u2014just steps from where an Iranian missile landed last week. The deal, discussed by Eric Trump, would mark the family\u2019s first major real estate venture in Israel.Why It Matters: Trump continues turning U.S. foreign policy into a vehicle for personal gain, tying American interests to his real estate\u2014and crypto\u2014deals in one of the world\u2019s most volatile regions.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsWhite House moves to limit sharing of some classified info with Congress after Iran leakWhat Happened: Trump is restricting classified intel access to Congress after a leak showed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites had minimal long-term impact. A DIA assessment contradicted Trump\u2019s public claims of success. Democrats called the move an abuse of power.Why It Matters: This is how authoritarian regimes operate\u2014by censoring intelligence to protect political narratives. Blocking Congress from oversight turns national security into propaganda and erodes democratic checks on executive power.Source: The HillTrump Considers Naming Next Fed Chair Early in Bid to Undermine PowellWhat Happened: Trump is considering naming Jerome Powell\u2019s replacement months before his term ends, aiming to sway Fed policy toward aggressive rate cuts. Top selections include Kevin Warsh, Scott Bessent, and David Malpass\u2014figures seen as subservient to Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: An early pick will undermine the central bank\u2019s independence and destabilizing markets, echoing Nixon-era pressure tactics.Source: Wall Street Journal\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsRep.

Prosecutors claim she \u201cstruck and grabbed officers\u201d after tensions rose over the attempted arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.Why It Matters: This is political retaliation\u2014an attempt by Trump to intimidate officials who oppose his agenda and conduct oversight. Led by his former lawyer Alina Habba, the prosecution has triggered Democratic outrage and renewed demands to shut down Delaney Hall.Source: ABC NewsGabbard: \u2018New intelligence\u2019 confirms Iranian nuclear facilities destroyedWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard now claims \u201cnew intelligence\u201d confirms that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites were destroyed and would take years to rebuild. Her statement came after Trump lashed out over reports that U.S. strikes only delayed Iran\u2019s program by a few months. Gabbard accused the media of selectively leaking \u201clow confidence\u201d intel to undermine Trump.Why It Matters: The timing of Gabbard\u2019s claim\u2014just after Trump\u2019s public outrage\u2014raises red flags about the politicization of intelligence. Shaping official conclusions to match presidential messaging is a hallmark of authoritarian rule and erodes trust with our allies while jeopardizing national security.Source: The HillIn New Assessment, C.I.A. Chief Says U.S. Strikes \u2018Severely Damaged\u2019 Iranian ProgramWhat Happened: CIA Director John Ratcliffe claimed new intelligence shows U.S. strikes \u201cseverely damaged\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program, contradicting earlier Defense Intelligence Agency assessments of only moderate setbacks. Trump insists key facilities were \u201cobliterated,\u201d though no intelligence official has publicly echoed that language.Why It Matters: The timing of Ratcliffe\u2019s statement\u2014just after Trump\u2019s exaggerated claims and outrage\u2014raises red flags about the politicization of intelligence. Shaping official conclusions to match presidential messaging is a hallmark of authoritarian rule and erodes trust with our allies while jeopardizing national security.Source: New York TimesVeterans' Advocates Warn of Low Morale Amid LA Deployment: 'This Is Not What We Signed Up For'What Happened: Morale among National Guard troops in Los Angeles is plummeting as thousands of soldiers, deployed by Trump against immigrant communities and protestors, report fear, legal confusion, and a sense of betrayal. Veterans\u2019 groups say this federal takeover of the California Guard has sparked a flood of calls from distressed troops questioning their orders. Meanwhile, key wildfire response units are now understaffed, raising public safety concerns.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deployment pits troops against civilians, undermines recruitment, strains readiness, and severs the military\u2019s bond with the public. Sending combat units like the 2/7 War Dogs to occupy American streets is authoritarian overreach.Source: Military.comRubio Fleshes Out Trump\u2019s Case That Iran Nuclear Capacity Was EliminatedWhat Happened: At the NATO summit, Marco Rubio claimed U.S. airstrikes wiped out Iran\u2019s ability to build a nuclear weapon, citing a destroyed fuel conversion facility. Trump called the strike \u201cflawless\u201d and dismissed a U.S. intelligence report that found the damage was significant but not decisive. Despite declaring victory, Trump left open whether he\u2019d pursue further diplomacy.Why It Matters: The White House is spinning a narrative of total success while sidelining intelligence and diplomacy. Trump\u2019s erratic posture and Rubio\u2019s saber-rattling risk deeper escalation with Iran\u2014and conceal the real status of its nuclear threat.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsNorwegian Tourist Says He Was Denied U.S. Entry Over J.D. Vance MemeWhat Happened: A 21-year-old Norwegian tourist says ICE barred him from entering the U.S. after agents found a meme mocking J.D. Vance on his phone. DHS denies that it was the reason, but it follows similar reports of travelers turned away over online posts.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s digital border surveillance is expanding beyond security into political vetting. Banning travelers over speech sends a chilling message\u2014entry to the U.S. now hinges on ideological alignment.Source: TIMETrump Calls for Firing of CNN Reporter Over Iran Nuclear Damage ReportWhat Happened: Trump demanded that CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand be fired after she reported that U.S. intelligence believes recent Iran strikes will only delay its nuclear program by months. Calling her \u201cFake News,\u201d he claimed she insulted \u201cPatriot Pilots\u201d and said she should be \u201cthrown out like a dog.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is yet another attempt by Trump to silence journalists who contradict his propaganda. Attacking the press for reporting verified intelligence weakens national security discourse and undermines the public\u2019s right to know.Source: The HillFlock Removes States From National Lookup Tool After ICE and Abortion Searches RevealedWhat Happened: License plate reader company Flock blocked police access in California, Illinois, and Virginia after it was revealed officers used the tech to help ICE and track a woman who self-managed an abortion\u2014violating state laws and privacy protections.Why It Matters: Flock\u2019s decision confirms its system was weaponized for immigration and reproductive surveillance. It highlights how vulnerable Americans are to misuse of private surveillance tech\u2014and the urgent need for stronger legal safeguards.Source: 404 MediaUS military expected to announce two new zones where service members can detain migrants on southern border, officials sayWhat Happened: The Pentagon will designate two new \u201cNational Defense Areas\u201d along the southern border, allowing U.S. troops to detain migrants near Joint Base San Antonio and MCAS Yuma. This brings the total to four military-controlled zones spanning hundreds of miles, enabling detentions without invoking the Insurrection Act.Why It Matters: Trump continues militarizing the border and sidestepping civilian law. By turning military bases into detention zones, he\u2019s bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act and due process\u2014an authoritarian move legal experts warn is \u201cunprecedented\u201d and built on legal fiction.Source: CNN\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDespite promise to remove 'worst of the worst,' ICE has arrested only 6% of known immigrant murderersWhat Happened: Internal ICE data reveals that just 6% of over 13,000 undocumented immigrants with homicide convictions have been arrested, despite Trump\u2019s vow to target violent criminals. Of the 185,000 people ICE booked between October and May, nearly half had no criminal charges, and most convictions were for immigration or traffic offenses.Why It Matters: While promising to go after violent offenders, ICE has instead prioritized mass arrests of non-criminals, undermining public safety and exposing the policy as more political theater than crime control, while committing mass human rights violations.Source: NBC NewsLos Angeles' immigration detention facilities a \"ticking time bomb,\" immigration lawyer saysWhat Happened: Immigration lawyers and families are sounding the alarm over inhumane conditions in Los Angeles detention centers after Trump\u2019s mass deportation raids. Detainees report freezing cells, medical neglect, and being denied food, phones, and legal counsel. One family was deported to Peru despite a pending asylum hearing.Why It Matters: ICE is operating at 140% capacity under lawless conditions. With oversight blocked and legal rights ignored, the system is breaking down\u2014turning detention into punishment and endangering lives in the process.Source: CBS News Promise of Victory Over H.I.V. Fades as U.S. Withdraws SupportWhat Happened: A revolutionary HIV prevention drug, lenacapavir, was set for rollout across Africa this year, offering nearly total protection. But Trump\u2019s massive cuts to global health funding\u2014including PEPFAR and the Global Fund\u2014have gutted the plan. Clinics are closing, trials are canceled, and key prevention programs are collapsing just as infection rates risk surging again.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aid cuts are destroying decades of progress, putting millions\u2014especially young women in Africa\u2014at renewed risk in the name of isolationism.Source: New York Times\u2018They're Not Breathing\u2019: Inside the Chaos of ICE Detention Center 911 CallsWhat Happened: A WIRED investigation revealed hundreds of 911 calls from ICE detention centers, exposing a surge in medical emergencies, suicide attempts, and alleged assaults\u2014many involving delayed or denied care. Georgia\u2019s Stewart Detention Center, the deadliest in the U.S. since 2017, tripled its emergency calls this year amid reports of fatal staff negligence.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to detain 100,000 people is collapsing the system. With oversight dismantled and private contractors cashing in, detention centers have become deadly camps of abuse, neglect, and suffering\u2014with no accountability or oversight.Source: WIREDInside the Global Deal-Making Behind Trump\u2019s Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump is pressuring over 50 countries\u2014including unstable and authoritarian regimes\u2014to accept deported migrants, even when they aren\u2019t citizens. Some, like Rwanda and Kosovo, agreed in return for cash or favors. Deportations to South Sudan and Libya have already occurred before courts stepped in.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous outsourcing of deportation that tramples asylum rights and due process. By sending people to war zones and dictatorships, Trump is shredding America\u2019s human rights legacy and putting lives at risk.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchRevised GOP Plan Would Sell Off 1.2M Acres of Public LandsWhat Happened: Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Lee, are advancing a plan to sell up to 1.2 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land as part of Trump\u2019s legislative megabill. Targeted lands near population centers would be designated for housing or infrastructure, excluding national forests and protected areas.Why It Matters: This would hand over national resources to developers with little oversight, bypassing debate through reconciliation to bankroll tax cuts for the rich.Source: The HillTrump\u2019s Bill Slashes the Safety Net That Many Republican Voters Rely onWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax-and-spending bill would cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid and $300 billion from food stamps, stripping healthcare from 11 million people and slashing benefits for millions more. The bill offers major tax breaks for the wealthy while imposing work requirements and shifting SNAP costs to states\u2014hurting low-income Americans, including many Trump voters.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting safety net programs to fund tax cuts for the rich\u2014at the expense of the working class and the vulnerable. Republicans are banking on culture wars to distract from the economic pain, but backlash is growing as core programs face collapse.Source: New York TimesWhite House to limit intelligence sharing, skip Gabbard at Senate Iran briefingWhat Happened: The White House will limit classified intel sharing with Congress after leaks contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that U.S. strikes \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump excluded DNI Tulsi Gabbard from a key Senate briefing, replacing her with CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who is now backing the revised line that Iran was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is politicizing intelligence to protect his narrative. By sidelining dissenters and restricting oversight, he\u2019s defying Congress and undermining accountability on war powers.Source: Washington PostKennedy\u2019s vaccine panel to review childhood immunization scheduleWhat Happened: RFK Jr.\u2019s CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel will review the full childhood and adolescent vaccine schedule\u2014including shots like hepatitis B and MMR. New work groups will study cumulative effects and timing, echoing Kennedy\u2019s vaccine skepticism.Why It Matters: This paves the way for political interference in vaccine policy. Experts warn it could erode trust, fuel more disinformation, and reverse decades of disease prevention\u2014endangering the health and safety of millions of children.Source: PoliticoKennedy Withdraws U.S. Funding Pledge to International Vaccine AgencyWhat Happened: RFK Jr. announced the U.S. will withdraw a $1.2 billion pledge to Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, accusing it of \u201cignoring the science\u201d on vaccine safety. The move stunned global health leaders and will derail U.S. support for immunizing children in low-income countries.Why It Matters: This marks an official U.S. rejection of global childhood vaccination efforts. Gavi estimates its work has saved 17 million lives. RFK Jr.'s decision, rooted in anti-vaccine ideology, threatens to reverse decades of public health progress and leaves Gavi with a massive funding gap as preventable diseases surge.Source: New York TimesCDC Hires Ex-Leader of RFK Jr.\u2019s Anti-Vaccine GroupWhat Happened: The CDC is hiring Lyn Redwood, former head of RFK Jr.\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, to advise its vaccine safety office. Redwood has long promoted debunked conspiracies linking thimerosal in vaccines to autism and will present to the CDC\u2019s new vaccine advisory panel, now filled with Kennedy appointees.Why It Matters: Redwood\u2019s hiring cements Trump and RFK\u2019s takeover of vaccine oversight with anti-vaccine extremists inside the CDC. Public health experts warn this undermines science-based policy and spreads dangerous disinformation, threatening vaccine confidence and safety.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchRoyal Pomp and Political Flattery Help Sway Trump on NATO UnityWhat Happened: At the NATO summit, Dutch leaders staged a charm offensive\u2014lavish dinners, royal praise, and strategic seating\u2014to keep Trump from blowing up the alliance. He threatened Spain with tariffs, leaked private texts, and only backed NATO after being flattered.Why It Matters: Allies had to treat Trump like a monarch\u2014flattering him to avoid disaster\u2014as he abandons Ukraine, shields Russia. The whole display was reprehensible to watch.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchEurope wants Trump to sanction Russia. Rubio says not yet.What Happened: Marco Rubio said that Trump is holding off on new sanctions against Russia, arguing they would shut down chances for a \u201cceasefire\u201d in Ukraine. European leaders and President Zelenskyy have urged Trump to act, but Rubio insists sanctions would signal that diplomacy has failed.Why It Matters: Trump continues providing cover for Russia as it continues its genocidal attacks on Ukraine. Blocking sanctions under the guise of \u201cdiplomacy\u201d rewards aggression, fractures NATO unity, and helps Putin entrench his occupation while Russia murders Ukrainians every single day.Source: PoliticoNato Softens Stance on RussiaWhat Happened: Nato leaders agreed to dilute language condemning Russia in their final communique at the Hague summit, omitting any direct reference to Russia\u2019s genocidal invasion of Ukraine. The shift reportedly came after pressure from Trump.Why It Matters: This is another win for Russia. Trump\u2019s push to soften NATO\u2019s stance hands the Kremlin a propaganda victory and signals fading Western unity, just as Ukraine needs unwavering support to survive.Source: The TelegraphUkraine, Council of Europe Sign Historic Agreement to Establish Tribunal on Russian AggressionWhat Happened: Ukraine and the Council of Europe signed a landmark agreement to create a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression, aimed at prosecuting senior Russian leaders\u2014including Vladimir Putin\u2014for launching the 2022 full-scale invasion. The tribunal will fill a critical legal gap by addressing crimes the International Criminal Court cannot prosecute due to jurisdictional limits.Why It Matters: This is a landmark step for global justice. By targeting Kremlin leadership, the tribunal affirms that state aggression will carry legal consequences and strengthens Ukraine\u2019s case for accountability. It also reinforces the global norm that launching wars of conquest is a punishable crime.Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsPowell says Fed needs to manage against risk that tariff inflation proves persistentWhat Happened: Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that Trump\u2019s aggressive new tariffs could trigger lasting inflation, making the central bank hesitant to cut rates despite recent cooling in price data. Powell pushed back on Republican pressure for immediate cuts, stressing the Fed must \u201cmanage the risk\u201d of prolonged price increases.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff-fueled trade chaos is colliding with the Fed\u2019s mandate. As he pressures the central bank to slash rates for political gain, it underscores the growing erosion of Fed independence\u2014and the risk of economic fallout from politicized monetary policy.Source: ReutersNew home sales fall to seven-month low in May; supply increasesWhat Happened: U.S. new home sales dropped 13.7% in May\u2014the steepest fall since 2022\u2014driven by high mortgage rates and rising costs from Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported materials like lumber and steel. Inventory surged to its highest level since 2007, while builders slashed prices and paused new projects.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade policies are choking the housing market. With construction permits falling and builder sentiment at a multi-year low, housing is likely to drag down GDP this quarter and deepen affordability concerns for American families.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Trump cannot end union bargaining for federal workers, judge rulesWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s executive order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. The judge ruled the order likely violated First Amendment protections and appeared to target unions hostile to Trump\u2019s agenda.Source: ReutersProtesters rally at US sheriffs meeting to oppose partnerships with immigration authoritiesWhat Happened: Activists rallied outside a national sheriffs' conference in Florida, demanding an end to ICE partnerships that deputize local officers under Trump\u2019s deportation agenda.

Protests also erupted in Oregon outside an ICE facility.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers7/17 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action$3.4 trillion \u2014 Increase to federal deficit from Trump\u2019s House-passed tax-and-spending bill$300 billion \u2014 Cut from food stamps in Trump\u2019s megabill11 million+ \u2014 People losing Medicaid under Trump\u2019s proposed cuts1.2 million acres \u2014 Public land Republicans plan to sell off for development140% \u2014 ICE operating capacity in Los Angeles detention centers6% \u2014 Arrest rate of undocumented immigrants with homicide convictions100,000 \u2014 Targeted detainees under Trump\u2019s expanded ICE policy$450 million \u2014 Cost of Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d detention camp$1.2 billion \u2014 U.S. pledge to Gavi canceled by RFK Jr.17 million \u2014 Lives saved by Gavi\u2019s vaccination programs now at risk2 \u2014 Additional military \u201cNational Defense Areas\u201d Trump is adding along the southern border4 \u2014 Total number of military-run detention zones after expansion3x \u2014 Increase in 911 emergency calls at Stewart Detention Center this year$450 million \u2014 Price tag for Alligator Alcatraz, built in extreme heat with no cooling50+ \u2014 Countries Trump is pressuring to accept deportees, including despot regimes13.7% \u2014 Drop in new U.S. home sales in May amid tariff-driven inflation\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement by turning military bases into detention zones \u2014 Will courts step in to stop this end-run around the Posse Comitatus Act?Trump is using foreign aid and diplomacy to fuel mass deportations \u2014 How many lives will be endangered in war zones and autocratic regimes?Trump is threatening journalists who report facts \u2014 Will the press be able to operate freely under a regime that threatens to punish credible reporting?Trump is politicizing vaccine policy under RFK Jr. \u2014 Will decades of public health progress be undone by anti-science, conspiracy-driven ideology?Trump is cutting Medicaid and food aid for millions to fund tax breaks for the rich \u2014 How will working-class Americans survive the collapse of the safety net?Trump is bypassing Congress to conceal intelligence \u2014 Will lawmakers regain oversight before foreign policy becomes pure propaganda?Trump is outsourcing surveillance and immigration enforcement to private tech firms \u2014 Who will rein in the companies profiting off civil and human rights violations?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Civil Rights Continue Being Erased \u2014 From ICE raids to DHS surveillance, Trump\u2019s policies are stripping rights from immigrants, protesters, and vulnerable communities, turning basic protections into political targets.Surveillance Continues Quietly Expanding \u2014 License plate readers, digital border vetting, unauthorized DOGE sensitive information grab, and Palantir databases are turning the U.S. into a surveillance state\u2014without consent or accountability.Human Rights Are Being Shredded \u2014 Detention centers are overcrowded, dangerous, and deadly\u2014while deportations to war zones continue unchecked.The Safety Net Is Being Torn Apart \u2014 Massive cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and global health programs are putting millions at risk, while billionaires get tax breaks.Public Health Is Under Siege \u2014 Vaccine policy is now run by anti-vaccine extremists, threatening a collapse in trust and a surge in preventable diseases.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Veterans\\u2019 groups say this federal takeover of the California Guard has sparked a flood of calls from distressed troops questioning their orders.

Some, like Rwanda and Kosovo, agreed in return for cash or favors. Deportations to South Sudan and Libya have already occurred before courts stepped in.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a dangerous outsourcing of deportation that tramples asylum rights and due process.

The bill offers major tax breaks for the wealthy while imposing work requirements and shifting SNAP costs to states\\u2014hurting low-income Americans, including many Trump voters.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is gutting safety net programs to fund tax cuts for the rich\\u2014at the expense of the working class and the vulnerable.
