I included all the important news from Friday in the weekend roundup. \ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsUS Treasury Declines to Enforce Anti-Money Laundering LawWhat Happened: The U.S. Treasury Department announced it will not enforce the Corporate Transparency Act, a Biden-era anti-money laundering law requiring businesses to disclose their real owners. Why It Matters: The CTA aimed to curb the use of anonymous shell companies for money laundering and illicit finance. By refusing enforcement, the Treasury is deregulating corporate transparency and ensuring that the U.S. will be a global hub for financial crime.Source: ReutersSpeaker Mike Johnson Is Living in a D.C. House That Is the Center of a Pastor\u2019s Secretive Influence CampaignWhat Happened: House Speaker Mike Johnson has been living in a $3.7 million D.C. townhouse owned by a major GOP donor, which also serves as headquarters for an evangelical pastor\u2019s secretive influence campaign. Pastor Steve Berger, who has close ties to Republican lawmakers and has boasted about inspiring legislation, shares the home with Johnson.Why It Matters: The arrangement raises serious ethical concerns over potential undisclosed influence. Berger and the home\u2019s owner, Lee Beaman, have advocated for policies favoring religious conservatism and deregulation and were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Johnson also failed to report the rental cost in his financial disclosure, raising questions about whether he is paying fair market rent or receiving improper benefits.Source: ProPublicaTrump Still Hasn\u2019t Disclosed His Secret Transition FundersWhat Happened: Trump has failed to disclose the private donors who funded his presidential transition, missing the February 19 deadline. His regime rejected public transition funds, allowing unlimited private contributions and sidestepping the requirement to report donors.Why It Matters: Without disclosure, Americans remain in the dark about who financially influenced the transition, raising serious transparency and ethical concerns. Despite promises, the White House has refused to provide a timeline for disclosure.Source: NOTUSCrypto Prices Surge as Trump Announces Strategic Reserve Including Bitcoin, Ether, and Three Riskier TokensWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to create a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve featuring five digital assets\u2014bitcoin, Ether, solana, Ripple-linked XRP, and cardano. This sent crypto prices soaring, with bitcoin rising 9% to $93,000, ether up 11% to $2,500, and cardano surging nearly 60%.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s cronies and family stand to profit massively, as the move follows his pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, the formation of a digital-asset working group, and ties to major crypto investors.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Slashes Social Security Staff, Raising Service ConcernsWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs\u2014roughly 12% of its workforce\u2014as part of the Trump purge. The cuts come as more Americans than ever rely on Social Security, with over 73 million beneficiaries.Why It Matters: With the agency already at a 50-year staffing low, these cuts will devastate customer service, delaying benefits for retirees, disabled Americans, and survivors. Despite Trump\u2019s promises not to touch Social Security, his regime is gutting the agency that ensures people receive their payments.Source: CNNRubio Bypasses Congress to Send Israel $4 Billion in ArmsWhat Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency authority to bypass Congress and send $4 billion in weapons\u2014including 35,000+ 2,000-pound bombs\u2014to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza. This is the second time in a month that Trump has sidestepped congressional approval.Why It Matters: Congress has been rendered irrelevant as the regime unilaterally approves major arms sales and dismantles agencies.

The probe seeks to identify political appointees and career staff who remained in the executive branch under Trump, alleging that Biden officials sought to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d agencies.Why It Matters: This effort, spanning 24 agencies, aligns with Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s aggressive push to dismantle the government\u2014firing employees, administering loyalty tests, and enforcing mass layoffs.Source: PoliticoTrump Loyalist Demotes Senior Prosecutors Who Led January 6 CasesWhat Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a Trump loyalist, demoted at least eight senior federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 riot cases, reassigning them to entry-level jobs. The retaliation is aimed at forcing them to resign.Why It Matters: This is a blatant purge of those who held Trump\u2019s insurrectionists accountable, as Ed Martin defended insurrectionists and rioters. By dismantling prosecutions and weaponizing the Justice Department to protect Trump and his allies, Martin is turning the DOJ into an arm of Trump\u2019s authoritarian agenda.Source: CNNTrump\u2019s Pentagon Halts Offensive Cyber Operations Against Russia Amid Ukraine TalksWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, signaling a major shift in U.S. cyber policy. The order issued is part of a broader Trump agenda to show fealty to Russia.Why It Matters: The will endanger U.S. national security and embolden Russia, which has continued cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, hospitals, and European allies. This also disrupts covert efforts by U.S. and allied intelligence agencies to counter Russian sabotage operations, ransomware attacks, and election interference.Source: The New York TimesRepublicans Push Budget Gimmick to Hide Cost of Extending Trump Tax CutsWhat Happened: GOP lawmakers are considering a major accounting change to mask the $4.6 trillion cost of extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. By switching from a \u201ccurrent law\u201d to a \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline, they would claim that extending the cuts costs nothing\u2014allowing them to pass tax breaks without paying for them.Why It Matters: This blatant gimmick would explode the deficit and hurt the majority of Americans while benefiting billionaires and corporations. Democrats warn it\u2019s a dangerous precedent, similar to nuking the filibuster, as Republicans prioritize tax cuts over fiscal responsibility.Source: NBC NewsHomeland Security Pushes IRS for 700,000 Immigrants\u2019 AddressesWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security is pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the addresses of 700,000 undocumented immigrants for mass deportation efforts. The IRS has denied the request, citing taxpayer privacy laws.Why It Matters: Trump is attempting to weaponize the IRS for immigration enforcement despite legal concerns. The IRS has already been hit with 7,000 layoffs, resulting in weakened oversight. This follows broader operations to register migrants and use military sites for deportations.Source: The New York TimesState Department Accused of Evading Refugee Admissions Court OrderWhat Happened: Refugee aid groups accused Trump of trying to bypass a federal court ruling that blocked Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Despite the injunction, the State Department abruptly terminated agreements with resettlement agencies, citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Why It Matters: This is a blatant attempt to undermine the court\u2019s authority and dismantle refugee protections. The regime is gutting legal pathways for displaced people while ignoring judicial oversight.Source: CBS NewsTrump Erases Jan. 6 Tribute Coins Honoring Capitol OfficersWhat Happened: The U.S. Mint quietly removed commemorative coins honoring law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, from its website. These coins were replicas of Congressional Gold Medals awarded in recognition of their service.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s effort to erase Jan. 6 from history. The Justice Department has also deleted web pages on insurrection/riot prosecutions, and Congress has failed to install a memorial for fallen officers.Source: NBC NewsRFK Jr.-Tied \u2018MAHA\u2019 Group Hires Early QAnon Influencer Tracy DiazWhat Happened: MAHA Action, a political advocacy group closely tied to RFK Jr., has hired Tracy \u201cBeanz\u201d Diaz, a major QAnon promoter and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, as its editor-in-chief. The group claims to be focused on transforming national public health policy.Why It Matters: With Kennedy now running HHS under Trump, fringe conspiracy theorists like Diaz and other anti-vaxxers are gaining influence over U.S. health policy, posing serious risks to public health.Source: NOTUSSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsRFK Jr. Moves to End Public Comment on U.S. Health PoliciesWhat Happened: HHS Secretary RFK Jr. is proposing to eliminate public input on key HHS decisions, including regulations impacting the FDA, CDC, Medicare, and Medicaid. This would strip a decades-old policy requiring public feedback on agency actions.Why It Matters: This authoritarian shift undermines transparency and public trust, allowing HHS to impose sweeping health policies without accountability. This also aligns with Trump\u2019s broader power grab, silencing public voices in critical decisions.Source: ReutersTrump Targets Voice of America Journalists for Critical CoverageWhat Happened: Trump is investigating Voice of America journalists for reporting criticism of Trump. Senior journalist Steven Herman was placed on leave, and White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara was reassigned, highlighting the takeover of editorial independence.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader war on press freedom, silencing dissent, and controlling media access. VOA, long despised by Russia, is being gutted and will be turned into a propaganda machine.Source: The New York TimesTrump Declares English the Official U.S. Language, Ends Federal Language AssistanceWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order making English the official language of the U.S., revoking a Clinton-era policy that required federal agencies to provide language assistance for non-English speakers. Why It Matters: This autocratic move undermines linguistic diversity and disproportionately harms immigrant communities. By stripping away essential language assistance, Trump is further marginalizing non-English speakers and restricting access to vital government services.Source: NPRTrump Accused of Sidestepping Court Rulings Amid Legal DefeatsWhat Happened: Courts have blocked multiple Trump efforts to gut federal programs, from refugee admissions to foreign aid and mass government layoffs. Despite the rulings, Trump officials are accused of delaying compliance, terminating contracts, and reclassifying legal challenges to avoid enforcement.Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying court orders and pushing illegal policies, dismantling checks and balances to consolidate power. He has declared himself above the law, ignoring legal constraints to reshape the government.Source: NBC NewsNASA Warns Employees Amid Harassment Reports Tied to Trump RhetoricWhat Happened: NASA officials warned employees to avoid publicly displaying badges and logos identifying them as federal workers due to increasing \u201cnegative rhetoric\u201d and reports of harassment. The warning followed an incident where a NASA employee was confronted at a Starbucks for being a federal worker.Why It Matters: Trump and his cronies are demonizing federal workers, calling them \u201cbloated\u201d and \u201csloppy\u201d while aggressively purging government jobs. The escalating hostility has sparked fears for worker safety. A regime stoking hatred against groups that fit into its agenda is a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: ProPublicaGOP Lawmaker Proposes $250 Bill Featuring Donald TrumpWhat Happened: A Republican lawmaker announced they are drafting legislation to create a new $250 bill featuring Donald J. Trump, citing the need for higher denominations due to \"Bidenflation.\" The proposal directs the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to design the bill in honor of Trump.Why It Matters: This would be the first U.S. bill in decades\u2014and the first ever\u2014to feature a living ex-president. It\u2019s not about inflation; it\u2019s about glorifying Trump and cementing his cult of personality\u2014a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.Source: Rep Joe Wilson on X\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump\u2019s USAID Purge Threatens Life-Saving Infant Nutrition SupplyWhat Happened: USAID\u2019s collapse under Trump and Elon Musk nearly shut down Edesia, a U.S. manufacturer of therapeutic food for malnourished babies. The Rhode Island company\u2019s contract was abruptly terminated, then reinstated, but USAID\u2019s payment system remains down, disrupting supply chains and global aid distribution.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s gutting of USAID is endangering life-saving programs, leaving American businesses, farmers, and humanitarian efforts in chaos. While Musk \u201cpromises\u201d payments will resume, the instability is devastating global food aid.Source: CBS NewsIowa governor signs bill ending transgender rights protections despite large protestsWhat Happened: Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law removing gender identity from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code, eliminating legal protections for transgender individuals. Why It Matters: This marks a major rollback of civil rights, effectively legalizing discrimination against transgender Iowans. Advocates warn it sets a dangerous precedent, stripping protections under the guise of aligning with federal law. Source: CBS NewsTrump Cuts Fair Housing Enforcement FundingWhat Happened: Trump is terminating grants to nonprofits that enforce the Fair Housing Act, investigate discrimination, and provide legal aid.Why It Matters: These groups handle 75% of fair housing complaints, while HUD and the DOJ process less than 6%. With discrimination cases at record highs, the cuts eliminate enforcement and limit protections for vulnerable Americans.Source: Associated PressTrump's English-Only Order Sparks Concerns in Puerto RicoWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s upcoming executive order will make English the official language of the U.S., eliminating federal mandates for multilingual services. Why It Matters: Puerto Rico, a Spanish-speaking U.S. territory, faces uncertainty over how this order will impact education, government services, and its political future\u2014especially if statehood becomes a reality. It erases Puerto Rican identity and limits access to federal programs.Source: NBC NewsTrump Is Sending Migrants From Around the World to Guantanamo. One Mother Speaks Out About Her Son\u2019s Detention.What Happened: Trump has been secretly transferring migrants to Guantanamo Bay, including individuals with no criminal records. The Department of Homeland Security claims some detainees are linked to gangs but has provided no evidence. Families and advocates say migrants are being unfairly targeted, and legal access to detainees is severely restricted.Why It Matters: Detaining migrants at Guantanamo Bay is outrageous and erases due process, violates human rights, and expands government overreach. Blocking legal access makes it clear that it isn\u2019t about security\u2014 it\u2019s about unchecked abuses and mass detentions.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchUS intel shows Russia and China are attempting to recruit disgruntled federal employeesWhat Happened: U.S. intelligence has confirmed that Russia and China are aggressively attempting to recruit recently fired or at-risk federal employees, particularly those with security clearances. Foreign operatives are using LinkedIn, TikTok, and job postings to lure disgruntled workers into espionage roles.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass federal purge is creating a national security crisis, making it easier for foreign adversaries to exploit vulnerable former employees. With the FBI and intelligence agencies weakened, the U.S. is facing an increased espionage threat.Source: CNNTrump Layoffs Hit Space Traffic Control UnitWhat Happened: Trump fired a third of the staff at NOAA\u2019s Office of Space Commerce, which was developing a satellite traffic coordination system.Why It Matters: The cuts weaken U.S. space traffic management, increasing collision risks as Earth\u2019s orbit becomes more crowded. It could also delay satellite launch approvals, impacting the space industry and national security.Source: ReutersTrump Shuts Down GSA\u2019s Tech Unit, Disrupting Government ServicesWhat Happened: Trump shut down the General Services Administration\u2019s 18F tech unit, which developed key government websites and digital services, including the IRS\u2019s free tax-filing system. Why It Matters: 18F played a critical role in improving federal website accessibility, technology modernization, and public services. Its termination raises concerns about the future of free tax-filing and whether the government will leverage personal tax data for fraud checks or immigration enforcement.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchMusk Calls for the U.S. to Withdraw from NATO and UNWhat Happened: Elon Musk publicly called for the U.S. to withdraw from NATO and the United Nations, with Utah Sen. Mike Lee responding, \u201cGet us out of NATO,\u201d on X. Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s role as acting president and Trump\u2019s disdain for U.S. allies raises concerns that U.S. withdrawal from NATO\u2014long a Kremlin goal\u2014could be gaining traction in the White House. Abandoning NATO would dismantle decades of U.S. security strategy, embolden Russia, and endanger U.S. and European security, all while serving Russia\u2019s interests.Source: The IndependentKremlin Praises Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy Shift as Aligned with Russia\u2019s VisionWhat Happened: The Kremlin praised Trump\u2019s foreign policy pivot, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stating it \u201clargely coincides with our vision.\u201d Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s fealty to Moscow highlights his willingness to concede to Russian interests while endangering U.S. interests. The Kremlin\u2019s endorsement underscores Trump's desire to strengthen Putin\u2019s geopolitical ambitions.Source: The GuardianTrump Opens Door for Russia to Rebuild U.S. Spy NetworksWhat Happened: Trump is negotiating with Russia to restore its diplomatic presence in the U.S., including reopening consulates and returning seized properties. Intelligence officials warn this will allow Russia to rebuild its spy network under diplomatic cover.Why It Matters: With the FBI facing cuts and counterintelligence efforts weakened, Trump is giving Putin a major win, allowing Russian operatives back into the U.S. at a time when Russia is still waging war on the West.Source: CNNRussian State Media TASS Gains Unapproved Access to Oval Office During Zelenskyy MeetingWhat Happened: A TASS reporter from Russia\u2019s state-run media was briefly inside the Oval Office during Trump\u2019s meeting with Zelenskyy, while major U.S. outlets like AP and Reuters were barred. The White House claims he was \u201cnot approved\u201d and removed but offered no explanation for how he got in.Why It Matters: TASS is a known front for Russian intelligence, and this was a major security breach as well, as a direct threat to Zelenskyy. Under Trump, it highlights his growing alignment with Russia, giving the Kremlin unprecedented influence over the U.S. government.Source: PoliticoSpeaker Johnson Suggests Zelenskyy Should Resign After Oval Office ClashWhat Happened: House Speaker Mike Johnson said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should \u201ccome to his senses\u201d and accept Trump\u2019s proposed mineral rights deal or \u201csomeone else needs to lead.\u201d GOP leaders, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, echoed calls for Zelenskyy\u2019s resignation.Why It Matters: This is a blatant attempt to pressure Ukraine into a deal that benefits U.S. financial interests while ignoring Ukraine\u2019s security needs. Ukrainian leaders are for Ukrainians to decide, not Trump and Putin. Trump and his cronies pushing for Zelenskyy\u2019s removal mirrors Russia's continuous calling for his removal, on top of trying to assassinate him over the past 3 years.Source: NBC NewsTrump Admin Shuts Down U.S. Support for Ukraine\u2019s Energy GridWhat Happened: Following Trump and Vance\u2019s Oval Office ambush of Zelenskyy, the State Department shut down a USAID program that funded hundreds of millions for Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, which Russia has relentlessly targeted. The agency has also gutted its Ukraine presence, leaving only eight staff on the ground.Why It Matters: Cutting USAID\u2019s energy aid cripples Ukraine\u2019s ability to withstand Russian attacks and reiterates Trump\u2019s abandonment of U.S. support while handing Putin another victory.Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial Watch and Geopolitical WatchHegseth Threatens Military Action if Mexico Fails to Meet Trump\u2019s Border DemandsWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Hegseth warned Mexico\u2019s top military officials that the U.S. could take unilateral military action if Mexico didn\u2019t crack down on drug cartels and migrant trafficking.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 28- Mar 2: Weekend Roundup</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><p>I apologize for missing Friday\\u2019s tracker\\u2014it was a really tough day. I included all the important news from Friday in the weekend roundup. </p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>US Treasury Declines to Enforce Anti-Money Laundering Law</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. Treasury Department announced it will not enforce the Corporate Transparency Act, a Biden-era anti-money laundering law requiring businesses to disclose their real owners. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The CTA aimed to curb the use of anonymous shell companies for money laundering and illicit finance. By refusing enforcement, the Treasury is deregulating corporate transparency and ensuring that the U.S. will be a global hub for financial crime.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-treasury-department-says-it-will-not-enforce-anti-money-laundering-law-2025-03-03/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Speaker Mike Johnson Is Living in a D.C. House That Is the Center of a Pastor\\u2019s Secretive Influence Campaign</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Speaker Mike Johnson has been living in a $3.7 million D.C. townhouse owned by a major GOP donor, which also serves as headquarters for an evangelical pastor\\u2019s secretive influence campaign. Pastor Steve Berger, who has close ties to Republican lawmakers and has boasted about inspiring legislation, shares the home with Johnson.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The arrangement raises serious ethical concerns over potential undisclosed influence. Berger and the home\\u2019s owner, Lee Beaman, have advocated for policies favoring religious conservatism and deregulation and were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Johnson also failed to report the rental cost in his financial disclosure, raising questions about whether he is paying fair market rent or receiving improper benefits.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/mike-johnson-evangelical-pastor-steve-berger-roommates\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Still Hasn\\u2019t Disclosed His Secret Transition Funders</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has failed to disclose the private donors who funded his presidential transition, missing the February 19 deadline. His regime rejected public transition funds, allowing unlimited private contributions and sidestepping the requirement to report donors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without disclosure, Americans remain in the dark about who financially influenced the transition, raising serious transparency and ethical concerns. Despite promises, the White House has refused to provide a timeline for disclosure.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/donald-trump/donald-trump-secret-transition-funders\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Crypto Prices Surge as Trump Announces Strategic Reserve Including Bitcoin, Ether, and Three Riskier Tokens</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced plans to create a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve featuring five digital assets\\u2014bitcoin, Ether, solana, Ripple-linked XRP, and cardano. This sent crypto prices soaring, with bitcoin rising 9% to $93,000, ether up 11% to $2,500, and cardano surging nearly 60%.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s cronies and family stand to profit massively, as the move follows his pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, the formation of a digital-asset working group, and ties to major crypto investors.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-prices-jump-after-trump-announces-five-tokens-for-strategic-reserve-636f31d7?mod=hp_lead_pos5\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Slashes Social Security Staff, Raising Service Concerns</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Social Security Administration announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs\\u2014roughly 12% of its workforce\\u2014as part of the Trump purge. The cuts come as more Americans than ever rely on Social Security, with over 73 million beneficiaries.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With the agency already at a 50-year staffing low, these cuts will devastate customer service, delaying benefits for retirees, disabled Americans, and survivors. Despite Trump\\u2019s promises not to touch Social Security, his regime is gutting the agency that ensures people receive their payments.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/social-security-job-cuts-doge/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Rubio Bypasses Congress to Send Israel $4 Billion in Arms</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency authority to bypass Congress and send $4 billion in weapons\\u2014including 35,000+ 2,000-pound bombs\\u2014to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza. This is the second time in a month that Trump has sidestepped congressional approval.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Congress has been rendered irrelevant as the regime unilaterally approves major arms sales and dismantles agencies. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/rubio-arms-israel.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>GOP-Led Committee Investigates Biden-Era Hires Amid Trump\\u2019s Federal Purge</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Oversight Chair James Comer launched an investigation targeting federal employees hired during the final year of Joe Biden\\u2019s presidency. The probe seeks to identify political appointees and career staff who remained in the executive branch under Trump, alleging that Biden officials sought to \\u201CTrump-proof\\u201D agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This effort, spanning 24 agencies, aligns with Trump and Elon Musk\\u2019s aggressive push to dismantle the government\\u2014firing employees, administering loyalty tests, and enforcing mass layoffs.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/28/congress/gop-led-committee-launches-probe-to-root-out-partisan-hires-00206764\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Loyalist Demotes Senior Prosecutors Who Led January 6 Cases</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a Trump loyalist, demoted at least eight senior federal prosecutors who worked on January 6 riot cases, reassigning them to entry-level jobs. The retaliation is aimed at forcing them to resign.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a blatant purge of those who held Trump\\u2019s insurrectionists accountable, as Ed Martin defended insurrectionists and rioters. By dismantling prosecutions and weaponizing the Justice Department to protect Trump and his allies, Martin is turning the DOJ into an arm of Trump\\u2019s authoritarian agenda.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/federal-prosecutors-january-6-demoted/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Pentagon Halts Offensive Cyber Operations Against Russia Amid Ukraine Talks</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, signaling a major shift in U.S. cyber policy. The order issued is part of a broader Trump agenda to show fealty to Russia.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The will endanger U.S. national security and embolden Russia, which has continued cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, hospitals, and European allies. This also disrupts covert efforts by U.S. and allied intelligence agencies to counter Russian sabotage operations, ransomware attacks, and election interference.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/hegseth-cyber-russia-trump-putin.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Republicans Push Budget Gimmick to Hide Cost of Extending Trump Tax Cuts</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> GOP lawmakers are considering a major accounting change to mask the $4.6 trillion cost of extending Trump\\u2019s 2017 tax cuts. By switching from a \\u201Ccurrent law\\u201D to a \\u201Ccurrent policy\\u201D baseline, they would claim that extending the cuts costs nothing\\u2014allowing them to pass tax breaks without paying for them.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This blatant gimmick would explode the deficit and hurt the majority of Americans while benefiting billionaires and corporations. Democrats warn it\\u2019s a dangerous precedent, similar to nuking the filibuster, as Republicans prioritize tax cuts over fiscal responsibility.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-budget-change-deficit-impact-trump-tax-cuts-rcna194015\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Homeland Security Pushes IRS for 700,000 Immigrants\\u2019 Addresses</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security is pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the addresses of 700,000 undocumented immigrants for mass deportation efforts. The IRS has denied the request, citing taxpayer privacy laws.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is attempting to weaponize the IRS for immigration enforcement despite legal concerns. The IRS has already been hit with 7,000 layoffs, resulting in weakened oversight. This follows broader operations to register migrants and use military sites for deportations.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/irs-immigrants-addresses.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>State Department Accused of Evading Refugee Admissions Court Order</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Refugee aid groups accused Trump of trying to bypass a federal court ruling that blocked Trump's executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Despite the injunction, the State Department abruptly terminated agreements with resettlement agencies, citing a directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a blatant attempt to undermine the court\\u2019s authority and dismantle refugee protections.

These coins were replicas of Congressional Gold Medals awarded in recognition of their service.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of Trump\\u2019s effort to erase Jan. 6 from history.

The group claims to be focused on transforming national public health policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With Kennedy now running HHS under Trump, fringe conspiracy theorists like Diaz and other anti-vaxxers are gaining influence over U.S. health policy, posing serious risks to public health.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/health-science/rfk-jr-tied-maha-group-qanon-influencer-hire\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>RFK Jr. Moves to End Public Comment on U.S. Health Policies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> HHS Secretary RFK Jr. is proposing to eliminate public input on key HHS decisions, including regulations impacting the FDA, CDC, Medicare, and Medicaid. This would strip a decades-old policy requiring public feedback on agency actions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This authoritarian shift undermines transparency and public trust, allowing HHS to impose sweeping health policies without accountability.
