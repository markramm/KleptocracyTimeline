(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 19Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Donates to GOP Lawmakers Backing Judicial ImpeachmentsWhat Happened: Musk made the maximum campaign donations to Republican lawmakers Reps. Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert, Andy Ogles, and Sen. Chuck Grassley. Musk has called judicial rulings against Trump a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d and is using his financial influence to back those pushing for impeachment proceedings.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s donations strengthen his grip on Trump\u2019s agenda, pressuring lawmakers to undermine judicial independence. His financial backing fuels a broader effort to weaken the courts, erode checks on executive power, and consolidate control.Source: The New York TimesSEC Drops Case Against Crypto Firm With Ties to TrumpWhat Happened: The Securities and Exchange Commission has quietly dropped its case against Ripple Labs, a cryptocurrency firm whose CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has close ties to Trump. The SEC had sued Ripple for raising $1.4 billion through unregistered securities but abandoned its appeal just weeks after Garlinghouse attended Trump\u2019s White House crypto summit. Ripple also donated $5 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.Why It Matters: Pure corruption. Trump\u2019s SEC is letting allies off the hook while gutting financial regulation. Ripple dodges a $125M fine, Garlinghouse praises Trump, and the message is clear\u2014justice is for sale.Source: ABC NewsDonald Trump Jr. Mixes Business and Politics in Serbia, as Protests There RageWhat Happened: Donald Trump Jr. visited Serbia amid mass protests against President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 while pushing U.S. support for Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s government. The visit coincided with the Trump family\u2019s hotel project in Belgrade, a $500 million development backed by Jared Kushner. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s family is cashing in on U.S. foreign policy. Donald Trump Jr. is backing Vu\u010di\u0107 while securing a multimillion-dollar hotel deal, blurring the line between diplomacy and personal profit. This is pure corruption.Source: The New York TimesDOGE\u2019s Dodgy Numbers Mirror Tesla\u2019s Misleading Data PracticesWhat Happened: Musk has been caught posting major financial inaccuracies on its website, including falsely claiming an $8 billion budget cut when the actual contract was worth only $8 million. Unauthorized DOGE has also been deleting details that would allow the public to verify its reported savings. Experts say these tactics closely resemble Tesla\u2019s long history of manipulating safety data\u2014omitting key context, retroactively altering statistics, and making unverifiable claims.Why It Matters: Musk is running unauthorized DOGE like Tesla\u2014manipulating data, inflating savings, and erasing accountability. This isn\u2019t just misclaims; it\u2019s authoritarian-style governance, where numbers are rigged to serve Trump\u2019s agenda while the public is kept in the dark.Source: WIREDFired FTC Democrats Warn of Trump\u2019s Big Tech FavoritismWhat Happened: Trump fired Democratic FTC Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, claiming the move was within his legal authority. The two commissioners argue their removal is illegal and fear it will allow Trump to weaken antitrust enforcement against Big Tech companies that donated to him.Why It Matters: The FTC was investigating Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and X. With Slaughter and Bedoya gone, Trump can shield his Big Tech allies from scrutiny. The commissioners warn that their firing will undermine regulatory oversight and prevent whistleblowing on any pro-corporate bias at the FTC.Source: NBC NewsICE Contractor Fights to Keep Paying Detainees $1 a Day Despite $4 Billion ValuationWhat Happened: GEO Group, a private prison company that operates 16 ICE detention centers, is challenging a federal ruling that ordered it to pay detainees minimum wage for cleaning services. Despite record profits under Trump, GEO is fighting to overturn a decision requiring it to pay Washington state\u2019s $16.66 hourly minimum wage instead of $1 per day.Why It Matters: If GEO loses, private detention centers could be forced to pay fair wages instead of exploiting detainee labor.

They warn that Trump may repeal safety rules requiring companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles and fear Musk\u2019s ties will compromise the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s oversight.Why It Matters: Musk is cutting jobs at NHTSA, raising concerns that Tesla investigations will be weakened or halted.

The White House is coordinating efforts to investigate ActBlue, a major Democratic donation platform, and Arabella Advisors. Musk has fueled these attacks, while GOP lawmakers are pushing investigations into Democratic-aligned nonprofits and voter data firms. Why It Matters: This is how authoritarian regimes consolidate power. Trump is using government agencies to kneecap political opposition, just like Putin does in Russia.

Why It Matters: Watch for a potential Trump takeover of the Federal Reserve. Installing loyalists would destroy its independence, erode investor confidence, trigger market volatility, and drive inflation higher. If Trump forces rate cuts for political gain, the dollar could weaken, and global economic chaos would follow.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDOJ Resists Judge\u2019s Demand for Details on Deportation FlightsWhat Happened: The Justice Department refused to comply with a federal judge\u2019s demand for details on flights deporting Venezuelans under Trump\u2019s wartime powers. The DOJ argued that the judiciary was overstepping its authority and hinted at invoking the \"state secrets\" privilege to withhold information.Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying court orders and shielding details of mass deportations from judicial oversight.

This is how authoritarian regimes silence the judiciary.Source: The New York TimesPaul Weiss Law Firm Fired by Client Over Trump Executive OrderWhat Happened: Paul Weiss lost a client due to Trump\u2019s executive order targeting law firms with Democratic ties and diversity policies. Steven Schwartz, a former Cognizant executive facing bribery charges, terminated the firm, fearing its association with Trump-opposed legal work could hurt his case. The order revoked security clearances for Paul Weiss lawyers and restricted their access to federal agencies.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing executive power to punish law firms representing Democrats or promoting diversity.

The webpage\u2019s URL was altered to include \u201cDEI\u201d before disappearing entirely.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate erasure of Black military history, part of a broader effort to rewrite the past and suppress recognition of minority contributions to the U.S. armed forces.

Using Musk\u2019s bogus fraud claims as cover, the regime is setting the stage for deeper cuts.Why It Matters: These cuts will hit retirees of color the hardest, as they are more likely to rely on Social Security as their sole source of income. With fewer offices and stricter rules, many will struggle to access benefits, increasing financial insecurity and hardship for vulnerable seniors.Source: Mother JonesJustice Department Removes Disability Guidelines for US BusinessesWhat Happened: Trump removed 11 guidelines from the Americans with Disabilities Act website, weakening protections for people with disabilities. The scrapped materials included Covid-19 accommodations, accessibility requirements for retail businesses, and customer service practices for hotels.Why It Matters: The Justice Department claims the removals will reduce regulatory burdens on businesses but disability advocates warn this will make it harder for disabled Americans to access basic services and challenge discrimination.

The move follows Trump\u2019s executive order rolling back civil rights protections, including equal employment policies from 1965.Why It Matters: This is a sickening rollback of civil rights, reversing fundamental anti-discrimination protections in government contracting. It signals a return to legal segregationist policies, directly undermining decades of progress in workplace equality and racial justice.Source: ReutersDeported Venezuelans\u2019 Families Reject Trump\u2019s Claims of \u2018Terrorists\u2019What Happened: Families of Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador\u2019s notorious mega-prison are denouncing Trump\u2019s claims that they are \u201cheinous monsters.\u201d The deportees include barbers, asylum seekers, and workers, some targeted simply for having tattoos. Propaganda video footage shows them being forcibly shaved and shackled in a heavily militarized operation praised by Trump and Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele.Why It Matters: The deportations, carried out under Trump\u2019s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, may have led to wrongful detentions of non-criminals, raising alarm over human rights violations and abuse of wartime powers. Families of detainees say they were sent to a brutal prison for murderers and rapists despite having no criminal history.

Her case highlights concerns over ICE\u2019s unchecked power. While Mooney was ultimately released, many detainees are not so lucky, facing prolonged imprisonment and deportation under Trump\u2019s immigration crackdowns.Source: The GuardianUS Seeks to Deport Pro-Palestinian Georgetown University StudentWhat Happened: Trump has detained Badar Khan Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University, and is seeking to deport him over alleged ties to Hamas. Homeland Security claims Suri spread Hamas propaganda but has provided no evidence. Suri, who is married to a U.S. citizen, was arrested in Virginia and is being held in Louisiana. Georgetown University says it is unaware of any illegal activity by Suri.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing immigration enforcement to silence pro-Palestinian activists, using vague accusations and no evidence to justify deportations.

The move, which requires congressional approval for full elimination, aims to shift control over education to states. Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented attempt to gut federal oversight of public education, dismantling civil rights protections and federal support for schools nationwide.

The agency claims the rollbacks will reduce regulatory costs but Guardian analysis shows they could cause nearly 200,000 deaths in the coming years.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting pollution rules to appease corporations, ignoring the EPA\u2019s data showing billions in health benefits.

Despite the warning, the IRS sent termination letters citing performance issues, which a federal judge later called \u201ca lie.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump and Musk fabricated evidence to justify mass firings, exposing a massive employment fraud. Courts are already forcing reinstatements, and lawsuits could unravel the entire scheme.

This abrupt cut threatens farmers, school meal programs, and food security for children across the country.Why It Matters: The program successfully supported small farmers and improved nutrition for kids. Without funding, cash-strapped schools will be forced to buy cheaper, processed food from multinational corporations, and farmers who invested in infrastructure to meet school demands may go out of business.Source: The GuardianPentagon Considers Major Cuts to US Military LeadershipWhat Happened: The Pentagon is planning significant cuts to military leadership, including merging combatant commands, halting U.S. Forces Japan expansion, and reducing civilian defense jobs. Proposed changes include combining EUCOM and AFRICOM, merging NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM into AMERICOM, and eliminating key military departments such as Joint Staff training and cyber divisions.Why It Matters: Spearheaded by Musk, these cuts would undermine U.S. military operations and readiness, particularly in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific.Source: CNNSocial Security Offices Closing Nationwide Under Trump\u2019s Government CutsWhat Happened: Trump is shutting down 47 Social Security Administration offices nationwide, with 26 closures expected this year.

This is an intentional attack on the most vulnerable.Source: Associated PressNew Social Security \u201cAnti-Fraud\u201d Rule Forces More In-Person VisitsWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration will require in-person identity verification for applicants who can't prove their identity online. Additionally, beneficiaries can no longer change their bank account information over the phone. These measures, taking effect March 29-31, will significantly increase office visits and delays.Why It Matters: This exposes Trump\u2019s lies about protecting Social Security while creating massive delays for millions of seniors and disabled who depend on it. With offices shutting down, seniors and disabled Americans will have to travel absurd distances to verify their identity, worsening an already slow system.Source: CNNReinstated, but Not Back to Work: Fired Workers Linger in \u2018Limbo\u2019What Happened: Federal agencies have reinstated thousands of workers fired in Trump\u2019s purge but have immediately placed them on indefinite administrative leave. Employees, including National Park Service staff and Energy Department workers, remain in uncertainty despite court orders requiring their rehiring. Some have received back pay, but agencies cite confusion and additional pending layoffs.Why It Matters: This keeps federal employees in limbo, blocking them from resuming critical roles while Trump pushes his government purge. The result?

Reports indicate that Trump may relinquish the U.S. role as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)\u2014a position held by a four-star American general since 1950. Why It Matters: Relinquishing the SACEUR role would undermine NATO's military leadership and signal a U.S. retreat from European security at a time of heightened Russian aggression.

The move would mark a fundamental shift in NATO leadership, handing control to European allies while consolidating U.S. European and African commands.Why It Matters: Handing over NATO\u2019s top command would be a major step toward Trump\u2019s long-threatened withdrawal from the alliance.

Interagency working groups established under Biden to monitor and disrupt Russian hybrid warfare have been dismantled, and regular intelligence-sharing meetings with European allies have stopped. Why It Matters: Trump is doing everything for Russia. Halting counter-sabotage efforts leaves the U.S. and Europe wide open to Russian cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, and other covert operations.

Slaughter warned that if the president can fire independent regulators, \u201cI don\u2019t know why Jerome Powell can\u2019t be fired.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is gutting independent regulators to protect his allies and corporate donors.

Ripple also donated $5 million to Trump\\u2019s inaugural committee.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Pure corruption.

The visit coincided with the Trump family\\u2019s hotel project in Belgrade, a $500 million development backed by Jared Kushner. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s family is cashing in on U.S. foreign policy. Donald Trump Jr. is backing Vu\\u010Di\\u0107 while securing a multimillion-dollar hotel deal, blurring the line between diplomacy and personal profit.

Unauthorized DOGE has also been deleting details that would allow the public to verify its reported savings. Experts say these tactics closely resemble Tesla\\u2019s long history of manipulating safety data\\u2014omitting key context, retroactively altering statistics, and making unverifiable claims.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk is running unauthorized DOGE like Tesla\\u2014manipulating data, inflating savings, and erasing accountability.

The two commissioners argue their removal is illegal and fear it will allow Trump to weaken antitrust enforcement against Big Tech companies that donated to him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The FTC was investigating Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and X. With Slaughter and Bedoya gone, Trump can shield his Big Tech allies from scrutiny. The commissioners warn that their firing will undermine regulatory oversight and prevent whistleblowing on any pro-corporate bias at the FTC.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fired-ftc-commissioners-fear-trump-will-go-easy-big-tech-donors-rcna197128\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>ICE Contractor Fights to Keep Paying Detainees $1 a Day Despite $4 Billion Valuation</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> GEO Group, a private prison company that operates 16 ICE detention centers, is challenging a federal ruling that ordered it to pay detainees minimum wage for cleaning services. Despite record profits under Trump, GEO is fighting to overturn a decision requiring it to pay Washington state\\u2019s $16.66 hourly minimum wage instead of $1 per day.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If GEO loses, private detention centers could be forced to pay fair wages instead of exploiting detainee labor.

They warn that Trump may repeal safety rules requiring companies to report crashes involving autonomous vehicles and fear Musk\\u2019s ties will compromise the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\\u2019s oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Musk is cutting jobs at NHTSA, raising concerns that Tesla investigations will be weakened or halted.

The White House is coordinating efforts to investigate ActBlue, a major Democratic donation platform, and Arabella Advisors. Musk has fueled these attacks, while GOP lawmakers are pushing investigations into Democratic-aligned nonprofits and voter data firms. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is how authoritarian regimes consolidate power.

USAID has been gutted under Trump\\u2019s orders, with 80% of its programs canceled.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump and Musk\\u2019s takeover of USAID isn\\u2019t just about cutting foreign aid\\u2014it\\u2019s about consolidating power and eliminating oversight while ceding power to Russia and China.
