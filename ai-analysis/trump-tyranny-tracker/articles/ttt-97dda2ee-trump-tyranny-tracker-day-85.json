V\u00e1squez/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 14Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsKleptocracy, Inc.What Happened: Trump is using the presidency to enrich himself, his family, and his allies\u2014openly partnering with foreign regimes, dismantling oversight, and turning U.S. institutions into tools for personal profit. From hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his resort to suspending anti-corruption enforcement, and letting Musk slash regulatory bodies that once checked his companies, Trump\u2019s kleptocratic rule mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia and China.Why It Matters: This is not just self-dealing\u2014it\u2019s systemic corruption. Oversight mechanisms are being gutted, law enforcement is being redirected to target political enemies, and foreign interests are being rewarded for their loyalty to Trump\u2019s empire. This is what state capture looks like.Source: The AtlanticGreene Bought Market Dip Before Trump Paused Tariffs, Profiting From the RallyWhat Happened: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene bought up to $315,000 in stocks the day before and the day of Trump\u2019s surprise tariff pause that caused markets to surge. She also dumped Treasury bills ahead of the announcement, profiting as stocks like Palantir and AMD soared 19\u201321%.Why It Matters: The timing of Greene\u2019s trades\u2014just hours before Trump\u2019s announcement\u2014has sparked outrage and renewed calls for a congressional stock trading ban. With Trump allies making suspicious gains amid tariff chaos, Democrats are demanding SEC investigations into possible insider trading.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump to the USA: There Is No Rule of LawWhat Happened: Trump hosted El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele at the White House and publicly celebrated their shared refusal to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2014a Maryland father wrongfully disappeared to El Salvador. Both falsely labeled him a \u201cterrorist,\u201d despite court rulings acknowledging the deportation was unlawful and lacking evidence. Trump\u2019s officials defied a judge\u2019s enforcement order and vowed not to bring him back.Why It Matters: Trump is asserting that neither the courts nor the Constitution can limit his power\u2014not even when the regime admitted to wrongfully disappearing him to a gulag. He\u2019s normalizing lawless detentions and erasing judicial authority. Today it\u2019s Abrego Garcia. Tomorrow it could be any one of us.Source: Mother JonesWhy Trump and His Officials Are Publicly Mocking the Supreme CourtWhat Happened: Trump and his officials are defying a unanimous Supreme Court ruling to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Despite the Court ordering the government to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return, Trump and top aides like Stephen Miller are pretending they won the case\u2014arguing they are not obligated to act.Why It Matters: Trump is openly mocking the authority of the Supreme Court, refusing to comply with its rulings, and asserting the power to disappear people into foreign prisons\u2014without trial, oversight, or accountability. It\u2019s a test run for dismantling the rule of law entirely, just like in authoritarian regimes.Source: Rolling StoneTrump\u2019s $1 Billion Law Firm Deals Are the Work of His Personal LawyerWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s indicted personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn is extorting billion-dollar deals from top law firms\u2014forcing them to fund MAGA causes and change hiring practices under threat of executive orders and investigations. The deals are being cut from a D.C. steakhouse, not a government office.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the presidency to bully law firms into submission. It\u2019s a direct attack on legal independence, twisting institutions meant to uphold the rule of law into tools of political loyalty.Source: Wall Street Journal\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsPam Bondi Refuses To Answer Whether Trump Proposal To Send U.S. Citizens to Foreign Prisons Is \u2018Legal\u2019What Happened: AG Pam Bondi refused to confirm whether Trump\u2019s proposal to deport American citizens to El Salvador\u2019s notorious gulag is legal. Trump previously floated the idea, saying he would be \u201chonored\u201d to send \u201cviolent\u201d U.S. criminals abroad if El Salvador\u2019s president agreed.Why It Matters: This is chilling and we must push back. Trump\u2019s top law enforcement official won\u2019t even say if it\u2019s legal to throw Americans into foreign gulags\u2014and it\u2019s not. The refusal to rule it out shows how far this regime would be willing to go to crush dissent and bypass due process. It could happen to any of us who speak out.Source: MediaiteFEMA Denies Disaster Relief to Washington After Deadly Bomb CycloneWhat Happened: FEMA has denied Washington state\u2019s request for federal disaster relief following a deadly \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d storm in November that caused $34 million in damage. The storm killed two people, knocked out power, and severely damaged infrastructure. Gov. Bob Ferguson says the state met all eligibility criteria and will appeal.Why It Matters: This is another example of Trump weaponizing disaster relief to punish blue states. Withholding emergency aid puts lives, infrastructure, and entire communities at risk.Source: Associated PressTrump Retreats From White-Collar Criminal EnforcementWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ is ending white-collar crime enforcement\u2014dropping foreign bribery, crypto fraud, and money laundering cases. Under AG Pam Bondi, prosecutors are sidelining corporate crime to focus on Trump\u2019s political priorities. An executive order suspending the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has led to dropped charges, halted probes, and pardons for Trump allies and donors.Why It Matters: Trump has hijacked the DOJ to protect his allies and punish his enemies. By gutting enforcement of bribery and fraud laws and sidelining prosecutors, he\u2019s turning the justice system into a shield for cronies while going after the opposition. This isn\u2019t reform\u2014it\u2019s kleptocratic capture like in Russia.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s DOJ Has Frozen Police Reform Work. Advocates Fear More Abuse in Departments Across the Country.What Happened: Trump has frozen DOJ oversight of police departments across the U.S., halting progress on at least ten federal investigations into unlawful policing practices. These cases involved excessive force, racial discrimination, and unconstitutional practices.Why It Matters: Without federal intervention, local authorities\u2014many hostile to reform\u2014are left in charge of fixing abuses, raising fears of further police misconduct and abuses. Civil rights lawyers warn that the freeze greenlights lawless behavior and dismantles a key accountability tool.Source: ProPublicaSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump White House Defies Court, Bans AP From Oval Office EventWhat Happened: Despite a federal court ruling barring retaliation, Trump blocked Associated Press reporters and photographers from covering Monday\u2019s Oval Office meeting with El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele. The ban stems from AP\u2019s refusal to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a direct violation of a court order and a blatant attack on press freedom. Trump continues escalating his war on the media and rule of law\u2014punishing outlets that won\u2019t parrot propaganda and openly defying judicial authority.Source: Associated PressTrump Urges FCC Punish \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Over Critical Coverage of Ukraine and GreenlandWhat Happened: Trump called on FCC Chair Brendan Carr to impose \u201cmaximum fines and punishment\u201d on CBS for airing two \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories he didn\u2019t like\u2014one on Ukraine and one on his revived illegal Greenland annexation scheme. He claimed CBS should \u201close their license.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is textbook authoritarianism. Trump is weaponizing federal agencies to punish journalists for doing their jobs\u2014sending a clear threat to the free press: report critically, and you\u2019ll be targeted. It\u2019s not just intimidation\u2014it\u2019s a blueprint for silencing media.Source: CNNTrump announces freeze in $2.2 billion for Harvard after university rejects request for policy changesWhat Happened: The Trump regime announced it would freeze $2.2 billion in federal grants and contracts for Harvard after the university rejected demands to eliminate \u201cDEI\u201d programs, screen international students for political beliefs, and give federal authorities control over protests and admissions.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on academic freedom and the First Amendment. Harvard\u2019s refusal to comply signals a rare institutional stand against Trump\u2019s authoritarian effort to control higher education, silence dissent, and weaponize funding to enforce ideological conformity.Source: CNNTrump Seeks to Slash $9.3B from PBS, NPR, and State Department in Formal Spending Cut RequestWhat Happened: The Trump White House is sending Congress a formal rescissions request to cancel $9.3 billion in previously approved funding, targeting PBS, NPR, the State Department, USAID, and the U.S. Institute of Peace. If Congress fails to approve the request within 45 days, the funding must legally be restored.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move to defund NPR, PBS, and foreign aid isn\u2019t about \u201cefficiency\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about loyalty. This is an authoritarian purge of independent institutions. Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump and Bukele Bond Over Human Rights Abuses in Oval Office MeetingWhat Happened: In a disturbing Oval Office appearance, Trump and El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele doubled down on their migrant rendition pact\u2014refusing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Trump again floated sending American citizens to foreign prisons and mocked the Supreme Court\u2019s order to bring Abrego Garcia back.Why It Matters: This wasn\u2019t just a diplomatic photo op\u2014it was a public endorsement of authoritarianism. Trump is normalizing mass detention without due process, praising torture states, and floating ways to deport U.S. citizens. The rule of law is collapsing in real-time, and our democratic allies are being replaced with authoritarian thugs.Source: Rolling StoneCongress Demands Answers on ICE Detaining U.S. Citizens. Trump StonewallsWhat Happened: At least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have sent formal letters to Trump demanding explanations for why U.S. citizens \u2014 including Puerto Ricans and tribal members \u2014 have been detained or interrogated by immigration agents. None have received responses.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s silence reflects a broader effort to sideline congressional oversight and ignore constitutional checks. As ICE expands aggressive enforcement, Americans caught up are left without answers or accountability.Source: ProPublicaColumbia Student Detained During Naturalization Ceremony What Happened: Mohsen Mahdawi, a U.S. permanent resident and Palestinian Columbia student, was detained by DHS agents\u2014two masked\u2014during his naturalization interview in Vermont. His lawyers say the arrest is direct retaliation for his role in campus protests against the Israel-Gaza war.Why It Matters: Vermont lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, called the detention \u201cimmoral, inhumane and illegal.\u201d A judge has temporarily blocked the deportation. Trump is using international students as a test case and this will be expanded to all students.Source: NBC NewsThe Little-Known Bureaucrats Tearing Through American UniversitiesWhat Happened: A Trump task force is using frozen federal funding to force ideological reforms on universities. While framed as an effort to combat antisemitism, the group is targeting admissions, hiring, \u201cDEI\u201d programs, and protest policies. Harvard and Columbia alone face over $11 billion in suspended funds.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just about antisemitism\u2014it\u2019s a MAGA-driven assault on academic freedom. The task force is weaponizing federal funding and civil rights law to impose political loyalty tests and force cultural and academic conformity in universities, all without congressional oversight. It\u2019s a blueprint for authoritarian control over education.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchIRS chief information officer announces resignation on eve of tax-filing dayWhat Happened: Rajiv Uppal, Chief Information Officer at the IRS, announced his resignation just one day before the April 15 tax-filing deadline. Uppal\u2019s departure follows a wave of high-level resignations at the agency amid a massive purge.Why It Matters: Uppal\u2019s exit creates a tech leadership void at the height of tax season. As cyber threats grow and IRS systems face mounting pressure, the agency is losing critical expertise when stability and security are most needed.Source: ReutersWhite House Moves to Gut State Department, Slash UN and NATO FundingWhat Happened: Trump has proposed cutting the State Department\u2019s budget by nearly 50%, closing overseas diplomatic missions, and eliminating funding for most international organizations\u2014including the United Nations, its agencies, and NATO headquarters.Why It Matters: This is an aggressive attempt to dismantle America\u2019s diplomatic infrastructure and retreat from global leadership. Slashing funding to NATO and the UN while cozying up to autocrats signals the death of U.S. multilateralism\u2014and aligns with Trump\u2019s isolationist, authoritarian agenda. The cuts will cede global influence to Russia and China.Source: Associated PressU.S. Measles Outbreak Surpasses 700 Cases as CDC Scrambles to RespondWhat Happened: The CDC confirmed over 700 measles cases so far in 2025, with 79 hospitalizations and at least 2 child deaths in Texas. Why It Matters: This outbreak is a direct result of Trump\u2019s health department gutting the CDC and putting vaccine conspiracist RFK Jr. in charge. Public health infrastructure was dismantled\u2014and now kids are dying from a disease that was nearly eradicated.Source: USA TodayTrump\u2019s HHS Cuts Threaten Collapse of U.S. Health Systems, Staff WarnWhat Happened: After mass layoffs at HHS, critical IT systems are collapsing. Cybersecurity, contract renewals, and health data protections are in disarray. The agency\u2019s cyber nerve center could go dark by June, with its lease already set to end by December 31.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s purge of IT and cybersecurity staff\u2014led by Musk and Palantir-connected operatives\u2014has crippled the digital backbone at HHS. Public health data, clinical trials, drug testing info, and sensitive patient records are now at risk of exposure or attack. This is bureaucratic sabotage on a catastrophic scale.Source: WIREDFederal Freeze Halts Tribal Climate Projects, Threatens Lives and InfrastructureWhat Happened: Trump froze $350 million in federal funding earmarked for over 22 tribal and nonprofit-led infrastructure projects across the U.S., including Alaska. These funds, part of the EPA's Community Change Grants under Biden\u2019s climate policy, were aimed at housing renovations, solar installations, and climate-resilience infrastructure. Why It Matters: Vulnerable Native communities now face mounting climate threats like erosion and permafrost thaw without the promised federal support. The freeze halts life-saving upgrades and exposes these communities to worsening environmental hazards.Source: NPRCollege financial aid hit with glitches, delays due to federal staffing cutsWhat Happened: After Trump laid off over 1,300 Education Department employees, federal student aid systems are faltering. Universities report major delays accessing student records, calculating aid packages, and disbursing Pell Grants and loans. Some platforms have crashed multiple times, and support teams are unresponsive or overwhelmed.Why It Matters: These cuts gut the backbone of America\u2019s $1.6 trillion student aid system. Low-income students risk losing access to timely help, and colleges are left in limbo. Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cefficiency\u201d is setting up a FAFSA disaster\u2014just as fall enrollment looms.Source: Washington PostTrump Cancels $3 Billion Climate-Friendly Farming ProgramWhat Happened: The USDA announced it has canceled the Biden-era Partnership for Climate-Smart Commodities, a $3 billion initiative supporting carbon-reducing farming practices. Trump claimed the program was \u201cmismanaged,\u201d directing too little money to farmers and too much to overhead. Why It Matters: This is another major climate rollback\u2014gutting sustainable farming support as climate threats intensify. It further reiterates Trump\u2019s return to anti-science, pro-industry rule, sidelining environmental progress to serve his deregulatory agenda.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchEU issues US-bound staff with burner phones over spying fearsWhat Happened: The European Commission considers the United States a surveillance threat\u2014on par with China and Russia. Staff traveling to Washington for IMF and World Bank meetings have been issued burner phones and stripped-down laptops due to fears the Trump regime could spy on their devices. Officials have also been advised to shut off phones at the U.S. border and store them in anti-surveillance sleeves.Why It Matters: Trump has caused a collapse in transatlantic trust. Just 85 days into his second term, the U.S. is being treated by allies as a hostile surveillance state. The move underscores how Trump\u2019s embrace of authoritarian tactics, attacks on Europe, and disregard for norms has shattered global confidence in the U.S. as a trustworthy partner.Source: Financial Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Keeps Lying Ukraine Started the War With RussiaWhat Happened: Trump again lied and blamed Ukraine for starting Russia\u2019s genocidal full-scale war. In a meeting with El Salvador\u2019s President, Trump mocked Zelenskyy, whitewashed Russian aggression, and repeated disinformation.Why It Matters: Predictably, Trump continues echoing Kremlin propaganda\u2014gaslighting Americans, vilifying a U.S. ally, and defending a genocidal war criminal and terrorist state. But what\u2019s reprehensible is the silence from Republicans who once strongly backed Ukraine. Their capitulation reiterates how fully Trump has captured the party.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Moves to Put New Tariffs on Computer Chips and DrugsWhat Happened: Trump launched national security investigations into imported semiconductors and pharmaceuticals \u2014 a move expected to lead to new tariffs. Trump invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, the same statute he used in 2018 to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum. Why It Matters: Targeting chips and medicine under the guise of national security, Trump\u2019s tariffs risk disrupting global supply chains, spiking prices, and deepening market chaos\u2014while giving him leverage to reward corporate allies with exemptions.Source: New York TimesThe Dollar Keeps Falling as Its \u2018Safe Haven\u2019 Status Is QuestionedWhat Happened: The U.S. dollar has dropped 8% this year and hit a three-year low following Trump\u2019s tariffs. Once considered the world\u2019s safest asset, the dollar is now being dumped by investors and central banks who no longer trust its stability amid trade chaos.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just economic turbulence\u2014it\u2019s a foundational shift. Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs and economic nationalism are eroding faith in the dollar as the global reserve currency, rattling markets, increasing recession fears, and threatening the central role of U.S. financial power worldwide.Source: New York TimesGoldman Sachs CEO Warns Trump\u2019s Tariffs Are Pushing U.S. Toward RecessionWhat Happened: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned investors that the likelihood of a U.S. recession has \u201cincreased\u201d due to Trump\u2019s tariffs. He said the tariffs, along with fears of a prolonged trade war, are injecting volatility and uncertainty into global markets and making it harder for businesses to plan ahead.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies are destabilizing the global economy while putting U.S. growth at risk\u2014despite Goldman reporting a record quarter driven by market chaos. Solomon\u2019s remarks suggest that behind the gains, Wall Street is bracing for a downturn.Source: The GuardianFear of unemployment jumps to highest level since the pandemicWhat Happened: A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey shows Americans now see a 44% chance of rising unemployment in the next year \u2014 the highest level of job insecurity since April 2020. Fears of personal job loss also jumped to a 12-month high.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic tariff insanity and economic unpredictability are shaking confidence in the labor market. Consumer pessimism will curb spending and investment, accelerating a downturn. Inflation fears are also on the rise, compounding the threat of a recession.Source: CNN\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News4/19- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501U.S. businesses sue to block Trump tariffs, say trade deficits are not an emergencyWhat Happened: Five small businesses filed a lawsuit against Trump to block his latest wave of tariffs, arguing he illegally invoked emergency powers under IEEPA to bypass Congress. The plaintiffs say Trump\u2019s claim that trade deficits are an \u201cemergency\u201d is baseless and that the tariffs are crushing their operations.Source: CNBCEducation Department Sued Over Mass Layoffs and Research CutsWhat Happened: The American Education Research Association filed a lawsuit against the Education Department over the decimation of its research arm, the Institute of Education Sciences. Following DOGE\u2019s intervention, 90% of IES staff were terminated and educational research contracts were abruptly canceled.Source: NBC NewsCourt Temporarily Blocks Trump\u2019s Shuttering of Migrant Entry ProgramWhat Happened: A federal judge in Boston halted Trump\u2019s plan to terminate a Biden-era program that granted temporary legal entry and work permits to migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Haiti. Source: New York TimesHarvard says it will not \u2018yield\u2019 to Trump demands over $9bn in funding cutsWhat Happened: Harvard University publicly rejected sweeping demands from Trump threatening $9 billion in federal funding unless the school banned masks, dismantled \u201cDEI\u201d programs, policed faculty activism, and surveilled international students. In a letter to the Harvard community, President Alan Garber declared the university would \u201cnot surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201dSource: The Guardian\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers4/19 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action$1 billion+ \u2014 Combined legal contracts extorted by Trump via Boris Epshteyn$11 billion+ \u2014 Federal funding frozen across Harvard and Columbia alone$2.2 billion \u2014 Frozen federal funds for Harvard$1.6 trillion \u2014 Value of the federal student loan system facing disruption90% \u2014 Staff purged from the Education Department\u2019s research division60 \u2014 Universities warned by the Education Department over civil rights investigations$9.3 billion \u2014 Proposed cuts to PBS, NPR, and State Department$3 billion \u2014 Canceled USDA climate-smart farming initiative$350 million \u2014 Tribal infrastructure funding frozen22 \u2014 Tribes and nonprofits impacted by federal funding freeze700+ \u2014 Measles cases in 2025 amid CDC gutting44% \u2014 Americans now believe unemployment will rise in the next year19\u201321% \u2014 Gains in Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s stock holdings after Trump tariff pause$8 billion \u2014 Approximate drop in dollar value this year\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump\u2019s Next Moves on Social Security & Medicare \u2014 After slashing the Social Security Administration\u2019s workforce, is Trump laying the groundwork to go after the benefits themselves?

Or will MAGA-aligned legal compliance become the norm?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Dictators Inc \u2014 Trump\u2019s meeting with El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian president wasn\u2019t diplomacy\u2014it was a celebration of dictatorship. Together, they mocked court orders, praised mass incarceration, and endorsed deporting U.S. citizens to foreign gulags. The Rule of Law Is Under Attack \u2014 From ignoring the Supreme Court to threatening to deport U.S. citizens and coercing universities, Trump is erasing judicial authority and replacing it with raw executive power.Authoritarian Playbook \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t just cracking down on dissent\u2014he\u2019s restructuring institutions to enforce ideological loyalty and silence opposition.Public Institutions Are Being Hollowed Out \u2014 From the IRS to HHS, DOE, and CDC, vital agencies are being gutted\u2014sabotaging public services, health, science, education, and economic security.Resistance Is Rising \u2014 From the courts to campuses, institutions are starting to fight back\u2014but they need public pressure, media attention, and coordinated legal action to succeed.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

From hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his resort to suspending anti-corruption enforcement, and letting Musk slash regulatory bodies that once checked his companies, Trump\u2019s kleptocratic rule mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia and China.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> This is not just self-dealing\u2014it\u2019s systemic corruption. Oversight mechanisms are being gutted, law enforcement is being redirected to target political enemies, and foreign interests are being rewarded for their loyalty to Trump\u2019s empire.

From hosting the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his resort to suspending anti-corruption enforcement, and letting Musk slash regulatory bodies that once checked his companies, Trump\\u2019s kleptocratic rule mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia and China.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is not just self-dealing\\u2014it\\u2019s systemic corruption. Oversight mechanisms are being gutted, law enforcement is being redirected to target political enemies, and foreign interests are being rewarded for their loyalty to Trump\\u2019s empire. This is what state capture looks like.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-kleptocracy-autocracy-inc/682281/\\\\\\\">The Atlantic</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Greene Bought Market Dip Before Trump Paused Tariffs, Profiting From the Rally</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene bought up to $315,000 in stocks the day before and the day of Trump\\u2019s surprise tariff pause that caused markets to surge. She also dumped Treasury bills ahead of the announcement, profiting as stocks like Palantir and AMD soared 19\\u201321%.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The timing of Greene\\u2019s trades\\u2014just hours before Trump\\u2019s announcement\\u2014has sparked outrage and renewed calls for a congressional stock trading ban.

Both falsely labeled him a \\u201Cterrorist,\\u201D despite court rulings acknowledging the deportation was unlawful and lacking evidence. Trump\\u2019s officials defied a judge\\u2019s enforcement order and vowed not to bring him back.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is asserting that neither the courts nor the Constitution can limit his power\\u2014not even when the regime admitted to wrongfully disappearing him to a gulag.

Despite the Court ordering the government to \\u201Cfacilitate\\u201D his return, Trump and top aides like Stephen Miller are pretending they won the case\\u2014arguing they are not obligated to act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly mocking the authority of the Supreme Court, refusing to comply with its rulings, and asserting the power to disappear people into foreign prisons\\u2014without trial, oversight, or accountability. It\\u2019s a test run for dismantling the rule of law entirely, just like in authoritarian regimes.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-mocking-supreme-court-1235317269/\\\\\\\">Rolling Stone</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s $1 Billion Law Firm Deals Are the Work of His Personal Lawyer</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s indicted personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn is extorting billion-dollar deals from top law firms\\u2014forcing them to fund MAGA causes and change hiring practices under threat of executive orders and investigations. The deals are being cut from a D.C. steakhouse, not a government office.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the presidency to bully law firms into submission.

Trump previously floated the idea, saying he would be \\u201Chonored\\u201D to send \\u201Cviolent\\u201D U.S. criminals abroad if El Salvador\\u2019s president agreed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is chilling and we must push back.

The storm killed two people, knocked out power, and severely damaged infrastructure. Gov. Bob Ferguson says the state met all eligibility criteria and will appeal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another example of Trump weaponizing disaster relief to punish blue states.

Under AG Pam Bondi, prosecutors are sidelining corporate crime to focus on Trump\\u2019s political priorities. An executive order suspending the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has led to dropped charges, halted probes, and pardons for Trump allies and donors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has hijacked the DOJ to protect his allies and punish his enemies. By gutting enforcement of bribery and fraud laws and sidelining prosecutors, he\\u2019s turning the justice system into a shield for cronies while going after the opposition.

These cases involved excessive force, racial discrimination, and unconstitutional practices.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Without federal intervention, local authorities\\u2014many hostile to reform\\u2014are left in charge of fixing abuses, raising fears of further police misconduct and abuses.

The ban stems from AP\\u2019s refusal to comply with Trump\\u2019s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \\u201CGulf of America.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct violation of a court order and a blatant attack on press freedom.

Harvard and Columbia alone face over $11 billion in suspended funds.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This isn\\u2019t just about antisemitism\\u2014it\\u2019s a MAGA-driven assault on academic freedom.

Uppal\\u2019s departure follows a wave of high-level resignations at the agency amid a massive purge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Uppal\\u2019s exit creates a tech leadership void at the height of tax season.

Slashing funding to NATO and the UN while cozying up to autocrats signals the death of U.S. multilateralism\\u2014and aligns with Trump\\u2019s isolationist, authoritarian agenda.

The agency\\u2019s cyber nerve center could go dark by June, with its lease already set to end by December 31.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s purge of IT and cybersecurity staff\\u2014led by Musk and Palantir-connected operatives\\u2014has crippled the digital backbone at HHS. Public health data, clinical trials, drug testing info, and sensitive patient records are now at risk of exposure or attack.

These funds, part of the EPA's Community Change Grants under Biden\\u2019s climate policy, were aimed at housing renovations, solar installations, and climate-resilience infrastructure. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Vulnerable Native communities now face mounting climate threats like erosion and permafrost thaw without the promised federal support.

Universities report major delays accessing student records, calculating aid packages, and disbursing Pell Grants and loans. Some platforms have crashed multiple times, and support teams are unresponsive or overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These cuts gut the backbone of America\\u2019s $1.6 trillion student aid system. Low-income students risk losing access to timely help, and colleges are left in limbo.

Officials have also been advised to shut off phones at the U.S. border and store them in anti-surveillance sleeves.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has caused a collapse in transatlantic trust. Just 85 days into his second term, the U.S. is being treated by allies as a hostile surveillance state.
