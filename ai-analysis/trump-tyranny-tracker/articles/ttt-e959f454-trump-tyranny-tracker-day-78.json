REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 7Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsFormer clerk for judge who tossed Trump's classified docs case now in senior DOJ positionWhat Happened: Christopher-James DeLorenz, former law clerk to Judge Aileen Cannon\u2014who controversially dismissed Trump\u2019s classified documents case\u2014has been appointed as Counsel in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump\u2019s former defense lawyer.Why It Matters: The appointment reiterates a politicized Justice Department, as Trump installs loyalists and former legal defenders in top roles\u2014undermining the independence of federal prosecutions and turning the DOJ into a weapon for personal and political retribution.Source: ABC News\u2018Oligarchy\u2019: Trump Exempts Big Oil Donors from Tariffs PackageWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s sweeping 10% universal tariffs unveiled Wednesday exempt many fossil fuel products\u2014including LNG imports, Canadian crude, and petrochemical inputs. The carveout came after the fossil fuel industry contributed $96 million to Trump\u2019s re-election effort.Why It Matters: Trump continues to be loyal to Big Oil amid global economic turmoil triggered by Trump\u2019s erratic policies. Consumer prices are expected to rise, but oil donors benefit\u2014highlighting an \u201coligarchic\u201d system where political access yields economic protection.Source: The GuardianTrump Family\u2019s Cash Registers Ring as Financial Meltdown Plays OutWhat Happened: As global markets plummeted\u2014losing over $5 trillion after Trump\u2019s sweeping new tariffs\u2014Trump spent the weekend cashing in and playing golf at his Florida resorts. While the economy buckled, the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament rolled on at Trump National Doral while at Mar-a-Lago Trump hosted a $1 million-a-head donor dinner.Why It Matters: As Trump\u2019s policies trigger market chaos and layoffs, his family resorts thrive with foreign dignitaries and billionaire donors. Trump has turned the presidency into a personal cash machine\u2014fueling democratic decay through pay-to-play politics.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsU.S. Admiral at NATO Fired in Trump\u2019s Expanding National Security PurgeWhat Happened: Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. representative to NATO\u2019s Military Committee, was fired without explanation\u2014part of a widening Trump purge targeting high-ranking military and national security officials.Why It Matters: Trump's removal of top defense officials signals a dangerous consolidation of power, undermining NATO coordination and weakening U.S. military independence. It\u2019s part of a broader authoritarian shift, as Trump sidelines dissent and centralizes control.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udea8DOGE Plans IRS \u201cHackathon\u201d to Build Mega API, Raising Fears Over Taxpayer Data AccessWhat Happened: Musk is planning a weeklong hackathon at the IRS to build a \u201cmega API\u201d that would grant sweeping access to all taxpayer data. IRS staff say Musk operatives want to \u201crip up the old systems\u201d and fast-track a cloud-based interface. Software firm Palantir is being discussed as a likely third-party partner.Why It Matters: A centralized IRS API would hand Musk and his operatives\u2014and even private firms\u2014unchecked access to Americans\u2019 most sensitive financial data. Experts warn it\u2019s a dangerous consolidation of power, and may create an open backdoor into Social Security numbers, addresses, and tax records with no oversight.Source: WIREDIn Trump\u2019s Second Term, Retribution Comes in Many FormsWhat Happened: Since returning to office, Trump has launched an expansive and aggressive campaign of retribution targeting political opponents, law firms, universities, corporations, and media outlets \u2014 often bypassing the courts in favor of executive orders, regulations, and intimidation tactics.Why It Matters: Trump is consolidating power by bullying institutions into submission, bypassing courts and due process. This marks a dangerous turn toward authoritarianism, where fear and punishment replace legal norms and democratic checks.Source: New York TimesTrump Threatens to Block Congress From Taking Control of TariffsWhat Happened: Trump vowed to veto bipartisan legislation that would limit his authority over tariffs. The \u201cTrade Review Act of 2025\u201d would require congressional approval for tariffs to become permanent. At least seven Republican senators back the bill, citing concerns over economic impact and executive overreach.Why It Matters: The fight over tariff power underscores a deeper crisis: Trump increasingly views Congress as irrelevant\u2014expecting rubber-stamp obedience, not oversight.Source: Rolling StoneAnother Law Firm Braces for Possible Blowback From TrumpWhat Happened: After previously refusing to represent Trump, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft is now being strong-armed by the White House to offer tens of millions in pro bono legal work for Trump-approved causes\u2014or face a punishing executive order. Other firms have already capitulated.Why It Matters: This is blunt political extortion. Trump is using the power of the presidency to coerce private law firms into compliance, punishing those deemed disloyal. It\u2019s a tactic straight from the authoritarian playbook\u2014undermining the rule of law and echoing legal crackdowns seen in dictatorships.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump DOJ Intimidates Whistleblower Ahead of TestimonyWhat Happened: Liz Oyer, the former U.S. pardon attorney fired after opposing the restoration of gun rights to Mel Gibson, says the Trump regime sent armed U.S. Marshals to her home\u2014where her teenage child was alone\u2014just days before she was scheduled to testify in a \u201cshadow\u201d congressional hearing. The marshals were directed to hand-deliver a letter warning her not to discuss privileged information.Why It Matters: This is blatant intimidation of a protected whistleblower. It highlights Trump\u2019s DOJ weaponizing law enforcement to silence internal dissent\u2014turning federal power into a tool of intimidation.Source: NBC NewsElon Musk\u2019s Secret Weapon: the US Marshals ServiceWhat Happened: Members of Musk\u2019s private security team were quietly deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service in February, granting them federal law enforcement powers. Reports suggest these deputies helped Musk raid a federal agency and, in January, pressured judges to release January 6 insurrectionists and rioters faster.Why It Matters: Handing policing powers to Musk\u2019s private actors is a dangerous move\u2014collapsing the wall between public authority and private profit. Combined with the U.S. Marshals\u2019 authoritarian tactics, it signals a disturbing shift toward a law enforcement regime answerable not to the public, but to the state.Source: Mother JonesTrump Cuts $325 Million in FEMA Disaster Aid to New YorkWhat Happened: FEMA has slashed over $300 million in disaster prevention funds to New York State, canceling key flood mitigation projects across NYC\u2014including stormwater infrastructure and coastal protections in areas devastated by Hurricanes Sandy and Ida.Why It Matters: The cuts eliminate life-saving climate resiliency projects in low-income, flood-prone neighborhoods\u2014many in Democratic-led states. Officials warn the move puts thousands at risk as Trump dismantles FEMA\u2019s BRIC program in what is political retribution. Source: New York TimesWhen It Comes to D.E.I. and ICE, Trump Is Using Federal Grants as LeverageWhat Happened: Trump is using federal grants as leverage to force cities and states to comply with its extremist anti-immigration and anti-DEI agenda. The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing and rescinding billions in funding to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE or maintain diversity and equity programs.Why It Matters: Trump is punishing states and localities\u2014especially sanctuary cities\u2014by weaponizing disaster relief, public safety, and anti-terrorism funding. This coercive use of federal power undermines local governance and endangers millions, turning financial lifelines into tools of political enforcement.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News\ud83d\udea8The Shocking Far-Right Agenda Behind the Facial Recognition Tech Used by ICE and the FBIWhat Happened: Thousands of internal documents reveal that Clearview AI\u2014used by ICE and the FBI\u2014was created with a far-right agenda to target immigrants, people of color, and left-leaning individuals. Trump has now embedded this surveillance tool into mass deportation efforts, as oversight collapses and extremist allies take key federal posts.Why It Matters: Clearview\u2019s weaponization of facial recognition represents a dangerous fusion of tech, ideology, and authoritarian power\u2014enabling the Trump regime to pursue political retribution and mass surveillance without legal guardrails\u2014 like in Russia and China.Source: Mother JonesTrump in early stages of planning a June military parade in Washington, DCWhat Happened: Trump is planning a military parade in Washington, DC, on June 14\u2014marking the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and his birthday. Early plans include a procession from the Pentagon to the White House with armored vehicles, military displays, and the Golden Knights parachute team.Why It Matters: Trump wants to be like Putin. The planned military parade would mimic authoritarian displays of \u201cpower\u201d seen in Russia and North Korea. Meanwhile, D.C. officials warn it could damage city infrastructure and send the wrong message as federal workers face mass layoffs. Trump tried a similar parade in 2018\u2014and was stopped.Source: CNNUS Student Journalists Go Dark Fearing Trump Crusade Against Pro-Palestinian SpeechWhat Happened: Student journalists across the country are pulling bylines, quitting publications, and requesting story takedowns as Trump cracks down on pro-Palestinian activism. The fear intensified after the ICE detention of Tufts graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who had written a pro-Palestinian op-ed. Arrests of nearly a dozen international students since March have triggered panic in college newsrooms.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is gutting campus free speech. Even U.S. citizens are going silent out of fear, while student journalists self-censor to avoid legal or career blowback. Editors are being forced to choose between truth and safety leading to a full-scale erosion of dissent and journalism. Compliance only strengthens dictators.Source: The GuardianTrump on possibility of sending American inmates to El Salvador prison: \u2018I love that\u2019What Happened: Trump said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to send violent American inmates to El Salvador\u2019s mega-prison, calling it a cost-saving measure. He floated the idea aboard Air Force One, saying he\u2019d discuss it with Salvadoran President Bukele but needed to \u201ccheck what the law says.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is the second time Trump has floated sending U.S. prisoners to El Salvador\u2014an unconstitutional idea with authoritarian overtones. Believe him: if unchecked, he will redefine \"violent crime\" to target dissent and weaponize gulag incarceration against critics.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsU.S. sent 238 migrants to Salvadoran mega-prison; documents indicate most have no apparent criminal recordsWhat Happened: Trump \u201cdeported\u201d 238 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador\u2019s infamous CECOT prison. Internal documents reveal most had no criminal convictions or charges, including asylum seekers like Andry Hernandez Romero, a makeup artist who vanished from U.S. custody.Why It Matters: Legal asylum seekers are being shipped off to a foreign gulag without due process. The regime lied about the nature of the deportations\u2014this is not law enforcement, it\u2019s forced disappearance.Source: CBS News (60 Minutes)As Trump cracks down on immigration, U.S. citizens are among those snaredWhat Happened: At least 7 U.S. citizens \u2014 including a 10-year-old girl with a brain tumor \u2014 have been wrongfully detained, deported, or threatened with removal under Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Cases include citizens seized without probable cause and expelled to Mexico, with immigration officials reportedly bypassing legal safeguards.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s lawless operation is ensnaring U.S. citizens, raising alarms about civil liberties and due process as oversight is dismantled and enforcement accelerates without guardrails.Source: The Washington PostFeds Are Revoking Student Visas Without Notifying CollegesWhat Happened: Dozens of U.S. colleges are discovering that federal authorities have quietly revoked international student visas\u2014often without warning or explanation. Universities only learned of the terminations after checking the SEVIS federal database.Why It Matters: The sudden, opaque visa revocations are sowing fear across campuses. Students are being detained without warning, while others live in uncertainty. This arbitrary purge undermines trust in the visa system and is already chilling speech\u2014especially among international students. It\u2019s targeted, chaotic, and meant to intimidate.Source: Washington PostTrump to Roll Back Array of Gun Control MeasuresWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi is expected to eliminate key Biden-era gun control policies, including a \u201czero tolerance\u201d program targeting law-breaking gun dealers. The regime also plans to rescind bans on pistol braces and background checks for private gun sales, amid growing chaos at the ATF.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous rollback of federal gun safety efforts, that will again open the floodgates for unregulated firearm sales. As gun violence remains a national crisis, this will endanger more Americans and undo years of progress on public safety.Source: New York TimesTrump Guts Federal Violence Prevention Programs, Experts Warn of Increased AttacksWhat Happened: Trump has gutted federal efforts to prevent gun violence, domestic terrorism, and hate crimes. Entire programs at the CDC, DHS, and HHS have been dismantled, including the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, the T2V database, and the federal school safety clearinghouse.Why It Matters: Experts warn these cuts will have devastating consequences. Without data or early intervention tools, officials fear rising school and workplace shootings, hate crimes, and even attacks against government leaders. The shutdown of research arms means policymaking will rely on \u201chunches\u201d instead of science.Source: The GuardianUS Bishops Halt Aid Partnerships with Government Due to Funding CutsWhat Happened: The US Conference of Catholic Bishops is ending its decades-long partnership with the federal government on refugee and children's services after the Trump administration abruptly halted resettlement funding. A lawsuit by the bishops was dismissed, with a judge ruling it belonged in a separate claims court.Why It Matters: The abrupt end to a historic church-state partnership means fewer services for vulnerable families\u2014and drew condemnation from Pope Francis over Trump\u2019s lawless mass deportation operation.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDOGE slashes key housing inspection contract, putting some low-income families at riskWhat Happened: Trump terminated a federal contract responsible for inspecting thousands of low-income and public housing units for gas leaks, fire hazards, and other life-threatening issues. Why It Matters: The abrupt cancellation threatens legally required safety inspections, especially at high-risk properties, leaving low-income families and vulnerable tenants\u2014including seniors\u2014exposed to hazardous living conditions with no clear plan for replacement oversight.Source: ABC NewsSocial Security Website Keeps Crashing, as DOGE Demands Cuts to IT StaffWhat Happened: The Social Security website has repeatedly crashed, disrupting access for millions. The outages are tied to Musk-led cuts, which slashed IT staff and rushed out untested software.Why It Matters: The outages are plunging 73 million Americans\u2014especially SSI recipients\u2014into chaos. False messages about cut-off benefits sparked panic, and Musk\u2019s push to purge SSA\u2019s tech staff risks even more failures. Vulnerable groups are being abandoned as essential systems collapse.Source: Washington Post'Wi-Fi Keeps Going Down': Donald Trump's Return-to-Office Mandate Is Going TerriblyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s order forcing federal employees back to the office\u2014enforced by Musk has led to widespread dysfunction. Workers report inadequate internet, overcrowded offices, missing supplies, and declining morale. Many now commute long distances just to take Zoom calls in chaotic environments.Why It Matters: Instead of boosting efficiency, the mandate has crippled agency operations, slashed productivity, and degraded public services\u2014revealing a hollow policy driven more by optics than functionality.Source: WIREDTrump Said Cuts Wouldn\u2019t Affect Public Safety. Then He Fired Hundreds of Workers Who Help Fight WildfiresWhat Happened: Despite promising to protect public safety roles, Trump\u2019s February purge included hundreds of red-card-certified Forest Service workers\u2014trained staff essential to wildfire support and prevention. Their termination has severely weakened the agency\u2019s firefighting capacity ahead of a potentially catastrophic 2025 fire season.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass firing of red-carded wildfire support staff has gutted U.S. fire preparedness. Training is canceled, hiring is frozen, and key logistics systems are at risk\u2014leaving frontline crews dangerously unsupported ahead of fire season.Source: ProPublicaTrump Admin Insider Blasts DOGE\u2019s Government-Slashing OperationWhat Happened: Merici Vinton, a former U.S. Digital Service official, described Musk and his operatives as a \u201cwrecking ball.\u201d Vinton says Musk\u2019s operatives rapidly gutted her agency\u2014formerly focused on IT and tax reform\u2014replacing collaboration with chaos. DOGE staff\u2014 unvetted, unqualified, and operating in secret, conducted brief interviews to decide the fate of longtime federal workers.Why It Matters: Vinton says Musk isn\u2019t making government more efficient\u2014he\u2019s gutting it. Programs like Direct File and the child tax credit may never recover. The chaos and secrecy of Musk\u2019s infiltration have paralyzed federal agencies, while thousands brace for more layoffs. This isn\u2019t reform\u2014it\u2019s demolition.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUS in Direct Nuclear Talks With Iran, Trump SaysWhat Happened: Trump announced the U.S. will hold direct nuclear talks with Iran on Saturday, calling it a \u201cvery big meeting\u201d and warning it would be a \u201cvery bad day for Iran\u201d if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iran\u2019s foreign minister confirmed the talks, set to take place in Oman, though he characterized them as \u201cindirect\u201d and warned the ball is \u201cin America\u2019s court.\u201dWhy It Matters: The talks mark a dramatic reversal after years of Trump rhetoric and his 2016 exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal. Now, after threatening military action, Trump is pushing for negotiations\u2014highlighting the GOP\u2019s hypocrisy. Republicans once torched diplomacy with Iran and now Trump seeks a deal even as Iran accelerates uranium enrichment.Source: BBC NewsEuropean and Asian Defense Stocks Surge Amid Global Distrust of U.S. AlliancesWhat Happened: Defense stocks in Europe and Asia are significantly outperforming their U.S. counterparts in 2025, driven by surging defense budgets and a strategic pivot away from reliance on U.S. weapons. Trump\u2019s alignment with Russia and abandonment of Ukraine have shattered trust among allies, leading countries to boost domestic production or turn to partners like South Korea.Why It Matters: The shift signals collapsing trust in the U.S. as a reliable ally. With Trump undermining NATO and turning arms support into political leverage, nations are racing to reduce their dependence on Washington. The result: record defense spending, a booming European and Asian weapons industry, and a long-term transformation of the global military landscape.Source: CNBC\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussian Killing of Ukrainian Children Shows Limits of Trump\u2019s Peace EffortsWhat Happened: A Russian missile strike on Kryviy Rih on Friday killed nine children and 11 adults, marking the deadliest single attack on children since the war began in 2022, according to the UN. Funerals were held Monday, as residents grieved at the playground where the missile hit.Why It Matters: The massacre shows Trump never wanted to negotiate peace and his plan is a sham. While Ukraine upheld a cease-fire, Russia continues its brutal attacks\u2014including the missile strike on a playground that killed nine children. Trump has shown zero concern, refused to condemn Putin, and shielded Russia from new tariffs. His loyalty to Moscow is unwavering\u2014no matter how many Ukrainian children die.Source: Wall Street Journal\u2696\ufe0f Supreme Court WatchSupreme Court Lifts Order Blocking Deportations to El SalvadorWhat Happened: In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. The decision reversed a lower court\u2019s injunction and greenlit Trump\u2019s controversial use of a wartime law. However, the Court ruled that deportees must receive notice and the chance to challenge their removal in a Texas court.Source: Wall Street JournalUS Supreme Court temporarily blocks order to return migrant deported to El Salvador in errorWhat Happened: The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court\u2019s order requiring Trump to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legally residing Salvadoran migrant deported in error. The government admitted the mistake.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Tariffs Escalate Tensions with Beijing as China Vows to 'Fight to the End'What Happened: China\u2019s Commerce Ministry issued a sharp rebuke to Trump\u2019s threat to raise tariffs by 50% on Chinese imports if Beijing does not roll back its own recently imposed 34% duties on American goods. Calling Trump\u2019s move \u201ca mistake on top of a mistake,\u201d Beijing vowed to retaliate and \u201cfight to the end.\u201dWhy It Matters: This latest escalation comes amid an already collapsing global trade environment, with markets in turmoil and recession fears rising. China\u2019s announcement reiterates it will not back down to Trump, setting the stage for a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Source: CNBCTrump Says EU Must Buy $350B of US Energy to Get Tariff ReliefWhat Happened: Trump rejected the European Union\u2019s offer of \u201czero-for-zero\u201d tariffs on cars and industrial goods, insisting that the bloc must commit to purchasing $350 billion in U.S. energy\u2014primarily liquefied natural gas\u2014to close the trade deficit. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff demands are destabilizing global markets and straining U.S. alliances. By tying relief to $350B in EU energy purchases and attacking European safety standards, he\u2019s trying to bully allies into lopsided, politically motivated deals\u2014pushing for a transatlantic economic war.Source: PoliticoJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump tariffs will boost inflation, slow an already weakening U.S. economyWhat Happened: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs will drive up inflation and further slow an already weakening U.S. economy. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said rising input costs and pressure on domestic supply could trigger higher prices across the board.Why It Matters: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is the first major Wall Street figure to break with Trump on tariffs, warning they could spark a recession. Once supportive, Dimon now says the plan adds \u201cone large additional straw on the camel\u2019s back\u201d amid mounting economic uncertainty.Source: NBC NewsStocks fall after day of wild swings as markets digest Trump's tariff realityWhat Happened: U.S. stocks ended lower after a chaotic day triggered by Trump\u2019s tariffs and worries of a global recession. False rumors of a pause briefly buoyed markets before the White House denied them. The Dow fell 350 points, and the S&P dipped into bear market territory after global markets plunged overnight.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy, thuggish bullying, and refusal to back down have shaken investor confidence and erased trillions in market value\u2014marking the steepest early-term losses for any U.S. president since WWII.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News4/19- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501Mother and Three Kids Released by ICE After Protests from US \u2018Border Czar\u2019s\u2019 HometownWhat Happened: A mother and her three children were detained by ICE agents during a raid in Sackets Harbor, New York, and also the hometown of Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.The Presidency for Sale \u2014 Trump is openly cashing in on the presidency like never before. His resorts are flooded with billionaires, foreign officials, and MAGA donors, turning the White House into a pay-to-play racket and shredding any line between public service and personal profit.Weaponized Justice \u2014 Trump has turned the DOJ into a blunt political instrument. From firing whistleblowers to threatening law firms and deputizing private allies, the rule of law is under siege.Surveillance State Creep \u2014 Clearview AI, a far-right-linked facial recognition tool, is now central to Trump\u2019s deportation machine. Used by ICE and FBI with no oversight, it enables mass surveillance of immigrants, protesters, and political foes\u2014 just like in Russia and China.Authoritarian Playbook \u2014 From DOJ purges to whistleblower intimidation and visa revocations, Trump is bypassing democratic norms and centralizing unchecked power.Civil Rights in Peril \u2014 Immigrants, journalists, and even U.S. citizens are facing government overreach, detention, and being disappeared under a regime driven by vengeance and ideology.Musk\u2019s Expanding Role \u2014 Musk\u2019s grip on federal IT, law enforcement, and data access is eroding transparency, threatening civil liberties, and destabilizing core government functions.Resistance Is Working \u2014 Public outrage and legal action are slowing down Trump\u2019s worst excesses\u2014from ICE family detentions to overreach on labor and trade. \ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Tactics</span></p><p><span>Distraction And Disillusion Are The Goals</span></p><p><span>Many of us are having sleepless nights, due to the constant nightmarish barrage of horrendous daily news. It feels like all respected traditions and norms of civilized governance are being discarded, along with citizens\u2019 dignity and inalienable rights, with the mere stroke of a Sharpie.</span></p><p><span>It\u2019s like we have fallen down the rabbit hole and the Mad Hatter is dictating policy, with neither thought nor care for the consequences. And Trump\u2019s emotionless surrogate Elon Musk, via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is ransacking programs and peoples\u2019 lives, with robotic disregard.</span></p><p><span>I am overwhelmed with sadness, for the lives that will be lost, the diseases that won\u2019t be prevented and the research for cures that will be stymied, by the freezing of USAID funds. It\u2019s difficult to fathom the abject cruelty behind stranding millions of tons of emergency rations rotting in shipping containers abroad and in U.S. farmers\u2019 warehouses, while children are dying from malnutrition.</span></p><p><span>Trump has also signed an Executive Order (EO), withdrawing The United States from the World Health Organization. This administration has an empathy-free protocol. The appointment of vaccine denier Robert Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of the Department of Health, further serves to emphasize Trump\u2019s lack of concern for the health of the nation.</span></p><p><span>I am appalled by the disrespect and lack of compassion for veterans, who have seen the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) stripped of personnel and resources. The recent budget and staff cuts enacted by DOGE, greatly limit programs devised to provide lifelong resources to vets and their families, including therapy and suicide counselling.</span></p><p><span>I\u2019m disgusted by the blatantly displayed racism behind ending the Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiative. D.E.I. exists to give everyone a fair chance at education and employment, regardless of race, sex or physical limitations. Trump would have us believe its purpose is to steal placements from white men, to put it simply. The extent of his discrimination is so cancerous that attempts have been made to erase the historical records of accomplishments by minorities.</span></p><p><span>I am flabbergasted by the utter stupidity in disregarding the importance of departments like The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAH). Trump\u2019s actions to eliminate clean energy incentives and environmental protection regulations are to accommodate his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d declaration. This short-sighted attitude of greed and climate change denial, has also resulted in withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord.</span></p><p><span>The flood of irresponsible and detrimental policy changes and E.O.s, flowing like toxic sewage from the Oval Office is extensive. The self-serving actions of Musk\u2019s DOGE, are to wreak havoc, and to protect himself from a myriad of pending lawsuits, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Installing corrupt cronies to oversee these government agencies, also facilitates Trump\u2019s crypto scams and stock manipulations, by removing any semblance of oversight.</span></p><p><span>The Supreme Court majority has virtually surrendered its vigilance of constitutionally mandated laws, with last year\u2019s verdict giving Trump immunity, for most of his actions, while in power. Just today SCOTUS allowed the Trump administration to temporarily maintain the suspension of $65 million in teacher training grants, due to DEI concerns raised by the Education Department. Universities across the country are being threatened with defunding, if they don\u2019t comply with Trump\u2019s agenda.</span></p><p><span>All politically unaffiliated department heads of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice have been replaced by inept MAGA toadies, who have sworn allegiance to Trump, over loyalty to their country. Trump wasted no time activating those agencies in a personal witch hunt of retribution and extortion, against anyone involved in trying to bring him to justice, for his multitude of past crimes. Law firms are being blackmailed into refusing representation to anyone challenging his edicts. As an added insult, Trump not only pardoned the entire despicable cast of the January 6th insurrection, he is floating the idea of compensating them.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, students are being illegally deported and imprisoned without due process, for exercising their rights to peacefully protest. Minorities with tattoos are being renditioned to a El Salvador prison, and kept in sub-human conditions, on the judgemental whims of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</span></p><p><span>The recently announced illogical tariffs, which already threaten to tank the economy, are instrumental in achieving the end result of rendering the American public penniless and powerless. Trump reportedly posted on Truth Social Friday, April 4th, that his strategy is \u201cALREADY WORKING\u201d and \u201cMY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,\u201d according to The New York Times.</span></p><p><span>While it may seem that an unhinged demented President is steering the ship with a malfunctioning compass, there is method to the madness. Demoralizing and overwhelming the public into a sense of helplessness, is essential to the unfolding plot line scripted in Project 2025. That 900 plus page guide to presidential transition is based loosely on the beliefs of Curtis Yarvin, that democracy is doomed, and the population should be ruled by a Monarch or C.E.O. It was produced by The Heritage Foundation and other ultra conservative groups, as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s return to office, and suggests the President should have absolute power over all branches of government. Project 2025 is Yarvin on steroids. Trump tried to publicly distance himself from it before the election, but since his inauguration in January, his actions and E.O.s have echoed The Heritage Foundation\u2019s guidance.</span></p><p><span>There can be no doubt, that a coup is underway, and rapidly approaching fruition. The systematic dismantling of checks and balances of power, is pretty much accomplished. Cowardly Republicans and supine Democrat Congressional Representatives\u2019 voices of dissent have been absent, but for a few rarities. The hope for a blue wave of dissent in 2026, to alter the present course of mayhem, will fade into the vapour of fantasy, if they don\u2019t collectively condemn this administration.</span></p><p><span>Today, courageous people will stand up and be heard in massive nationwide demonstrations. I anticipate their cries of outrage will be thunderous. I pray their voices will be heard and heeded, for their cause is righteous. Their success is crucial.</span></p><p><span>Thanks for reading john king! </span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full

Demoralizing and overwhelming the public into a sense of helplessness, is essential to the unfolding plot line scripted in Project 2025. That 900 plus page guide to presidential transition is based loosely on the beliefs of Curtis Yarvin, that democracy is doomed, and the population should be ruled by a Monarch or C.E.O. It was produced by The Heritage Foundation and other ultra conservative groups, as a blueprint for Trump\\u2019s return to office, and suggests the President should have absolute power over all branches of government. Project 2025 is Yarvin on steroids. Trump tried to publicly distance himself from it before the election, but since his inauguration in January, his actions and E.O.s have echoed The Heritage Foundation\\u2019s guidance.\\\\n\\\\nThere can be no doubt, that a coup is underway, and rapidly approaching fruition. The systematic dismantling of checks and balances of power, is pretty much accomplished. Cowardly Republicans and supine Democrat Congressional Representatives\\u2019 voices of dissent have been absent, but for a few rarities. The hope for a blue wave of dissent in 2026, to alter the present course of mayhem, will fade into the vapour of fantasy, if they don\\u2019t collectively condemn this administration.\\\\n\\\\nToday, courageous people will stand up and be heard in massive nationwide demonstrations.

It was produced by The Heritage Foundation and other ultra conservative groups, as a blueprint for Trump\\u2019s return to office, and suggests the President should have absolute power over all branches of government. Project 2025 is Yarvin on steroids. Trump tried to publicly distance himself from it before the election, but since his inauguration in January, his actions and E.O.s have echoed The Heritage Foundation\\u2019s guidance.\\\"}]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"paragraph\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"There can be no doubt, that a coup is underway, and rapidly approaching fruition.
