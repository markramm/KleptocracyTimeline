  "content": "President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet in Helsinki in 2018.Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP fileShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 3Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Faces Backlash Over Plans for a National Crypto ReserveWhat Happened: Trump announced a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, committing the government to stockpile Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The plan has fueled a surge in crypto prices but sparked criticism across the political spectrum, including some conservatives and crypto supporters, over concerns about taxpayer-funded speculation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crypto push follows the industry\u2019s $130 million election support for him and his allies. His regime\u2019s regulatory rollbacks have benefited crypto investors and family members, highlighting that this is not a national strategy but a scheme to enrich insiders.Source: The New York TimesTrump Guts the Corporate Transparency ActWhat Happened: The Treasury Department announced it will not enforce penalties on U.S. businesses that fail to disclose ownership information under the Corporate Transparency Act. Trump celebrated on social media, calling it \u201cexciting news.\u201d The move, spearheaded by Trump and Musk, effectively guts anti-money laundering efforts and shields anonymous shell companies.Why It Matters: This rollback ends efforts to combat illicit finance, allowing oligarchs, criminals, and corrupt actors to hide assets in the U.S. Unchecked shell companies will further erode financial transparency and national security.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s Crypto Reserve Plan Sparks Ethical and Legal ConcernsWhat Happened: Trump is pushing forward with plans to create a \u201ccrypto strategic reserve,\u201d directing federal agencies to stockpile digital assets akin to gold and oil reserves. The proposal includes highly volatile tokens beyond Bitcoin, raising concerns about conflicts of interest, especially given Trump's crypto ventures. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deep ties to the crypto sector blur ethical lines, with taxpayer dollars used to inflate markets and enrich insiders. This move underscores how Trump is reshaping financial policy to favor a specific industry while sidelining regulatory oversight.Source: NBC NewsMusk Charges Federal Agency Millions for \u2018Efficiency\u2019 WorkWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE demands $4 million from the Office of Personnel Management to fund 20 full-time positions tasked with IT modernization. The draft agreement requires OPM to pay upfront and grant Musk access to sensitive government data.Why It Matters: Musk, already criticized for gutting agencies, purging federal workers, and accessing sensitive data, is now forcing agencies to fund its operations, raising questions about transparency, executive overreach, and Musk\u2019s unchecked power in the Trump regime.Source: CNNFDIC to Roll Back Biden-Era Bank Merger RulesWhat Happened: The FDIC plans to weaken regulations that increased scrutiny on large bank mergers, reversing policies enacted under the Biden administration.Why It Matters: Loosening merger rules will accelerate industry consolidation, reducing competition and increasing risks to financial stability\u2014a move that will benefit big banks at the expense of consumers and small lenders.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsUS health agency now says employees must respond to DOGE emailWhat Happened: Trump and Elon Musk are mandating weekly work reports from HHS employees, including the FDA and CDC. Initially optional, compliance is now required. Internal warnings previously cautioned that Musk\u2019s requests could be exploited by foreign actors.Why It Matters: This is a political loyalty test, forcing health officials to justify their work while exposing them to oversight that could compromise public health security and regulatory independence.Source: ReutersWWE Exec Linda McMahon Confirmed to Oversee the Dismantling of the Education DepartmentWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed former WWE executive Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education despite her lack of experience in education policy. Trump has openly called the department a \u201cbig con job\u201d and aims to dismantle it.Why It Matters: McMahon\u2019s appointment is part of Trump\u2019s effort to privatize public education. With $1.5 trillion in federal student loans and critical civil rights protections at stake, her confirmation signals a direct attack on public education, student protections, and Title IX enforcement.Source: Mother JonesHHS Offers Early Retirement Amid Musk-Led CutsWhat Happened: The Health Department offers early retirement as part of Musk\u2019s purge of federal workers. Employees must apply within 10 days while also being forced to report weekly accomplishments, despite prior assurances that responses were optional.Why It Matters: The mass layoffs weaken oversight, threaten essential health services, and risk a mass exodus of experts\u2014leaving the U.S. vulnerable to disease outbreaks, food safety failures, and drug shortages.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump\u2019s U.S. Attorney for D.C. Demotes Prosecutors, Pushes MAGA AgendaWhat Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin\u2014a Trump loyalist and former defense attorney for Jan. 6 insurrectionists and rioters\u2014has demoted senior prosecutors who led Capitol riot cases, reassigned them to misdemeanors, and is rushing to close remaining insurrection prosecutions. Martin also called U.S. attorneys \u201cTrump\u2019s lawyers.\u201dWhy It Matters: Martin is turning the Justice Department into a political tool, undermining prosecutions of insurrectionists while prioritizing Trump\u2019s crackdown on crime in D.C.\u2014a Democratic stronghold. His actions signal the DOJ\u2019s transformation into an arm of Trump\u2019s authoritarian agenda.Source: CBS NewsTrump Freezes Consumer Watchdog, Blocking Millions in PayoutsWhat Happened: Trump has effectively shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, stalling $100 million in restitution for student loan borrowers harmed by Navient and hundreds of millions more from settlements with companies like Cash App, TD Bank, and Honda. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move defangs the CFPB, blocking financial relief for consumers while protecting corporations from accountability. This is part of a broader effort to gut regulatory agencies and eliminate checks on financial misconduct.Source: ReutersFBI New York Chief Forced Out Amid Trump PurgeWhat Happened: James Dennehy, head of the FBI\u2019s New York office, was forced to retire after resisting DOJ efforts to scrutinize agents involved in Jan. 6 cases. His removal follows Trump loyalists Kash Patel and Dan Bongino taking over FBI leadership.Why It Matters: Trump is politicizing federal law enforcement, purging officials loyal to the Constitution and who will not serve his extremist agenda, and targeting those who investigated the Capitol riot\u2014a clear sign of mass firings and political vengeance to come.Source: Associated PressTrump DOJ Intervenes in Pro-Trump Clerk\u2019s Election Tampering ConvictionWhat Happened: The Justice Department is reviewing the conviction of Tina Peters, a former Colorado clerk sentenced to nine years for tampering with voting machines to support Trump\u2019s 2020 election fraud claims. DOJ\u2019s acting assistant AG questioned the sentence and bail denial, citing concerns over \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in the prosecution.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to rewrite history and weaponize the DOJ to protect allies while targeting opponents. The move undermines the rule of law and highlights a shift toward politically motivated legal interventions.Source: New York TimesMusk\u2019s $1 Spending Limit Cripples Federal AgenciesWhat Happened:  Elon Musk imposed a $1 spending limit on federal employee credit cards, halting critical purchases across agencies. NOAA, FDA, NIH, NPS, FAA, and USDA report major disruptions, from radar repairs and drug research to maintenance projects and food safety inspections.Why It Matters: The freeze is paralyzing government operations, delaying vital work, jeopardizing public health and safety, and pushing federal agencies toward dysfunction.Source: WIREDNew FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino Previously Called for Imprisoning DemocratsWhat Happened: Trump named Dan Bongino, a Trump loyalist media figure and former Secret Service agent, as FBI Deputy Director, breaking the tradition of appointing career officials. Bongino has called for eliminating the FBI, mass firings, and imprisoning Obama and Biden while promoting January 6th and election conspiracies.Why It Matters: Kash Patel and Bongino\u2019s appointment will turn the FBI into an enforcement arm of the Trump regime. Bongino\u2019s history of calling for mass firings, loyalty screenings, and partisan prosecutions reiterates that the FBI\u2014like the FSB in Russia\u2014will be used to target Trump\u2019s opponents while shielding his allies.Source: NPRSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump May Exclude Government Spending from GDP, Obscuring Economic Impact of DOGE CutsWhat Happened: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Trump is considering separating government spending from GDP calculations. Why It Matters: By altering economic metrics, Trump can obscure the negative impact of government gutting and layoffs on the economy. Removing government spending from GDP would artificially deflate economic downturn signals, making it easier for Trump and Musk to justify further cuts while lying to Americans about the true state of the economy. This is a classic tactic used by authoritarian regimes to manipulate economic data and control public perception.Source: Associated PressSenior USAID Official Ousted After Exposing Trump\u2019s Aid FailuresWhat Happened: Nicholas Enrich, USAID\u2019s acting global health chief, was placed on leave after exposing Trump\u2019s failure to deliver lifesaving aid due to political interference. His memo contradicted Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s claims of a functioning aid system. The regime has gutted USAID, terminating 90% of programs and cutting over 1,600 jobs.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling USAID and silencing officials who expose failures, ensuring no oversight or accountability. Blocking aid threatens global stability and U.S. influence while causing preventable deaths.Source: The Washington PostTrump Reviews Columbia University\u2019s Federal FundingWhat Happened: Trump is reviewing $5 billion in federal grants and contracts with Columbia University over claims it failed to address antisemitism on campus. Agencies may halt $51 million in contracts, citing Trump\u2019s January executive order targeting universities over antisemitism.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal funding to pressure universities seen as politically opposed, escalating efforts to control higher education and suppress dissent.Source: PoliticoTrump Dismisses Town Hall Protests as \u2018Paid Troublemakers\u2019What Happened: Trump claimed that recent protests at Republican town halls were staged by paid agitators. His remarks followed heated backlash at events where voters criticized Elon Musk for his drastic cuts across federal agencies.Why It Matters: Labeling protesters as \u201cpaid agitators\u201d mirrors a Kremlin disinformation tactic used to delegitimize dissent and silence opposition. By dismissing public outrage as orchestrated, Trump is undermining democratic accountability.Source: PoliticoGOP Bill Proposes Putting Trump\u2019s Face on $100 BillWhat Happened: Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) introduced the Golden Age Act of 2025, proposing that all $100 bills feature Trump\u2019s face starting in 2028. Co-sponsored by Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), the bill aligns with Trump\u2019s claim that his presidency marks the \u201cGolden Age of America.\u201dWhy It Matters: The move to elevate Trump\u2019s image on U.S. currency reflects authoritarian-style leader worship, often seen in regimes that prioritize personal loyalty over policy. This follows GOP efforts to rewrite Trump\u2019s legacy, further embedding cult-like devotion into government policy.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsInternal Memos Reveal USAID Leaders Warned of Mass Deaths Before Trump\u2019s CutsWhat Happened: Senior USAID officials warned Trump appointees that gutting foreign aid would cause 1 million children to go untreated for malnutrition, 166,000 malaria deaths, a 30% rise in TB cases, and 200,000 polio-related disabilities over the next decade. Despite this, Trump and Musk dismantled USAID, blocking waivers and obstructing staff.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling life-saving global health programs, ignoring expert warnings, and silencing officials like Nick Enrich, who exposed the crisis before being placed on leave.Source: ProPublicaCivil Rights Pioneers Warn of \u2018Surge Backwards\u2019 Under TrumpWhat Happened: Civil rights activists who fought against segregation warn that Trump\u2019s policies are undoing decades of racial progress. Trump has eliminated federal DEI programs, prompting major corporations like Target, Walmart, and Meta to follow suit. Even the NFL dropped its \"End Racism\" slogan under pressure.Why It Matters: Activists see Trump\u2019s second term as a return to segregationist-era tactics, likening it to past backlashes against racial progress. The rollback of DEI policies signals a systemic effort to erase protections for marginalized communities.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial Watch and Geopolitical WatchTrudeau Meets with King Charles Amid Trump\u2019s Threat to Annex CanadaWhat Happened: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with King Charles III to discuss concerns over Trump\u2019s threats to annex Canada. While officials did not disclose details of their conversation, Trudeau emphasized that protecting Canada\u2019s sovereignty is a top priority.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s escalating rhetoric threatens to destabilize U.S.-Canada relations and undermine Canada\u2019s independence. Trump shows fealty to Russia while threatening America\u2019s closest allies.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDOGE Moves to Shut Down Nuclear Waste Office in New MexicoWhat Happened: Elon Musk is attempting to close the Department of Energy\u2019s Carlsbad office, which manages the only deep geologic nuclear waste repository in the world. The office oversees the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and includes an emergency response center for handling nuclear accidents. The closure would impact at least 200 employees and compromise nuclear safety operations.Why It Matters: The shutdown of a critical nuclear waste management facility endangers public safety and undermines national security. While Trump and Republicans push for more nuclear energy, they are gutting the infrastructure needed to safely manage nuclear waste, risking catastrophic failures and long-term environmental hazards.Source: NOTUSMusk\u2019s Meddling in Social Security Could Lead to \u2018System Collapse\u2019What Happened: Former Social Security Commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley warned that Trump and Musk\u2019s deep cuts and mass firings at the SSA could cause a total system collapse and benefit interruptions within 90 days. The regime has already shuttered offices, eliminated key oversight departments, and is slashing 7,000 jobs.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate attack on Social Security to justify its privatization and dismantling. Musk has spread lies about fraud to justify gutting SSA oversight, while Trump prioritizes tax breaks for billionaires over the retirement security of millions of Americans.Source: Rolling Stone\u2018It\u2019s Just Mind-Blowing\u2019: DOGE Laid Off Workers Who Were Protecting Infrastructure From Foreign HackersWhat Happened: Musk laid off over 100 cybersecurity experts at CISA, the federal agency responsible for protecting U.S. infrastructure from cyberattacks. The cuts included agents tracking Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, which had infiltrated U.S. telecom networks. The layoffs occurred without clear criteria, eliminating critical expertise and institutional knowledge.Why It Matters: These layoffs cripple America\u2019s cyber defenses, leaving America more vulnerable to foreign cyberattacks. By gutting CISA, Trump is dismantling national security infrastructure, ignoring threats from China, Russia, and other adversaries, and creating long-term vulnerabilities that would take years to fix.Source: NOTUSTrump\u2019s FDA Cuts Are Putting Drug Development at RiskWhat Happened: Budget and staffing cuts at the Food and Drug Administration under Trump and Musk have led to widespread concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. SEC filings from multiple companies warn that FDA slowdowns could delay drug research, approvals, and commercialization.Why It Matters: The gutting of the FDA is crippling regulatory oversight and will delay life-saving medications while benefiting corporate interests that seek to weaken safety regulations. Pharmaceutical companies are warning that new drug development could grind to a halt, affecting millions of Americans who rely on FDA-approved treatments.Source: WIREDUSAID Cuts Cripple Congo Disease ResponseWhat Happened: A deadly mystery illness with Ebola-like symptoms has killed 60+ people and infected 1,000+ in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Trump and Musk\u2019s USAID cuts have gutted disease response teams, delaying containment efforts.Why It Matters: By dismantling USAID, Trump has crippled global disease response, risking pandemic spread and endangering public health worldwide\u2014including the U.S.Source: WIREDTop HHS Spokesman Resigns Abruptly After Two WeeksWhat Happened: Tom Corry, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned suddenly just weeks after being sworn in under Trump\u2019s second term. Corry, who previously served during Trump\u2019s first term, announced his departure on LinkedIn without explanation.Why It Matters: His abrupt exit suggests internal turmoil within HHS as Trump and RFK Jr. overhaul public health policies. The regime\u2019s rapid politicization of agencies and extremist agenda is driving out officials unwilling to conform.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Suspends Military Aid to Ukraine After Oval Office AmbushWhat Happened: Following a hostile Oval Office meeting, where Trump and Vance ambushed President Zelenskyy, Trump suspended over $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine, demanding Kyiv show a \u201cgood-faith commitment\u201d to peace talks with Russia. This helps Russia\u2019s genocidal war, weakens Ukraine\u2019s defenses, and isolates the U.S. from NATO allies.Why It Matters: The ambush on Zelenskyy was most likely orchestrated as a pretext to abandon Ukraine and end all support. Trump continues to assist Russia while risking Ukrainian battlefield losses and threatening European security.Source: New York TimesTrump Prepares Russia Sanctions Relief PlanWhat Happened: The White House has directed the State and Treasury Departments to draft options for easing sanctions on Russian entities and oligarchs, delivering another victory to Russia. Why It Matters: Trump is attempting to strengthen Putin's regime and improve Russia\u2019s economy while betraying our European allies. Source: ReutersPutin Ally Lobbying Trump Team to Restart Nord Stream 2What Happened: Matthias Warnig\u2014a longtime Putin ally, intelligence recruit from Putin\u2019s Dresden KGB days, and former head of Nord Stream 2\u2014 is lobbying Trump\u2019s team to restart the Russian gas pipeline. Warnig is reportedly using American businessmen as intermediaries, pushing for the U.S. to lift sanctions and for Germany to approve renewed gas flows.Why It Matters: A revived Nord Stream 2 would solidify Russia\u2019s economic leverage over Europe while deepening Trump\u2019s alignment with Putin. It directly undermines EU sanctions on Russia and weakens transatlantic unity.Source: Financial TimesTrump Suggests Zelenskyy \u2018Won\u2019t Be Around Very Long\u2019 If He Refuses a Deal With RussiaWhat Happened: Trump stated that a Russia- Ukraine deal \u201ccould be made very fast\u201d and warned that if Zelenskyy doesn\u2019t agree, \u201cthat person won\u2019t be around very long.\u201d U.S. calls for Zelenskyy to resign have unified Ukrainians, who are infuriated that Russia\u2019s proxy is making such demands.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s remarks echo Kremlin threats against Zelenskyy, aligning with Putin\u2019s strategy of intimidation. This comes as Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a \u201cdeal\u201d to surrender to Russia. Trump is working very hard to deliver Kyiv\u2019s capitulation to Moscow.Source: Associated PressTrump\u2019s Embrace of Russia Shakes NATOWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s dismissal of Ukraine\u2019s security concerns and alignment with Russia have strained NATO. He questioned U.S. commitments to Article 5, while Elon Musk backed calls to exit NATO and the UN. European leaders met in London to discuss defense independence, with the UK and France pushing a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to support Ukraine.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s attacks on NATO weaken Western security, embolden Russia, and threaten Europe\u2019s stability. His America (or Russia) First rhetoric and policy shifts are fracturing the alliance, creating power vacuums that Moscow will exploit, and forcing Europe to seek security solutions independent of the U.S.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Halts Offensive Cyber Operations Against RussiaWhat Happened: Trump suspended all offensive cyber operations against Russia, halting both active missions and planning efforts by U.S. Cyber Command. The decision comes as Trump seeks d\u00e9tente with Moscow, despite Russia\u2019s increased cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, election interference, and cybercrime operations.Why It Matters: This endangers U.S. national security by allowing Russian hackers and intelligence operatives to operate unchecked. It undermines U.S. deterrence, emboldens Moscow, and signals Trump\u2019s continued fealty to Putin at the expense of American and allied cybersecurity.Source: CNNTrump Aligns with Russia, Abandoning Decades of U.S. Foreign PolicyWhat Happened: Trump has dramatically shifted U.S. foreign policy in favor of Russia, undermining support for Ukraine and dismantling Biden-era counter-Kremlin measures. His regime has paused military aid to Ukraine, halted U.S. cyber operations against Russia, disbanded programs targeting Russian oligarchs, and excluded Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks.Why It Matters: This betrayal threatens to end NATO, weaken European security, and embolden Vladimir Putin. By abandoning Ukraine and aligning with Russia, Trump is steering the U.S. toward authoritarian interests.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn News Trump\u2019s 25% Tariffs on Canada, Mexico Take Effect; Canada and China RetaliateWhat Happened: The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, excluding energy products, which face a 10% tariff. A new 10% tariff on Chinese imports also took effect. In response, Canada announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on $100 billion of U.S. goods, and China imposed 15% tariffs on U.S. chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, plus 10% tariffs on soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, and dairy.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s escalating trade war triggers retaliatory measures from key allies and economic rivals. These tariffs will significantly increase costs for businesses and Americans, inflame global tensions, and destabilize markets\u2014creating global economic instability.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s Auto Tariffs to Spike Car Prices by $12,000What Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico could raise U.S. car prices by as much as $12,000, with crossover utility vehicle costs rising at least $4,000. The move disrupts North American auto supply chains, increasing costs for manufacturers and consumers.Why It Matters: The tariffs serve Trump\u2019s nationalist agenda while punishing key U.S. trading partners. By artificially inflating costs, his regime is manipulating economic forces to consolidate control, benefiting select industries while burdening American consumers.Source: BloombergWarren Buffett calls Trump\u2019s tariffs a tax on goods, says \u2018the tooth fairy doesn\u2019t pay \u2018em\u2019What Happened: Warren Buffett warned that Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China would act as a tax on consumers, driving inflation and economic instability. Dismissing claims that tariffs are cost-free, Buffett quipped, \u201cThe tooth fairy doesn\u2019t pay \u2018em!\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs will drive up prices, disrupt global trade, and weaponize the economy for political gain.

Families are struggling\u2014some are applying for food stamps for the first time, pulling kids from child care, or selling their homes.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s purge is devastating communities and isn\u2019t about shrinking government; it is a targeted assault on institutions that fund public health, education, and research. By crippling economic hubs like the Research Triangle, his regime is dismantling expertise and hollowing out entire industries under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201dSource: CNNU.S. Construction Spending Falls Amid Trump\u2019s Tariff ThreatsWhat Happened: Construction spending dropped 0.2% in January, driven by declines in multi-family homebuilding. Higher mortgage rates and weak demand persist, with further disruptions expected as Trump's new tariffs on lumber, appliances, and other imports take effect.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs will inflate construction costs, worsen housing affordability, and disrupt supply chains.Source: ReutersMAGA media admitted that Trump\u2019s agenda could cause economic mayhem.

report yet. Of course there is the usual foxes guarding the henhouse measures and appointments as well as the criminals disarming the police tactics. All occurring to the relentless drumbeat to privatize everything from schools to currency, from social security to public lands.</span></p><p><span> What I find alarming besides all this cultic, slavish idolatry of Trump by sycophants and toadies is the dismantling of American national security. The closing of surveillance, the shutdown of defenses.</span></p><p><span>  They are actively striving to weaken our defenses and there is no financial gain for them in doing that, so what are their motives?</span></p><p><span> Corruption and venality I can understand and this administration is the certainly the most corrupt in our history, but opening America to takeover by hostile overseas actors?  This is treason of the highest order and urgent cause for Trump's immediate impeachment.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 3</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his

Backlash Over Plans for a National Crypto Reserve</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, committing the government to stockpile Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The plan has fueled a surge in crypto prices but sparked criticism across the political spectrum, including some conservatives and crypto supporters, over concerns about taxpayer-funded speculation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s crypto push follows the industry\\u2019s $130 million election support for him and his allies. His regime\\u2019s regulatory rollbacks have benefited crypto investors and family members, highlighting that this is not a national strategy but a scheme to enrich insiders.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/business/dealbook/trump-crypto-bitcoin-reserve.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Guts the Corporate Transparency Act</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Treasury Department announced it will not enforce penalties on U.S. businesses that fail to disclose ownership information under the Corporate Transparency Act. Trump celebrated on social media, calling it \\u201Cexciting news.\\u201D The move, spearheaded by Trump and Musk, effectively guts anti-money laundering efforts and shields anonymous shell companies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This rollback ends efforts to combat illicit finance, allowing oligarchs, criminals, and corrupt actors to hide assets in the U.S. Unchecked shell companies will further erode financial transparency and national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-curbs-enforcement-of-the-corporate-transparency-act-4ea50e81\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Crypto Reserve Plan Sparks Ethical and Legal Concerns</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is pushing forward with plans to create a \\u201Ccrypto strategic reserve,\\u201D directing federal agencies to stockpile digital assets akin to gold and oil reserves. The proposal includes highly volatile tokens beyond Bitcoin, raising concerns about conflicts of interest, especially given Trump's crypto ventures. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s deep ties to the crypto sector blur ethical lines, with taxpayer dollars used to inflate markets and enrich insiders. This move underscores how Trump is reshaping financial policy to favor a specific industry while sidelining regulatory oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/trump-proposal-create-crypto-strategic-reserve-vexes-industry-supporte-rcna194478\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Charges Federal Agency Millions for \\u2018Efficiency\\u2019 Work</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Elon Musk\\u2019s unauthorized DOGE demands $4 million from the Office of Personnel Management to fund 20 full-time positions tasked with IT modernization. The draft agreement requires OPM to pay upfront and grant Musk access to sensitive government data.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk, already criticized for gutting agencies, purging federal workers, and accessing sensitive data, is now forcing agencies to fund its operations, raising questions about transparency, executive overreach, and Musk\\u2019s unchecked power in the Trump regime.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/doge-wants-to-charge-opm-millions/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>FDIC to Roll Back Biden-Era Bank Merger Rules</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FDIC plans to weaken regulations that increased scrutiny on large bank mergers, reversing policies enacted under the Biden administration.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Loosening merger rules will accelerate industry consolidation, reducing competition and increasing risks to financial stability\\u2014a move that will benefit big banks at the expense of consumers and small lenders.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-03-03-2025/card/fdic-to-seek-rollback-of-bank-merger-rule-9lqpnL0HqiLuAYCpgWPl\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>US health agency now says employees must respond to DOGE email</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump and Elon Musk are mandating weekly work reports from HHS employees, including the FDA and CDC. Initially optional, compliance is now required. Internal warnings previously cautioned that Musk\\u2019s requests could be exploited by foreign actors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a political loyalty test, forcing health officials to justify their work while exposing them to oversight that could compromise public health security and regulatory independence.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-health-agency-now-says-employees-must-respond-doge-email-2025-03-03/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>WWE Exec Linda McMahon Confirmed to Oversee the Dismantling of the Education Department</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Senate confirmed former WWE executive Linda McMahon as Secretary of Education despite her lack of experience in education policy. Trump has openly called the department a \\u201Cbig con job\\u201D and aims to dismantle it.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> McMahon\\u2019s appointment is part of Trump\\u2019s effort to privatize public education. With $1.5 trillion in federal student loans and critical civil rights protections at stake, her confirmation signals a direct attack on public education, student protections, and Title IX enforcement.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/linda-mcmahon-confirmed-poised-oversee-end-trumps-education-department/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>HHS Offers Early Retirement Amid Musk-Led Cuts</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Health Department offers early retirement as part of Musk\\u2019s purge of federal workers.

DOJ\\u2019s acting assistant AG questioned the sentence and bail denial, citing concerns over \\u201Cpolitical bias\\u201D in the prosecution.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of Trump\\u2019s broader effort to rewrite history and weaponize the DOJ to protect allies while targeting opponents.

Bongino has called for eliminating the FBI, mass firings, and imprisoning Obama and Biden while promoting January 6th and election conspiracies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Kash Patel and Bongino\\u2019s appointment will turn the FBI into an enforcement arm of the Trump regime. Bongino\\u2019s history of calling for mass firings, loyalty screenings, and partisan prosecutions reiterates that the FBI\\u2014like the FSB in Russia\\u2014will be used to target Trump\\u2019s opponents while shielding his allies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5308020/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-director-conspiracies-podcast\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump May Exclude Government Spending from GDP, Obscuring Economic Impact of DOGE Cuts</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Trump is considering separating government spending from GDP calculations. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By altering economic metrics, Trump can obscure the negative impact of government gutting and layoffs on the economy. Removing government spending from GDP would artificially deflate economic downturn signals, making it easier for Trump and Musk to justify further cuts while lying to Americans about the true state of the economy. This is a classic tactic used by authoritarian regimes to manipulate economic data and control public perception.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-doge-housing-crisis-cuts-discrimination-d0c6e3b4b030787a1f60a7dc153153dd\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Senior USAID Official Ousted After Exposing Trump\\u2019s Aid Failures</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Nicholas Enrich, USAID\\u2019s acting global health chief, was placed on leave after exposing Trump\\u2019s failure to deliver lifesaving aid due to political interference. His memo contradicted Secretary of State Marco Rubio\\u2019s claims of a functioning aid system. The regime has gutted USAID, terminating 90% of programs and cutting over 1,600 jobs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is dismantling USAID and silencing officials who expose failures, ensuring no oversight or accountability.

Agencies may halt $51 million in contracts, citing Trump\\u2019s January executive order targeting universities over antisemitism.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using federal funding to pressure universities seen as politically opposed, escalating efforts to control higher education and suppress dissent.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/03/columbia-university-trump-administration-review-federal-contracts-00209900\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Dismisses Town Hall Protests as \\u2018Paid Troublemakers\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump claimed that recent protests at Republican town halls were staged by paid agitators. His remarks followed heated backlash at events where voters criticized Elon Musk for his drastic cuts across federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Labeling protesters as \\u201Cpaid agitators\\u201D mirrors a Kremlin disinformation tactic used to delegitimize dissent and silence opposition.

Troy Nehls (R-TX), the bill aligns with Trump\\u2019s claim that his presidency marks the \\u201CGolden Age of America.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move to elevate Trump\\u2019s image on U.S. currency reflects authoritarian-style leader worship, often seen in regimes that prioritize personal loyalty over policy.

Trump has eliminated federal DEI programs, prompting major corporations like Target, Walmart, and Meta to follow suit. Even the NFL dropped its \\\\\\\"End Racism\\\\\\\" slogan under pressure.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Activists see Trump\\u2019s second term as a return to segregationist-era tactics, likening it to past backlashes against racial progress.

The closure would impact at least 200 employees and compromise nuclear safety operations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The shutdown of a critical nuclear waste management facility endangers public safety and undermines national security.

The cuts included agents tracking Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, which had infiltrated U.S. telecom networks. The layoffs occurred without clear criteria, eliminating critical expertise and institutional knowledge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These layoffs cripple America\\u2019s cyber defenses, leaving America more vulnerable to foreign cyberattacks.
