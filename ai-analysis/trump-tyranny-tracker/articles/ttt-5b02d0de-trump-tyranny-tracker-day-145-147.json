Some were paid by organizations tied to pardoned allies, fake electors, and Trump\u2019s legal defense operations.Why It Matters: The disclosures highlight how Trump\u2019s orbit has become a money-making machine, where loyalty is rewarded with cash and influence\u2014like in Russia. The blurred lines between grift and governance reveal that Trump\u2019s second term is run by loyalists cashing in on power.  Source: New York TimesClose Trump Allies Sponsored the Military Parade, Raising Ethical ConcernsWhat Happened: The Army\u2019s 250th anniversary parade in Washington was sponsored by companies closely tied to Trump\u2014UFC\u2019s Dana White, Palantir, Coinbase, and Oracle. Several have received federal contracts or favors, using the national event to boost their brands.Why It Matters: This merges state power with private gain, violating federal rules and turning patriotic events and Trump spectacles into showcases for Trump-aligned corporations. Source: New York TimesICE directed to pause immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, sources tell CBS NewsWhat Happened: Trump has quietly paused ICE raids at farms, hotels, and restaurants after industry leaders warned the crackdown was gutting their workforce. The move follows soaring arrest rates and signals a reversal driven by economic fallout.Why It Matters: The shift exposes Trump\u2019s double standard\u2014aggressively targeting immigrant communities while protecting business allies. It highlights how political loyalty and profit override consistency, justice, and due process.Source: CBS News and New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Immigration P.R. Campaign Enters a New Militarized PhaseWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime is using a propaganda blitz to promote its immigration crackdown, flooding social media with militarized videos of raids and arrests. Many clips come from far-right influencers and depict soldiers in U.S. streets to glorify mass deportations and deter protests.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian spectacle designed to normalize fear and condition Americans to accept military presence in civilian life. It dehumanizes immigrants and lays the groundwork for violent repression against Americans disguised as law enforcement.Source: New York TimesTrump Says He Decides What \u2018America First\u2019 MeansWhat Happened: In an interview with The Atlantic, Trump declared that \u201cAmerica First\u201d means whatever he says it means, dismissing critics like Tucker Carlson who oppose U.S. backing of Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran. He defended his foreign policy record and claimed \u201csuccess\u201d in global conflicts\u2014moments before abruptly ending the call to speak with Putin.Why It Matters: Trump is making U.S. policy\u2014at home and abroad\u2014about himself. His dismissal of MAGA allies shows this isn\u2019t about ideology, but about power. The message is clear: obey Trump, or be cast aside.Source: The Atlantic\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsThe Marines Are in Los AngelesWhat Happened: Around 200 active-duty Marines were deployed to Los Angeles during protests against Trump\u2019s immigration raids. Armed and trained for riot control, the Marines can detain civilians if they feel \u201cthreatened,\u201d despite lacking clear legal authority. The deployment, carried out without invoking the Insurrection Act, has sparked backlash from state officials and constitutional scholars.Why It Matters: This is the most aggressive domestic military deployment in decades and dangerously erodes the line between military and police. This mirrors authoritarian tactics, undermines constitutional norms, and sets the stage for violent clashes between American troops and civilians.Source: Military.comRepublicans Launch Investigation Into Newsom and Bass Over LA ProtestsWhat Happened: House Republicans have opened a probe into California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, accusing them of \u201cobstructing\u201d federal efforts to control recent protests. Oversight Chair James Comer claims they \u201cdefended violent rioters\u201d and undermined Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard.Why It Matters: This is another Trump-led assault on Democratic leaders and sanctuary cities\u2014using Congress, the DOJ, and other agencies to punish political enemies, criminalize protest, and send a warning to other blue states that they need to obey or will be targeted.Source: NewsweekWhite House Reviews SpaceX ContractsWhat Happened: Trump ordered the Pentagon and NASA to review SpaceX\u2019s $22 billion in contracts after Musk publicly criticized him. Why It Matters: Trump continues using the federal government to target critics. It threatens stable governance and weaponizes government partnerships for personal payback.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News\u2018No Kings\u2019 Protests, Citizen-Run ICE Trackers Trigger Intelligence WarningsWhat Happened: Army and fusion center analysts are tracking civilians who use digital tools to monitor ICE raids, labeling crowd-sourced protest maps a \u201cstrategic threat.\u201d Internal bulletins, obtained by WIRED, admit most users are nonviolent\u2014but still treat them as surveillance targets amid growing unrest.Why It Matters: Civilians using transparency tools are now framed as threats, while the government deploys military surveillance on U.S. soil. This mirrors authoritarian regimes where public dissent is criminalized and met with state repression.Source: WIREDHow a Pentagon account on X became Pete Hegseth\u2019s personal cheerleaderWhat Happened: The Pentagon\u2019s \u201crapid response team\u201d has morphed into a hyper-partisan X account that attacks journalists, mocks opponents, and promotes Hegseth with Christian nationalist and authoritarian rhetoric\u2014cheering troop deployments and smearing critics as \u201cfake news.\u201dWhy It Matters: Turning an official military communications arm into a political weapon collapses longstanding civil-military boundaries. It mirrors tactics used in authoritarian states, where agencies are hijacked to spread propaganda and enforce loyalty.Source: The GuardianDirector of National Portrait Gallery Resigns After Trump\u2019s Attempted FiringWhat Happened: Kim Sajet, longtime director of the National Portrait Gallery, resigned just weeks after Trump tried to fire her for supporting DEI and rejecting a pro-Trump painting. The Smithsonian Institution initially rebuffed Trump\u2019s move, defending its independence, but Sajet ultimately stepped down to protect the museum.Why It Matters: Sajet\u2019s ousting shows how Trump\u2019s loyalty tests and ideological purges continue reaching into cultural institutions. The move threatens the independence of America\u2019s most respected public arts organizations.Source: The GuardianAustralian Deported From US Says He Was Targeted for Writing on Pro-Palestine ProtestsWhat Happened: Alistair Kitchen, an Australian writer and former Columbia student, was detained at LAX, questioned about his political views, and deported over blog posts supporting Gaza protests. U.S. officials linked his ESTA application to his online activity, raising concerns of surveillance.Why It Matters: Kitchen\u2019s deportation shows how Trump\u2019s border policies are being used to target dissent, even among foreign visitors. Surveillance and ideological vetting are being weaponized to punish political speech and chill academic freedom.Source: The GuardianDemocratic Minnesota Politician Killed in \u2018Politically Motivated Assassination\u2019What Happened: Vance Boelter assassinated Democratic State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and separately opened fire on Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Posing as law enforcement, Boelter left behind a hit list of pro-choice lawmakers. Authorities say the attacks were politically motivated.Why It Matters: This is a targeted political assassination\u2014part of a dangerous escalation in lone-wolf violence fueled by radicalized ideologies. Trump and MAGA Republicans are worsening the crisis through rhetoric that normalizes violence and demonizes political opponents. The U.S. is veering down a perilous path where democratic participation becomes life-threatening.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsPregnant U.S. Citizen Says DHS Secretary Kristi Noem Led ICE Raid on Her HomeWhat Happened: Sabrina Medina, a pregnant U.S. citizen, says ICE agents stormed her Huntington Park home looking for her undocumented husband\u2014with Kristi Noem herself leading the raid. Surveillance footage shows Noem outside as agents entered. Medina, pulled from the shower, said: \u201cI feel like a criminal now.\u201dWhy It Matters: Noem\u2019s continued participation in immigration raids\u2014with cameras in tow\u2014highlights the use of immigration enforcement as a political spectacle. This weaponizes fear, humiliates citizens, and erodes due process in favor of propaganda and optics.Source: NBC Los AngelesICE Arrests Louisiana Mother of 9-Week-Old, Wife of Marine at Immigration HearingWhat Happened: ICE agents arrested Paola Clouatre, a Baton Rouge mother of two and wife of a U.S. Marine veteran, during a routine immigration check-in in New Orleans. Despite breastfeeding her 9-week-old daughter, she remains detained in a Louisiana facility as her family awaits a judge\u2019s ruling on her deportation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has veered into a new direction, targeting women and families at court dates and ICE check-ins\u2014places once considered safe to encourage legal compliance. Arresting a Marine\u2019s wife sends a chilling message that under this regime, even nursing mothers married to U.S. veterans are fair game.Source: Military.comMarines detain civilian in Los Angeles, in first such caseWhat Happened: U.S. Marines in Los Angeles detained a civilian, veteran Marcos Leao, after he crossed caution tape near a federal building on his way to a VA appointment. He was zip-tied and held for over two hours with no charges. This appears to be the first time active-duty Marines have detained a U.S. citizen on American soil.Why It Matters: This unprecedented detention by active-duty Marines signals a dangerous erosion of the Posse Comitatus Act and a step toward military policing of civilians. It\u2019s a warning sign of a growing police state\u2014where the lines between armed forces and law enforcement are vanishing.Source: Task and PurposeVideo Shows ICE Detaining Afghan Interpreter Who Aided U.S. TroopsWhat Happened: A viral video showed ICE agents detaining an Afghan man inside a San Diego courthouse as he calmly stated he served as a U.S. military interpreter. His lawyer says he entered legally via the CBP One app and is seeking a Special Immigrant Visa. Despite his service, he now faces expedited deportation.Why It Matters: This betrayal of a wartime ally\u2014who now faces jail or execution in Afghanistan for helping the U.S.\u2014sends a chilling message to future interpreters and informants. It erodes trust, endangers lives, and shatters America\u2019s moral and strategic credibility.Source: NBC San DiegoPadilla warns about what happens \"when cameras are not there\" after removal from Noem eventWhat Happened: Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS news conference in Los Angeles after questioning Kristi Noem about immigration raids. He warned that if a senator can be silenced like this, the public should fear what happens \u201cwhen the cameras are not there.\u201dWhy It Matters: The removal of a sitting senator underscores Trump\u2019s escalating hostility toward opposition, oversight, and transparency. Padilla's warning raises alarms about unchecked abuses happening behind closed doors during California\u2019s militarized immigration crackdown.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s ICE Arrests Non-Criminals Despite Crime-Focused MessageWhat Happened: ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions have surged over 800% under Trump, from 860 in January to 7,800 this month. Internal data shows most were detained for civil immigration violations\u2014not serious crimes.Why It Matters: The surge reveals a politically driven crackdown prioritizing numbers over safety, sweeping up law-abiding immigrants to meet quotas. It\u2019s fueling protests and alarm over due process and human rights violations.Source: ReutersLA protester charged with assaulting officer says he was the one attacked: \u2018I thought I was going to die\u2019What Happened: Jose Mojica, a U.S. citizen and father of four, was charged with assaulting a federal officer during an immigration protest in LA. He says he was choked, slammed to the ground, and injured while trying to de-escalate tensions. Cellphone footage supports parts of his account.Why It Matters: Trump's DOJ is charging injured protesters with federal crimes while unleashing Marines and Border Patrol on civilians. Defense lawyers say it's racial profiling and an attack on free speech\u2014turning protest into a crime.Source: The GuardianTrump Weighs Adding 36 Countries to Travel Ban, Memo SaysWhat Happened: A leaked State Department cable shows Trump is weighing a major expansion of his travel ban to include citizens from 36 more countries\u2014such as Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Venezuela\u2014unless those nations meet new U.S. security requirements within 60 days. This follows earlier restrictions on 19 other countries.Why It Matters: The move signals a sweeping escalation of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, echoing his first-term \u201cMuslim Ban.\u201d Critics warn it weaponizes vague security standards to enact discriminatory and politically motivated exclusions, targeting African, Middle Eastern, and Latin American nations and risking diplomatic fallout.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHead of FEMA's storm response center leaving agency amid leadership exodusWhat Happened: Jeremy Greenberg, head of FEMA\u2019s National Response Coordination Center, resigned just two weeks into hurricane season, following the exits of other top disaster-response officials. The departures come as Trump pushes to reduce FEMA\u2019s role, saying states should \u201cwean\u201d off federal disaster aid.Why It Matters: The collapse of FEMA\u2019s leadership threatens the nation\u2019s ability to respond to crises. With hurricane season underway, Trump\u2019s dismantling of federal emergency infrastructure puts millions of Americans at risk.Source: CBS NewsNew GOP bill would protect AI companies from lawsuits if they offer transparencyWhat Happened: Sen. Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation shielding AI developers from civil liability if they meet transparency standards, while affirming that professionals remain accountable for decisions made using AI. Why It Matters: As AI reshapes industries from healthcare to finance, this bill aims to encourage development while preserving guardrails. But paired with Trump\u2019s push to preempt state AI rules for a decade, critics warn it could create a regulatory vacuum, benefiting Big Tech at the public\u2019s expense.Source: NBC NewsTrump Medicaid Cuts Could Devastate Rural Health Services, Hospitals WarnWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax proposal includes $785 billion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, endangering rural hospitals already struggling to stay afloat. Healthcare leaders warn of widespread closures and reduced care in poor, high-need areas.Why It Matters: Nearly half of rural hospitals are losing money, and Medicaid is a lifeline for millions. The proposed cuts risk triggering a healthcare collapse in small-town America, putting pressure on GOP senators to act before the July 4 deadline.Source: ReutersThe Department of Energy Is Quietly Slashing Disability RightsWhat Happened: The Department of Energy is repealing a decades-old rule mandating disability access in new federally funded buildings, effective July 15. The rollback was quietly announced in the Federal Register with no public input.Why It Matters: Disability advocates see this as a trial balloon for wider civil rights dismantling. Source: Mother Jones\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Returns to G-7 He Once Loathed as Iran Crisis IntensifiesWhat Happened: Trump arrived at the G-7 summit in Canada just days after Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, while conflict in the region intensifies. As Trump promotes American energy and AI, other leaders are downplaying divisive issues like Ukraine and climate, hoping to avoid confrontation. Trump has already sparked backlash for consulting Putin\u2014not allies\u2014about the Iran crisis.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s return to the world stage highlights the G-7\u2019s fraying unity. His embrace of authoritarian figures, disdain for collective action, and disruptive diplomacy erode trust among allies and threaten the group\u2019s role as a bulwark for democracy.Source: BloombergNato drafts one-page communiqu\u00e9 to suit Trump\u2019s attention spanWhat Happened: NATO leaders plan to issue a one-page communiqu\u00e9 at the upcoming summit in The Hague, designed to align with Trump\u2019s short attention span and minimize friction. The document reportedly endorses Trump\u2019s demand for member states to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP.Why It Matters: NATO\u2019s decision to adapt its core messaging for Trump signals a troubling shift\u2014placing alliance cohesion at risk to appease one leader. This weakens the alliance\u2019s strategic clarity and provides Russia with another opportunity to exploit divisions and erode collective defense commitments.Source: The TelegraphRussian aircraft intercepted over Baltic, Poland saysWhat Happened: A Russian Il-20 reconnaissance aircraft crossed two kilometers into Polish airspace over the Baltic Sea, prompting a scramble from two British fighter jets stationed in Poland. The aircraft was intercepted and identified before exiting the airspace.Why It Matters: This is the latest in a string of provocative Russian actions testing NATO\u2019s eastern defenses. With tensions already high, each airspace breach risks escalation and underscores the alliance\u2019s need for constant vigilance.Source: ReutersIran and Israel Trade Airstrikes for Third Day as Nuclear Talks CollapseWhat Happened: Israel and Iran continued exchanging deadly airstrikes after Israel\u2019s surprise attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Over 400 are reported dead in Iran, 13 in Israel, and talks between the U.S. and Iran in Oman have collapsed. Iran accused the U.S. of complicity, while Trump warned Tehran and claimed he could broker peace.Source: CBS NewsTrump Says 'It's Possible' US Gets Involved in Israel-Iran ConflictWhat Happened: Trump said the U.S. isn\u2019t currently involved in Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran but admitted \u201cit\u2019s possible we could get involved.\u201d He confirmed a long call with Putin and floated Russia as a mediator, while Iran canceled nuclear talks and blamed the U.S. for backing Israel.Source: ABC NewsMacron visits Greenland in show of support for territory coveted by TrumpWhat Happened: French President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland ahead of the G-7 summit to affirm EU support after Trump renewed threats to \"get\" the island for the U.S. Macron met local leaders aboard a Danish naval frigate and urged respect for Greenland\u2019s territorial integrity.Why It Matters: The visit rebukes Trump\u2019s imperial posturing and threats to illegally annex Greenland. Macron\u2019s show of solidarity underscores Europe\u2019s alarm over U.S. aggression. Source: The Washington PostFrom Day 144 tracker Hegseth testifies Pentagon has \"plans for any contingency\" when asked about taking over Greenland by forceWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth told Congress that the Pentagon has \"plans for any contingency,\" including military takeovers of Greenland and Panama. Pressed by Rep. Adam Smith on whether this included invading Denmark, Hegseth didn\u2019t deny it, saying planners prepare for \u201cwhatever\u2019s needed.\u201d A Republican lawmaker later tried to walk back the comments, but Hegseth held firm on the Pentagon\u2019s broad planning mandate. Trump has previously said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%.\u201dWhy It Matters: The acknowledgment underscores how Trump\u2019s second term has normalized military contingency planning for seizing foreign territory\u2014echoing imperial ambitions and raising alarms about U.S. global credibility, diplomacy, and respect for sovereignty.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump sees peace between Iran and Israel soon, eyes Putin roleWhat Happened: As Iran-Israel tensions escalate, Trump claimed peace is \u201ccoming soon\u201d and floated Putin as a potential \u201cmediator.\u201d He offered no specifics but confirmed he spoke to Putin about the Middle East.Why It Matters: The idea of Russia \u201cmediating\u201d while waging a genocidal war and aiding Iran\u2019s nuclear program is absurd. But Trump seizes every opportunity to normalize Putin and rehabilitate Russia on the global stage.Source: ReutersUS Opposes European Push to Lower G-7\u2019s Russia Oil Price CapWhat Happened: The U.S. is blocking EU and UK efforts to lower the G7\u2019s Russian oil price cap from $60 to $45, despite pressure to tighten restrictions. Trump\u2019s refusal undercuts momentum for a unified move to slash Moscow\u2019s war profits.Why It Matters: Trump continues aiding Russia\u2014this time by blocking tougher oil sanctions\u2014undermining the West\u2019s ability to cut off Moscow\u2019s war funds. His obstruction fractures allied unity, as he uses U.S. policy to protect Russian interests.Source: BloombergWithout a hint of irony, Putin offers condolences for 'civilian casualties' in Iran, condemns Israel's 'violations' of UN CharterWhat Happened: Putin offered condolences to Iran over civilian casualties from Israeli strikes and condemned Israel\u2019s actions as violations of international law\u2014just hours after Russia killed Ukrainian civilians in a massive missile assault.Why It Matters: The hypocrisy is staggering. Putin has the nerve to pose as a \u201cdefender of international norms,\u201d while Russia is actively committing genocide and war crimes.Source: Kyiv IndependentWhite House and DHS Amplify White Nationalist Propaganda PosterWhat Happened: The White House and Department of Homeland Security shared an image urging Americans to report \u201cforeign invaders\u201d via an ICE tip line\u2014a graphic originally created by a white nationalist user who praises Hitler and uses slurs online. The user celebrated the repost, saying, \u201cOur efforts are coming out of the White House!\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump and his officials continue openly echoing white supremacist messaging\u2014on official government channels. This is how extremist ideology becomes normalized, disguised as policy.Source: Mother JonesRight-Wingers Sound Like They WANT Anti-Trump Protests To Turn ViolentWhat Happened: As millions were preparing to march nationwide against Trump\u2019s authoritarianism, right-wing leaders ramped up violent rhetoric and activated National Guard units. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis implied protesters hit by cars would be at fault, while sheriffs in Alabama and Florida threatened harsh crackdowns, framing protests as potential \u201criots.\u201dWhy It Matters: The inflammatory stance reveals a calculated effort to criminalize dissent and stage a show of state power. With Trump militarizing streets and targeting democratic institutions, the right wants to bait protesters.Source: Talking Points MemoFar-Right Threats Surged Ahead of \u2018No Kings\u2019 ProtestsWhat Happened: Extremist groups tied to the Proud Boys are spreading violent threats ahead of Saturday\u2019s national \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests against Trump. Online posts call for shooting protesters, doxxing organizers, and circulating state-backed anti-immigrant propaganda through far-right channels.Why It Matters: This fusion of government messaging with extremist intimidation tactics mirrors authoritarian regimes. It signals a dangerous shift toward normalizing political violence in America, targeting dissenters with stochastic terrorism.Source: The Independent and Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsOil Prices Surge as Israel Strikes Iranian Energy FacilitiesWhat Happened: Oil prices jumped over 3% after Israeli strikes hit Iran\u2019s South Pars gas field and a key oil depot near Tehran. Iran responded with missile attacks on Haifa and is now threatening to shut the Strait of Hormuz, escalating the conflict into a global energy flashpoint.Why It Matters: With oil already up 13% this week, markets are on edge. A blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could send prices soaring past $100 a barrel, reigniting inflation and destabilizing fragile global economies.Source: CNBCUS-China trade truce leaves military-use rare earth issue unresolved, sources sayWhat Happened: The U.S. and China reached a temporary trade truce in London, but Beijing refused to lift restrictions on rare earth exports vital to American weapons systems. China tied any mineral access to the rollback of U.S. AI chip export bans, keeping the standoff alive.Why It Matters: China\u2019s grip on rare earths gives it major leverage over U.S. defense capabilities. Trump\u2019s trade tactics risk backfiring by leaving critical military supply chains exposed to geopolitical blackmail.Source: Reuters\u2018Stay Below the Radar\u2019: Corporate America Falls Silent Under Trump\u2019s Second TermWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return, major U.S. companies have gone silent on social issues, pulling back diversity efforts and public stances to avoid retaliation. Despite big pledges, firms face threats, tariffs, or public shaming if they challenge the regime.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s authoritarian tactics have cowed corporate America into compliance, gutting its role as a check on power. The MAGA loyalty test is reshaping business behavior\u2014and accelerating the collapse of civic courage.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Millions Across US Turn Out for \u2018No Kings\u2019 Protests Against Donald TrumpWhat Happened: On the day of Trump\u2019s military parade in Washington, 5-7 million joined \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests in all 50 states and abroad, denouncing Trump\u2019s authoritarianism, immigration crackdowns, and politicized troop deployments.

Some were paid by organizations tied to pardoned allies, fake electors, and Trump\\u2019s legal defense operations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The disclosures highlight how Trump\\u2019s orbit has become a money-making machine, where loyalty is rewarded with cash and influence\\u2014like in Russia.

Many clips come from far-right influencers and depict soldiers in U.S. streets to glorify mass deportations and deter protests.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian spectacle designed to normalize fear and condition Americans to accept military presence in civilian life.

He defended his foreign policy record and claimed \\u201Csuccess\\u201D in global conflicts\\u2014moments before abruptly ending the call to speak with Putin.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is making U.S. policy\\u2014at home and abroad\\u2014about himself.
