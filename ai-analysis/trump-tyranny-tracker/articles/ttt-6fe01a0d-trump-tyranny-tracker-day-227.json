Wyden pushes Treasury Department release Epstein banking files to finance committeeWhat Happened: Sen. Ron Wyden pressed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to release Epstein-related financial records, including suspicious activity reports linking Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and dozens of associates. Treasury has twice refused, dismissing the request as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201dWhy It Matters: The files could expose how elites funneled money to Epstein for trafficking and laundering schemes. Treasury\u2019s stonewalling underscores that Trump\u2019s regime is shielding him and his allies and burying the evidence.Source: ABC NewsTrump is primed to cash in on the crypto gold rush he\u2019s helping createWhat Happened: Trump and his family have embedded themselves deep in the crypto industry, launching World Liberty Financial with Steve Witkoff, promoting tokens like WLFI and USD1, and pivoting Trump Media into a crypto treasury. These ventures\u2014backed by some anonymous foreign investors\u2014have already netted the family hundreds of millions in fees and billions more on paper.Why It Matters: Trump is shaping U.S. policy to supercharge a crypto market he and his sons directly profit from, blurring the line between state power and personal enrichment. This is the worst presidential self-dealing on a global scale.Source: CNNTrump Advisers Have Discussed a Job for Adams if He Quits Mayor\u2019s RaceWhat Happened: Trump advisers have floated offering Mayor Eric Adams and GOP candidate Curtis Sliwa government posts to clear the field in New York\u2019s mayoral race. The maneuver is designed to strengthen Andrew Cuomo\u2019s third-party challenge against Democratic front-runner Zohran Mamdani.Why It Matters: Trump is interfering in a local race, dangling jobs while his DOJ dropped charges on Adams, earlier this year. They are using federal power to interfere in New York City politics.Source: New York TimesWhy Lawmakers Don\u2019t Want to Ban Their Own Stock TradingWhat Happened: Rep. Rob Bresnahan campaigned on banning congressional stock trading but has since become one of the most active traders in Congress, making more than 600 trades this year. Why It Matters: Congress is dragging its feet on reform that 86% of Americans want. By clinging to personal profits, lawmakers are fueling distrust and proving why stock bans are essential.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump suggests National Guard could go into New Orleans, a blue city in a red stateWhat Happened: Trump floated deploying the National Guard into New Orleans, a Democratic-led city in Republican-run Louisiana, claiming he could \u201cstraighten it out in two weeks.\u201d The threat follows his ongoing militarization of Washington, D.C., and vows to send troops into Chicago and Baltimore.Why It Matters: Trump is expanding his use of federal troops beyond Washington, D.C., pushing the National Guard to invade other Democratic-led cities against local opposition. By turning the Guard into a political tool, he\u2019s deepening the regime\u2019s assault on blue strongholds.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsUS judge questions DOJ decision to drop Boeing independent monitorWhat Happened: A Texas judge pressed the Justice Department over its decision to scrap an independent monitor in a non-prosecution deal with Boeing tied to two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people. Families of victims objected, saying the agreement lets Boeing off easy without real accountability.Why It Matters: Dropping independent oversight signals corporate impunity, where even deadly negligence is met with sweetheart deals. It shows how Trump\u2019s DOJ prioritizes protecting powerful companies over delivering justice for victims\u2019 families.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s DOJ seeks voting equipment in Missouri ahead of 2026 electionWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ tried to seize Dominion voting machines from two Missouri counties used in 2020, but clerks refused, citing state law and chain of custody rules. The move comes as Trump vows to ban voting machines and mail ballots, preparing sweeping executive orders to reshape elections.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the DOJ to chase his stolen-election lie. By targeting voting machines years later, he\u2019s turning conspiracy theories into government policy \u2014 a blatant attempt to rig future elections and destroy state control over voting.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Admin\u2019s Cuts to Harvard Funding Ruled UnconstitutionalWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered the government to restore $2.2 billion in Harvard research funding, ruling that Trump\u2019s freeze was retaliatory, violated the First Amendment, Title VI, and the APA, and used antisemitism as a smokescreen for an ideologically driven assault on universities.Why It Matters: The ruling slaps down the White House\u2019s bid to weaponize federal dollars to coerce campuses into political compliance.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsCalifornia bill would require parents be notified when immigration enforcement is at schoolWhat Happened: California lawmakers passed a bill requiring schools to notify parents and teachers when immigration enforcement personnel appear on campus. The measure also extends to state universities and community colleges, requiring alerts to be sent to students and staff, and bars ICE from entering schools and hospitals without a warrant.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet is spreading fear in immigrant communities and schools. The law aims to keep schools safe zones and students safe.Source: Associated PressImmigration Detentions of Military Family Members Spark Lawmaker ProbeWhat Happened: Dozens of Democratic lawmakers opened an investigation after reports that noncitizen service members and their relatives are being detained. The probe demands answers from DHS and the Pentagon on why long-standing protections for military families are being abandoned.Why It Matters: Deporting service members\u2019 families shatters a decades-old promise that military sacrifice earns protection. Trump\u2019s policy shift undermines morale, betrays troops, and treats immigrant soldiers as expendable even as they defend America.Source: Military.comHouse Dems Blast Labor Department For Abandoning Disabled WorkersWhat Happened: Six House Democrats, led by Rep. Lateefah Simon, accused Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer of dismantling protections for disabled federal contract workers. They cited delays in investigations, halted compliance reviews, and rule changes that scrap hiring goals under the Rehabilitation Act.Why It Matters: Gutting disability rights enforcement strips away decades of progress and leaves workers vulnerable to discrimination. By abandoning oversight of major federal contractors, the Labor Department is erasing protections for the disabled. Source: Mother JonesMore details emerge about the 76 Guatemalan children whose deportations were stopped by a federal judgeWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s attempt to disappear 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, citing violations of due process and federal law. Attorneys say the minors, many survivors of abuse or trafficking, would face \u201cgrave and irreparable harm\u201d if returned.Why It Matters: By ripping kids from their beds and trying to send them back to danger, Trump is flouting U.S. law and international protections for child refugees.Source: NPRGuatemalan document undercuts U.S. claims on child deportationsWhat Happened: A leaked Guatemalan government report shows that many families of unaccompanied minors the U.S. tried to disappear last weekend wanted their children to stay in the U.S., contradicting Trump officials\u2019 claims they were eager for reunification. The report found 59 out of 115 families expressed anger at the prospect of forced return, calling it intimidation.Why It Matters: This shreds the regime\u2019s lies and exposes its deportation drive as cruel and built on false pretenses. By twisting families\u2019 wishes, DHS is forcing traumatized children back into danger and proving its immigration policy is rooted in deception and brutality.Source: ReutersTrump administration to end temporary status of another 268,000 Venezuelan migrants, urging them to self-deportWhat Happened: Trump officials announced they will end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 270,000 Venezuelans, revoking work permits and legal protections within 60 days. The move follows earlier terminations that already stripped protections from 350,000 others.Why It Matters: Forcing Venezuelans to \u201cself-deport\u201d abandons families fleeing dictatorship and crisis, weaponizing cruelty and immigration law against a vulnerable community. Source: CBS NewsTrump administration to open new ICE facility at notorious Louisiana prisonWhat Happened: Trump officials are opening \u201cCamp 57,\u201d a new ICE internment center inside Louisiana\u2019s notorious Angola prison, once a slave plantation and now the country\u2019s largest maximum-security facility. Officials say it will hold 400 undocumented men accused of crimes, touting it as a model for future immigration crackdowns.Why It Matters: Angola\u2019s history of forced labor, deadly heat, and medical neglect makes it synonymous with human rights abuse. Turning it into an ICE camp expands Trump\u2019s network of internment camps, weaponizing one of America\u2019s most notorious prisons to terrorize migrants.Source: CNN\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFlorida plans to become first state to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandatesWhat Happened: Florida announced plans to abolish all vaccine mandates for schoolchildren, making it the first state to dismantle this long-standing public health safeguard. Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo framed requirements as \u201cimmoral,\u201d aligning with RFK Jr. and his anti-vaccine agenda.Why It Matters: Scrapping mandates overturns decades of science that kept schools safe from outbreaks. The move will cause a resurgence of preventable diseases, endangering children, families, and communities for the sake of extremist ideology.Source: Associated PressOver 1,000 HHS staffers call on Trump to fire RFK Jr. for \"endangering the nation's health\"What Happened: More than 1,000 current and former HHS staffers signed a letter demanding RFK Jr. resign or be fired for \u201cendangering the nation\u2019s health.\u201d The protest follows the purge of CDC Director Susan Monarez, mass resignations of senior officials, and sweeping changes to vaccine approval under Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine leadership.Why It Matters: The revolt highlights a public health system in collapse because Trump empowered a conspiracy extremist to run HHS. By sidelining science and weaponizing health policy, the regime is leaving Americans vulnerable to disease and chaos.Source: CBS NewsDemocratic senator says classified meeting with intel agency is canceled after Loomer\u2019s criticismWhat Happened: Sen. Mark Warner said a classified oversight meeting with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency was abruptly canceled after Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy extremist, publicly attacked it. Warner blasted the move as proof that Trump\u2019s allies are dictating intelligence access.Why It Matters: Canceling congressional oversight at the behest of a fringe extremist shows how politicized intelligence has become under Trump. Letting Loomer dictate spy agency operations shreds accountability, undermines national security, and endangers America.Source: Associated Press and New York TimesUS nuclear safety regulators say their jobs could be at risk under TrumpWhat Happened: At a Senate hearing, two of the three remaining Nuclear Regulatory Commission members said they fear Trump could purge them if they block his push to fast-track reactor approvals. Trump has ordered staff cuts and wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.Why It Matters: Pressuring regulators to approve reactors without proper oversight risks catastrophic safety failures. Trump\u2019s purge of nuclear watchdogs turns a critical safety agency into a rubber stamp for industry expansion.Source: ReutersDemocrats call for firing of January 6 defendant who works at justice departmentWhat Happened: Senate Democrats urged Pam Bondi to fire Jared Wise, a former FBI agent and January 6 insurrectionist who shouted \u201cKill \u2019em!\u201d at police during the Capitol attack. Despite felony charges, Trump pardoned Wise and later installed him as a senior adviser in the DOJ\u2019s \u201cweaponization\u201d unit targeting political rivals.Why It Matters: Hiring an insurrectionist to help run the Justice Department shreds any pretense of rule of law. Trump is rewarding those who violently attacked the Capitol, turning the DOJ into a safe haven for coup plotters and a weapon against his enemies.Source: The GuardianStaff losses at FEMA could compromise disaster response, says watchdog agencyWhat Happened: A GAO report found that 2,500 FEMA employees\u2014including 24 senior leaders\u2014have quit since January, leaving the agency understaffed and unprepared for peak hurricane and wildfire season. Trump has announced plans to shut down FEMA after this season, shifting disaster response to the states.Why It Matters: Gutting FEMA leaves millions vulnerable just as extreme weather worsens. By hollowing out federal disaster response, Trump is dismantling a safety net that saves lives, replacing it with chaos and leaving Americans to fend for themselves.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchChina parades its military might, and its friends, in a defiant display for the U.S.What Happened: Xi Jinping hosted a massive military parade in Beijing, unveiling new nuclear-capable weapons alongside leaders from Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The show of force, branded the \u201cAxis of Upheaval,\u201d highlighted unity against the West even as Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine grinds on.Why It Matters: The spectacle cements an authoritarian bloc openly defying U.S. power, with China giving Putin cover while North Korea and Iran supply troops and drones. Together, they\u2019re signaling a new Cold War order and sending a message to the U.S. as Trump praises them.Source: NBC NewsUS Warns of More Strikes After Attack on Purported Drug BoatWhat Happened: Trump carried out a deadly strike on a Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 people it claimed were drug traffickers. Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio defended the action, promising more strikes, while Colombian President Gustavo Petro called it murder, and experts questioned whether the vessel was even carrying drugs.Why It Matters: Trump is now carrying out extrajudicial killings and bragging about it, with the U.S. bypassing arrests and due process to execute suspects. By offering no evidence and discarding the rule of law, Trump is turning anti-drug policy into open-season warfare that destabilizes the region and breaks international laws.Source: BloombergTrump Ally Says Will Seek Norway Visa Denials Over CaterpillarWhat Happened: Sen. Lindsey Graham threatened to push Trump to deny visas to executives of Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund after it divested $2.1 billion from Caterpillar. The fund cited Israel\u2019s use of Caterpillar bulldozers to demolish Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank.Why It Matters: Graham\u2019s retaliation shows how Trump allies are willing to weaponize U.S. immigration policy and tariffs to punish foreign governments and companies that criticize Israel. Turning a corporate divestment into a diplomatic standoff will further fracture ties with U.S. allies.Source: BloombergUN Inspectors Warn of Lost Knowledge Over Iran Nuclear WorkWhat Happened: The IAEA says Iran\u2019s ban on nuclear inspections since June has caused a critical loss of knowledge about its uranium stockpile. Inspectors haven\u2019t been able to verify near-bomb-grade uranium since Israeli and U.S. attacks destroyed parts of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Why It Matters: For the first time in two decades, the world has no verified accounting of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium \u2014 enough for multiple nuclear weapons. Trump\u2019s June strikes damaged facilities but erased decades of inspection access, heightening the risk of nuclear escalation in the Middle East.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchNATO scrambles jets as Russia launches more than 500 drones, missiles at UkraineWhat Happened: Russia unleashed more than 500 drones and missiles overnight, striking cities across Ukraine and murdering at least 15 people. NATO scrambled jets from Poland as debris and explosions hit Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Lutsk, and Kyiv.Why It Matters: Russia continues escalating its genocidal assault, striking civilians and energy hubs on NATO\u2019s doorstep to send a message. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues providing cover for Russia.Source: ABC NewsFears of Russian hit campaign grow as another nationalist politician is murdered in UkraineWhat Happened: Former parliament speaker Andriy Parubiy was assassinated in Lviv, the latest in a string of assassinations of Ukrainian leaders. Authorities say the suspect confessed, admitted contact with Russians, and sought a prisoner swap\u2014fueling suspicions of Moscow\u2019s involvement.Why It Matters: The assassinations of Orange and EuroMaidan leaders continue Russia\u2019s long tradition of hunting Ukrainians. Each assassination is part of terrorist Russia\u2019s plan to sow fear, destabilize politics, and eliminate Ukraine\u2019s pro-European leadership.Source: Kyiv IndependentPodcast of Hegseth church network airs far-right and Christian nationalist viewsWhat Happened: A flagship podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, where Pete Hegseth is a member, has become a platform for Christian nationalist and far-right rhetoric. Recent guests praised authoritarianism, backed Russia and China over liberal democracy, and endorsed criminalizing homosexuality in Uganda.Why It Matters: Hegseth\u2019s church network is disseminating extremist, anti-democratic ideology straight into the U.S. defense leadership. By fusing Christian nationalism with pro-Kremlin propaganda, it turns faith into a weapon for authoritarian politics and national security sabotage.Source: The GuardianDonald Trump killed the Jeffrey Epstein story on the rightWhat Happened: MAGA media figures abruptly stopped covering the Jeffrey Epstein story after Trump demanded allies drop it, despite fresh revelations in Congress and new victim testimony. Why It Matters: This is a cover-up in plain sight. Trump has turned Fox, Newsmax, and MAGA influencers into obedient propagandists, silencing Epstein\u2019s victims and erasing his own ties to protect him at all costs.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsJob openings data falls to levels rarely seen since pandemicWhat Happened: Job openings dropped to 7.18 million in July, one of the lowest readings since the pandemic, according to new Labor Department data. The figure fell short of expectations and highlights mounting evidence of a weakening labor market.Why It Matters: The decline signals a sharp cooling in hiring, raising fears of a broader economic slowdown. With fewer opportunities available, workers face growing difficulty finding jobs as cracks spread through the post-pandemic recovery.Source: CNBCThe Biggest U.S. Oil Companies Are Eliminating Thousands of JobsWhat Happened: ConocoPhillips announced it will cut up to 25% of its workforce, roughly 3,250 jobs, following its $17 billion Marathon Oil acquisition. Chevron and other majors are also downsizing as crude prices hover around $64 a barrel.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s policy gifts to fossil fuels, market realities are forcing mass layoffs. The industry\u2019s push for record production now collides with shrinking payrolls, showing how oil profits come at the expense of workers even in a deregulated environment.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/6- Next Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Washington, Oregon and California governors form a health alliance in rebuke of Trump administrationWhat Happened: The governors of Washington, Oregon, and California announced a joint health alliance to counter Trump\u2019s politicization of the CDC under RFK Jr. The pact will coordinate vaccine and public health guidance as federal leadership pushes anti-vaccine policies and purges top CDC officials.Source: Associated PressUtah\u2019s congressional map must be redrawn now, judge rulesWhat Happened: A Utah judge ordered lawmakers to immediately redraw the state\u2019s congressional map, ruling they wrongly scrapped an independent commission\u2019s proposal in favor of a GOP-friendly plan. The court rejected claims that the job couldn\u2019t be finished before the 2026 midterms.Source: Associated PressTrump administration agrees to restore health websites and dataWhat Happened: Trump officials agreed to reinstate federal health and science websites it had deleted under a settlement with doctors\u2019 groups. Pages covering pregnancy risks, opioid-use disorder, and AIDS were removed after Trump ordered agencies to strip references to \u201cgender.\u201dSource: Associated PressAppeals Court Blocks Trump\u2019s Use of Alien Enemies Act to Deport VenezuelansWhat Happened: A federal appeals court struck down Trump\u2019s attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to summarily deport Venezuelan immigrants he labeled as gang members. The judges ruled that mass migration is not equivalent to a military invasion, undercutting Trump\u2019s legal justification.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers9/6 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action2,500 \u2014 FEMA staff lost since January, including 24 senior leaders, according to GAO2 \u2014 Missouri counties where Trump\u2019s DOJ tried to seize Dominion voting machines used in 20206 \u2014 House Democrats calling out Labor Secretary Chavez-DeRemer for dismantling disability protections76 \u2014 Guatemalan children whose midnight disappearances were blocked by a federal judge1,000+ \u2014 HHS staffers demanding RFK Jr.\u2019s ouster for \u201cendangering the nation\u2019s health\u201d500+ \u2014 Drones and missiles Russia launched overnight in a genocidal assault on Ukraine, killing 1525% \u2014 Share of ConocoPhillips\u2019 workforce set to be cut, eliminating about 3,250 jobs7.18 million \u2014 Job openings in July, near pandemic-era lows268,000 \u2014 Venezuelans losing TPS protections within 60 days under Trump\u2019s new order$2.2 billion \u2014 Harvard research funding illegally frozen and now ordered restored by federal court\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump\u2019s ICE is disappearing American citizens \u2014 How far will the regime be allowed to go in bypassing due process and constitutional protections?FEMA is collapsing under Trump\u2019s cuts \u2014 Will hurricane season turn deadly before he shuts it entirely?Trump\u2019s crypto empire is ballooning \u2014 Will anyone investigate which foreign investors might be using it to buy influence in U.S. policy?Nuclear safety is being gutted \u2014 How long before Trump\u2019s reactor push turns into a crisis?Trump is militarizing America\u2019s cities \u2014 Will the National Guard be sent into another blue city, and how long before occupation goes nationwide?The regime is trying to seize election power \u2014 Will courts block DOJ before it takes control of voting systems, state by state?Far-right extremist Loomer is dictating intelligence access \u2014 Will Congress step in to stop Trump\u2019s allies from endangering national security and shredding oversight?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are rising, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Authoritarian Tactics \u2014 From deploying the National Guard into blue cities to opening internment camps at Angola prison, Trump is normalizing military and detention crackdowns as tools of control.Weaponized Institutions \u2014 DOJ\u2019s hunt for voting machines, cushy deals for Boeing, and hiring of January 6 insurrectionists show how Trump has turned the justice system into a partisan enforcement arm.Campus Crackdown \u2014 Harvard\u2019s court win is a rare rebuke, but Trump\u2019s broader campaign to weaponize funding threats shows his drive to crush academic freedom and force universities into MAGA ideological conformity.Immigration as Punishment \u2014 From ripping Guatemalan children from their beds to forcing Venezuelans to self-deport, Trump\u2019s policies use cruelty as both weapon and message.Public Health Sabotage \u2014 RFK Jr.\u2019s purge of CDC scientists and Florida\u2019s plan to eliminate childhood vaccine mandates reveal how anti-science extremism now drives national health policy.Axis Rising \u2014 Beijing\u2019s military parade with Putin, Kim, and Iran cements a global authoritarian bloc, emboldened by Trump\u2019s praise and U.S. retreat from leadership.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

All distressing news but necessary to know. The other day I saw journalist Paola Ramos on MSNBC. She was discussing Venezuelan migrants self deporting. She said none of them were willing to navigate the extremely dangerous Darien Gap again and were instead renting boats that took them on a circumvented route in the Caribbean back to Venezuela. I suspect that the boat bombed was full of migrants trying to return home not drug dealers.
