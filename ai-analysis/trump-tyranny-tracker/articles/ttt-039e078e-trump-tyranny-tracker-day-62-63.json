Photo by Lillian HammanShareWelcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Is Positioned to Profit Off Billions in New Government ContractsWhat Happened: SpaceX is securing billions in new government contracts, thanks to policies pushed by Trump and Musk\u2019s allies embedded in federal agencies. Contracts span military logistics, broadband expansion, NASA missions, and missile defense. SpaceX has also gained access to federal launch sites and secured spectrum rights over objections from competitors.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s grip on the government, while holding lucrative federal contracts, presents an unparalleled conflict of interest\u2014giving him the power to rewrite policy for his profit. Corruption faces no meaningful checks with oversight agencies dismantled and ethics watchdogs silenced.Source: The New York TimesTrump Turns White House Easter Event Into Corporate ShowcaseWhat Happened: The White House is offering corporate sponsorships for its Easter Egg Roll, allowing companies to pay up to $200,000 for branding, exclusive perks, and private White House access. This violates federal rules prohibiting the use of public office for private gain and is part of a broader pattern of Trump monetizing the presidency.Why It Matters: The Easter event is another avenue for Trump\u2019s corruption, granting corporate donors influence in exchange for cash. The follows similar controversies, including Tesla\u2019s exclusive White House car show and Trump\u2019s personal cryptocurrency promotion.Source: The New York TimesPentagon changed course for Musk visit after report about him viewing China war plans: OfficialsWhat Happened: Musk was supposed to meet with the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon but was instead shuffled into a private meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after The New York Times exposed plans to brief him on secret China plans. Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked access to national security discussions raises major red flags\u2014especially as billions pour in from China to Musk companies. This is exactly why a free press is crucial\u2014to expose backroom deals and hold power accountable.Source: ABC NewsTrump Rewards Key Allies Who Helped Him Take Back the White HouseWhat Happened: Trump has swiftly rewarded groups that backed his return to power, delivering major policy wins for Bitcoin advocates, labor unions, and Native American tribes. He ordered the Federal Reserve to hold Bitcoin, backed full federal recognition for North Carolina\u2019s Lumbee Tribe, and appointed a union-friendly Labor Secretary after Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien withheld endorsement.Why It Matters: Trump is buying loyalty from unlikely allies, but his deals come with ethical baggage\u2014especially in crypto. If he fails to deliver, these groups could turn on him just as quickly.Source: CNNTrump and Musk Intensify Efforts in Wisconsin Supreme Court RaceWhat Happened: Trump endorsed conservative candidate Brad Schimel in Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court race, warning that a liberal win would derail his movement. Musk\u2019s PAC has poured $13 million into the race and is offering Wisconsin voters $100 for their contact details and petition signatures\u2014building a direct contact list to mobilize Trump supporters before the April 1 election.Why It Matters: The court\u2019s balance could determine the future of abortion rights in Wisconsin and redistricting that currently favors Republicans. The unprecedented spending and data-driven voter outreach highlight how Trump and Musk are reshaping political influence tactics.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump finds new target in crusade against judges: Nationwide injunctionsWhat Happened: Trump is demanding Congress and the Supreme Court strip federal judges of their ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have blocked key parts of his extremist and illegal agenda\u2014including mass deportations, the military transgender ban, and the firing of federal workers. Stephen Miller, argues courts should have no authority over executive actions.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on the judiciary\u2019s ability to check executive overreach. If successful, it would gut judicial oversight, giving Trump unchecked dictatorial power to impose policies without legal restraint. Judges are one of the last obstacles to full authoritarian control.Source: CBS NewsTrump Pushes for Judiciary Purge, Signals Long Fight to Expand PowerWhat Happened: Trump is escalating attacks on the judiciary, calling for the impeachment of a Washington judge overseeing a lawsuit against his mass deportation policies. His regime is also pushing to limit courts\u2019 ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have repeatedly blocked his agenda.Why It Matters: Trump is attempting to dismantle judicial checks on his power, punishing judges who rule against him, and working to strip courts of their authority. This highlights a broader push\u2014one where legal challenges to his policies become nearly impossible.Source: BloombergTrump instructs DOJ to sanction law firms over \u2018vexatious\u2019 litigation against governmentWhat Happened: Trump directed the DOJ to punish law firms for \"vexatious\" lawsuits against the government, specifically targeting immigration lawyers. He also ordered a review of firms that have litigated against his regime over the past eight years.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the legal system to intimidate and silence firms litigating against his regime. His crackdown could deter legitimate legal challenges, eroding judicial independence and due process. This is an authoritarian attack on the legal profession, setting a dangerous precedent where lawyers fear retaliation for upholding the law.Source: The HillTrump Orders Full Data Access for Designated Officials, Expanding DOGE\u2019s ReachWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order granting any officials designated by the president or agency heads full access to all unclassified federal records, IT systems, and data\u2014including third-party databases linked to federally funded state programs. Agencies must eliminate any internal rules restricting data sharing within 30 days.Why It Matters: This gives Trump\u2019s hand-picked operatives, including those from Musk, sweeping access to sensitive government data, overriding agency policies designed to protect personal and institutional information. With prior reports of improper data sharing, this will lead to mass privacy violations and political abuse of federal records.Source: FedScoop\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsIRS Nears Data-Sharing Deal With ICE to Target Undocumented ImmigrantsWhat Happened: The IRS is close to finalizing an agreement allowing ICE to access confidential taxpayer data to aid in deportations. The deal would let ICE cross-check the names and addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants against IRS databases. Career officials at the IRS have raised alarms, citing legal and ethical concerns over using tax information for immigration enforcement.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the IRS to aid mass deportations, shredding taxpayer confidentiality, and expanding government overreach. Today, it\u2019s being used against immigrants\u2014tomorrow, it could be used against citizens.Source: ABC NewsPam Bondi warns Jasmine Crockett to \u2018tread very carefully\u2019 in what she says about Elon MuskWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi warned Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) to \"tread very carefully\" after she supported nationwide protests against Musk. Bondi also vowed to prosecute demonstrators, labeling Tesla-related vandalism as \"domestic terrorism,\" while the DOJ pursues charges against protesters.Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s threats signal a dangerous escalation\u2014weaponizing the DOJ to intimidate critics and suppress dissent. The Trump regime is using law enforcement to shield Musk from public backlash, threatening to rein in protests while letting real threats go unchecked. This is authoritarianism in action.Source: PoliticoThousands of Agents Diverted to Trump\u2019s Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime has reassigned thousands of federal agents from crime-fighting to immigration enforcement, pulling resources from investigating child exploitation, drug cartels, and financial crimes. ATF, DEA, IRS, and even the State Department have been ordered to prioritize immigration operations. Federal prosecutors are overwhelmed with immigration cases, leading to declines in drug and violent crime prosecutions.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting federal law enforcement to fuel mass deportations, making America less safe by shifting focus away from real criminal threats. His regime is using immigration as a pretext to expand unchecked government power, eroding due process and civil liberties.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUniversities Sprint from \u2018We Will Not Cower\u2019 to Appeasing TrumpWhat Happened: Under pressure from Trump, universities are scrambling to align with the regime\u2019s demands, fearing massive funding cuts. Institutions that once vowed to resist are now quietly hiring lobbyists and conceding to Trump\u2019s policies. After losing $400 million in federal funds, Columbia University fully caved setting a dangerous precedent. Proposed legislation could impose punitive taxes on endowments, force schools to cover student loan defaults, and strip funding from institutions deemed \u201ctoo woke.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is not just budget cuts\u2014it\u2019s an authoritarian takeover of higher education. Trump\u2019s goal is to purge academia of dissent, silence critics, and turn universities into propaganda arms of the regime. Research funding, academic freedom, and access to education are at risk as institutions capitulate under financial and political threats.Source: The Wall Street Journal\u201cSend Them to Jail\u201d: GOP Officials Keep Saying Trump Can Arrest People for ProtestingWhat Happened: Trump is arresting and deporting non-citizens for participating in protests, openly equating dissent with criminal activity. Homeland Security officials confirmed they are using intelligence to track and remove foreign students and green card holders engaged in demonstrations Trump deems \"anti-American\" or \"pro-Hamas.\" Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Tommy Tuberville, are backing the crackdown, with Tuberville stating, \"Send them to jail.\"Why It Matters: This is political repression\u2014punishing dissent and criminalizing protest, just like in Russia. Trump is using immigration enforcement as a weapon to silence opposition, setting the stage for broader crackdowns on all free speech and protest.Source: Mother JonesAutocrats roll back rights and rule of law \u2014 and cite Trump\u2019s exampleWhat Happened: Leaders from Hungary to Turkey are escalating attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, free speech, and the rule of law, openly crediting Trump\u2019s return. Hungary banned Pride, Serbia raided civil society groups, and Turkey arrested its top opposition leader\u2014all citing Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies as justification.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s authoritarianism isn\u2019t just a U.S. crisis\u2014it\u2019s empowering strongmen worldwide. By rolling back rights, attacking judges, and gutting democracy at home, he\u2019s giving autocrats the green light to do the same.Source: The Washington PostTrump Pressures Maine Governor for Apology Over Transgender Athlete PolicyWhat Happened: Trump is demanding a \u201cfull-throated apology\u201d from Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) after their public clash over his executive order banning transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports. Trump has since ruled Maine in violation of Title IX and threatened federal action if the state does not reverse its policy by March 27.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to force states into compliance with his anti-trans policies, escalating his attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. His demand for public submission from Mills underscores his authoritarian approach to dissent.Source: The HillTrump Attacks \u2018Distorted\u2019 Portrait in Colorado CapitolWhat Happened: Trump lashed out at his official portrait in the Colorado State Capitol, calling it \u201cintentionally distorted\u201d and claiming it sparked \u201cpublic outrage.\u201d He suggested he\u2019d rather have no portrait than one he finds unflattering and shared alternative images of himself on Truth Social.Why It Matters: Trump's obsession with controlling his image\u2014even in government buildings\u2014reveals his authoritarian instincts and extreme sensitivity to criticism, no matter how trivial.Source: CNN\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDaughter of 1st Black Marine says it's 'unbelievable' to see 'my dad caught up in DEI'What Happened: The Pentagon removed a webpage honoring Alfred Masters, the first Black man to enlist in the Marine Corps, as part of its crackdown on DEI. His daughter, Alfreda Masters, called the move \u201cunbelievable,\u201d emphasizing that her father\u2019s service is American history, not just Black history.Why It Matters: This is an outright rewriting of history, disguised as eliminating \u201cDEI.\u201d Honoring those who broke racial barriers in the military should be nonpartisan, yet Trump\u2019s regime is purging historical recognition under the guise of eliminating \u201cwoke\u201d policies.Source: ABC NewsTrump Shuts Down 3 Watchdog Agencies Overseeing Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security is gutting its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. These offices provided oversight on civil rights issues, detention conditions, and immigration case assistance.Why It Matters: The move comes as Trump accelerates deportations without due process and removes transparency mechanisms that could scrutinize his policies. This is a blatant effort to sidestep accountability and eliminate protections for migrants and asylum seekers.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchGOP Senator Admits Social Security Cuts Are Inevitable Despite Trump\u2019s PromisesWhat Happened: Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said on Meet the Press that politicians are \"not being honest\" when they claim Social Security won\u2019t be touched. While Trump insists he won\u2019t gut Social Security, Curtis argued that changes are unavoidable, especially for younger generations. Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are laying the groundwork for gutting Social Security. Curtis' admission signals that Republicans are preparing to overhaul the program, contradicting Trump\u2019s claims.Source: NBC NewsFEMA Workforce Overhaul Sparks Fears of Agency Collapse Ahead of Hurricane SeasonWhat Happened: Trump has implemented sweeping changes to FEMA\u2019s hiring policies, forcing thousands of employees to reapply for their jobs through the Department of Homeland Security. More than 200 probationary workers have already been fired, and a new policy overhaul threatens to gut the majority of FEMA\u2019s workforce over the next two to four years. Why It Matters: FEMA faces a mass exodus of employees as hurricane season approaches. Gutting the agency\u2019s workforce threatens its ability to respond to hurricanes, wildfires, and other disasters, putting millions of Americans at risk. Source: CBS NewsTrump and DOGE\u2019s Overhaul Throws V.A. Mental Health System Into CrisisWhat Happened: Trump and Musk have imposed changes to the V.A. mental health system. Thousands of providers, including remote therapists, are now required to work from crowded federal offices, compromising patient privacy. Layoffs of nearly 1,900 probationary employees have further strained services, leaving homeless and suicidal veterans at risk.Why It Matters: This chaotic restructuring threatens to dismantle the V.A.\u2019s telehealth system, pushing veterans away from treatment and worsening an already dire mental health crisis. With clinicians warning of mass resignations and longer wait times, veterans may be left without critical care.Source: The New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUsha Vance to Visit Greenland as Trump Revives Talk of U.S. TakeoverWhat Happened: Second lady Usha Vance is set to visit Greenland this week, accompanied by a U.S. delegation, including National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. The trip comes as Trump again suggests the U.S. should seize Greenland, despite firm opposition from Denmark and Greenland\u2019s government.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed push for Greenland mirrors Putin\u2019s imperial ambitions\u2014ignoring sovereignty, straining U.S.-Denmark relations, and fueling backlash. Greenlanders have made it clear: they won\u2019t be bought or annexed.Source: Associated PressGreenland\u2019s Prime Minister Assails \u2018Aggressive\u2019 Trip Planned by U.S. OfficialsWhat Happened: Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute B. Egede blasted Trump\u2019s decision to send a delegation, calling it \u201chighly aggressive.\u201d Usha Vance and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are set to visit the island this week, with Waltz\u2019s presence sparking outrage. Trump has repeatedly vowed to take control of Greenland \u201cone way or the other.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed push for Greenland mirrors Putin\u2019s imperial ambitions\u2014ignoring sovereignty, straining U.S.-Denmark relations, and fueling backlash. Greenlanders have made it clear: they won\u2019t be bought or annexed.Source: The New York TimesTrump\u2019s Unpredictability Pushes Allies to Rethink U.S. Weapons DependenceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s foreign policy shifts\u2014including fealty to Russia, threats to NATO allies, and pausing intelligence-sharing with Ukraine\u2014have alarmed European partners, prompting them to reassess their reliance on American weapons. Concerns over U.S. control of advanced systems, potential cutoffs, and Trump's open threats against allies like Canada and Denmark are driving efforts to boost domestic defense industries.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic policies, betrayal of allies, and hostile rhetoric are pushing longtime allies toward defense independence\u2014and will weaken U.S. defense industry dominance and NATO cohesion in the long run.Source: The Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump\u2019s Envoy Echoes Kremlin Propaganda, Praises Putin Ahead of \u2018Peace Talks\u2019What Happened: Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, echoed Kremlin propaganda on Kremlin propagandist Tucker Carlson\u2019s show, claiming Ukrainians in occupied territories \u201cwant to be under Russian rule\u201d and suggesting the world should accept Russia\u2019s land grabs. He bragged about meetings with Putin, who commissioned a Trump portrait and \"prayed\" for him after his shooting.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s regime is packed with Kremlin assets eager to do Moscow\u2019s bidding. Witkoff is openly pushing Russian war propaganda, legitimizing a war criminal with an active arrest warrant, and attempting to force Ukraine to surrender. Trump and his cronies are undermining Ukraine, sidelining U.S. allies, and giving Russia a green light for future attacks on Ukraine and the rest of Europe.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Regulatory Freeze Wreaks Havoc on U.S. Fishing IndustryWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 60-day regulatory freeze has disrupted NOAA\u2019s ability to set fishing quotas and open seasons, delaying key decisions for East Coast fleets and leading to overfishing of Atlantic bluefin tuna. With NOAA\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service sidelined, fishermen face confusion, fleet delays, and possible quota reductions later in the season.Why It Matters: The freeze threatens the sustainability of a $320 billion industry, jeopardizing livelihoods and marine ecosystems. Trump\u2019s reckless regulatory halts are destabilizing industries that rely on science-based oversight.Source: ReutersSome European officials weigh if they can rely on Fed for dollars under TrumpWhat Happened: European central banking and regulatory officials are increasingly concerned about whether they can still rely on the U.S. Federal Reserve for dollar liquidity during financial crises. While the Fed has given no indication it would withhold funding, Trump\u2019s policies\u2014such as endorsing Russia\u2019s stance on Ukraine, imposing tariffs on allies, and undermining global stability\u2014have shaken trust in U.S. commitments.Why It Matters: The mere discussion of alternatives to the Fed\u2019s dollar backstops signals deepening transatlantic uncertainty. If European officials begin exploring independent mechanisms, it would weaken the U.S. financial system\u2019s global dominance and accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on the dollar.Source: ReutersUS tourism industry faces drop-off as immigration agenda deters travelersWhat Happened: The US tourism industry is taking a major hit as Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration policies lead to widespread fear among international travelers. Reports of tourists from allied nations\u2014including Germany, the UK, and Canada\u2014being detained, shackled, and held in poor conditions have caused a surge in travel warnings. Several governments, including Germany and the UK, have updated their travel advisories to caution citizens about the risk of arrest.Why It Matters: Forecasts predict a $64 billion shortfall in US tourism as travelers avoid the country due to the risk of detention. Canadian travel to the US has plummeted, while European nations are advising travelers and visa holders to reconsider visits. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance is not just isolating America diplomatically\u2014it\u2019s crippling a key economic sector.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News\u2018We the People\u2019 March in Louisville Protests Trump PoliciesWhat Happened: Nearly 500 protesters in Louisville\u2019s Highlands marched against Trump\u2019s policies, advocating for the preservation of constitutional rights.

so they are basically trying blackmail and bribery with terror tactics to get legally appointed officials to look the other way. None of that is legal and the courts must eventually prevail even if it takes months. </span></p><p><span>It has turned the USA into a corrupt parish state with which nobody will want to trade. If the courts do not take back the control given to them in the constitution, it will be decades before the rest of the free world can start to respect you again. How can you have possibly let this collapse happen so quickly? Elected representatives appear to have forgotten their responsibility to serve the people. </span></p><p><span>Get rich quick at the expense of your friends, has never before been the main driving American foreign policy as a nation. Previously that was confined to a few unscrupulous individuals. To me now, it appears that Putin has taken control of the USA to defeat his former enemy from within. American voters have been tricked with misleading catch phrases by a man who cannot even speak his own language in full sentences, let alone understand how taxes work.</span></p><div

Contracts span military logistics, broadband expansion, NASA missions, and missile defense. SpaceX has also gained access to federal launch sites and secured spectrum rights over objections from competitors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s grip on the government, while holding lucrative federal contracts, presents an unparalleled conflict of interest\\u2014giving him the power to rewrite policy for his profit. Corruption faces no meaningful checks with oversight agencies dismantled and ethics watchdogs silenced.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/spacex-contracts-musk-doge-trump.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Turns White House Easter Event Into Corporate Showcase</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The White House is offering corporate sponsorships for its Easter Egg Roll, allowing companies to pay up to $200,000 for branding, exclusive perks, and private White House access. This violates federal rules prohibiting the use of public office for private gain and is part of a broader pattern of Trump monetizing the presidency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Easter event is another avenue for Trump\\u2019s corruption, granting corporate donors influence in exchange for cash. The follows similar controversies, including Tesla\\u2019s exclusive White House car show and Trump\\u2019s personal cryptocurrency promotion.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/us/politics/trump-easter-egg-roll-sponsors.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Pentagon changed course for Musk visit after report about him viewing China war plans: Officials</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk was supposed to meet with the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon but was instead shuffled into a private meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after <em>The New York Times</em> exposed plans to brief him on secret China plans. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s unchecked access to national security discussions raises major red flags\\u2014especially as billions pour in from China to Musk companies. This is exactly why a free press is crucial\\u2014to expose backroom deals and hold power accountable.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-denies-musk-briefed-china-war-plans/story?id=120024341\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Rewards Key Allies Who Helped Him Take Back the White House</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has swiftly rewarded groups that backed his return to power, delivering major policy wins for Bitcoin advocates, labor unions, and Native American tribes. He ordered the Federal Reserve to hold Bitcoin, backed full federal recognition for North Carolina\\u2019s Lumbee Tribe, and appointed a union-friendly Labor Secretary after Teamsters President Sean O\\u2019Brien withheld endorsement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is buying loyalty from unlikely allies, but his deals come with ethical baggage\\u2014especially in crypto. If he fails to deliver, these groups could turn on him just as quickly.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/politics/trump-campaign-pledges-rewards/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump and Musk Intensify Efforts in Wisconsin Supreme Court Race</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump endorsed conservative candidate Brad Schimel in Wisconsin\\u2019s Supreme Court race, warning that a liberal win would derail his movement. Musk\\u2019s PAC has poured $13 million into the race and is offering Wisconsin voters $100 for their contact details and petition signatures\\u2014building a direct contact list to mobilize Trump supporters before the April 1 election.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The court\\u2019s balance could determine the future of abortion rights in Wisconsin and redistricting that currently favors Republicans. The unprecedented spending and data-driven voter outreach highlight how Trump and Musk are reshaping political influence tactics.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/23/musk-trump-wisconsin-supreme-court/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump finds new target in crusade against judges: Nationwide injunctions</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is demanding Congress and the Supreme Court strip federal judges of their ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have blocked key parts of his extremist and illegal agenda\\u2014including mass deportations, the military transgender ban, and the firing of federal workers. Stephen Miller, argues courts should have no authority over executive actions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct assault on the judiciary\\u2019s ability to check executive overreach. If successful, it would gut judicial oversight, giving Trump unchecked dictatorial power to impose policies without legal restraint. Judges are one of the last obstacles to full authoritarian control.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-injunction-nationwide-judges/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Pushes for Judiciary Purge, Signals Long Fight to Expand Power</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is escalating attacks on the judiciary, calling for the impeachment of a Washington judge overseeing a lawsuit against his mass deportation policies. His regime is also pushing to limit courts\\u2019 ability to issue nationwide injunctions, which have repeatedly blocked his agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is attempting to dismantle judicial checks on his power, punishing judges who rule against him, and working to strip courts of their authority. This highlights a broader push\\u2014one where legal challenges to his policies become nearly impossible.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-23/emboldened-trump-signals-long-court-fight-to-expand-power?embedded-checkout=true\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump instructs DOJ to sanction law firms over \\u2018vexatious\\u2019 litigation against government</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump directed the DOJ to punish law firms for \\\\\\\"vexatious\\\\\\\" lawsuits against the government, specifically targeting immigration lawyers. He also ordered a review of firms that have litigated against his regime over the past eight years.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the legal system to <strong>intimidate and silence</strong> firms litigating against his regime. His crackdown could deter legitimate legal challenges, eroding judicial independence and due process. This is an authoritarian attack on the legal profession, setting a dangerous precedent where lawyers fear retaliation for upholding the law.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5208866-donald-trump-justice-department-law-firms-government-litigation/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Orders Full Data Access for Designated Officials, Expanding DOGE\\u2019s Reach</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order granting any officials designated by the president or agency heads full access to all unclassified federal records, IT systems, and data\\u2014including third-party databases linked to federally funded state programs. Agencies must eliminate any internal rules restricting data sharing within 30 days.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This gives Trump\\u2019s hand-picked operatives, including those from Musk, sweeping access to sensitive government data, overriding agency policies designed to protect personal and institutional information. With prior reports of improper data sharing, this will lead to mass privacy violations and political abuse of federal records.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://fedscoop.com/trump-executive-order-data-sharing-information-silos/\\\\\\\">FedScoop</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>IRS Nears Data-Sharing Deal With ICE to Target Undocumented Immigrants</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The IRS is close to finalizing an agreement allowing ICE to access confidential taxpayer data to aid in deportations. The deal would let ICE cross-check the names and addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants against IRS databases. Career officials at the IRS have raised alarms, citing legal and ethical concerns over using tax information for immigration enforcement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the IRS to aid mass deportations, shredding taxpayer confidentiality, and expanding government overreach. Today, it\\u2019s being used against immigrants\\u2014tomorrow, it could be used against citizens.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/irs-close-finalizing-data-sharing-agreement-ice-sources/story?id=120063278\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Pam Bondi warns Jasmine Crockett to \\u2018tread very carefully\\u2019 in what she says about Elon Musk</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Attorney General Pam Bondi warned Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) to \\\\\\\"tread very carefully\\\\\\\" after she supported nationwide protests against Musk. Bondi also vowed to prosecute demonstrators, labeling Tesla-related vandalism as \\\\\\\"domestic terrorism,\\\\\\\" while the DOJ pursues charges against protesters.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Bondi\\u2019s threats signal a dangerous escalation\\u2014weaponizing the DOJ to intimidate critics and suppress dissent. The Trump regime is using law enforcement to shield Musk from public backlash, threatening to rein in protests while letting real threats go unchecked. This is authoritarianism in action.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/23/bondi-jasmine-crockett-musk-tesla-protests-00244256\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Thousands of Agents Diverted to Trump\\u2019s Immigration Crackdown</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s regime has reassigned thousands of federal agents from crime-fighting to immigration enforcement, pulling resources from investigating child exploitation, drug cartels, and financial crimes.
