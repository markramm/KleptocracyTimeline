The firm, mostly owned by the Trump family, has made over $550 million as Trump rolls back regulations and promotes crypto-friendly policies that benefit his own business.Why It Matters: Trump has dissolved the boundary between presidential authority and personal gain\u2014opening a direct path for foreign powers and wealthy insiders to purchase influence and policy, and transforming the presidency into a vehicle for private enrichment.Source: New York TimesTether Was Accused of Fraud. Now It\u2019s a Crypto Darling in WashingtonWhat Happened: Tether, once targeted by regulators for fraud, is now gaining influence in Washington thanks to Trump\u2019s crypto policies. CEO Paolo Ardoino is lobbying lawmakers, attending D.C. events, and partnering with Trump allies like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to shape favorable regulations.Why It Matters: Tether\u2019s rise highlights how Trump\u2019s crypto policy is enabling once-shunned firms to gain power, dodge oversight, and exploit loopholes in U.S. financial law\u2014with help from top officials.Source: New York TimesDon Bacon Sets $500 Billion Red Line on MedicaidWhat Happened: Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told the White House he won\u2019t support more than $500 billion in Medicaid cuts as Republicans negotiate a sweeping megabill that includes Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut extensions, work requirements, and benefit cuts.Why It Matters: With GOP leaders aiming to slash Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, even moderates like Bacon setting a $500 billion cap shows how deep the proposed cuts are.Source: PoliticoA DOGE Aide Involved in Dismantling Consumer Bureau Owns Stock in Companies That Could Benefit From the CutsWhat Happened: Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old Musk operative, helped oversee mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau while holding up to $365,000 in stock in companies the CFPB regulates\u2014likely violating federal ethics laws. Why It Matters: This is a blatant conflict of interest as Trump dismantles oversight. Trump and Musk are tearing down consumer protections while Musk unvetted operatives like Kliger cash in\u2014fueling corruption, cronyism, and unchecked corporate power.Source: ProPublicaFacing Corruption Allegations, Albanian Opposition Leader Hires Trump-Linked Lobbying TeamWhat Happened: Albania\u2019s indicted opposition leader, Sali Berisha, is attempting to overturn his U.S. sanctions by hiring Continental Strategy, a $6 million lobbying team stacked with Trump insiders.

Mark Milley; international students; elite universities; law firms; and media outlets like NPR and the AP.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s retribution campaign is an unprecedented abuse of presidential power\u2014punishing critics, investigators, and dissenters.

It also guts the FTC\u2019s antitrust authority, handing it to the DOJ\u2014an idea pushed by Musk.Why It Matters: The bill pretends to restore congressional oversight but hands Trump unchecked power to erase federal regulations. By using reconciliation to avoid Senate debate, it enables a quiet destruction of protections for the environment, consumers, and workers.Source: PoliticoTrump\u2019s Attack on ActBlue\u2019s \u201cDark Money\u201d Was Backed by Dark MoneyWhat Happened: Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for \u201cdonor fraud\u201d\u2014a sham based on lies from the Fair Election Fund, a group secretly bankrolled by Musk through dark money networks.Why It Matters: This is a classic authoritarian tactic\u2014using the government to punish and silence political opponents while shielding allies.

The order\u2019s vague language has sparked fears of politicized enforcement and legal risk, as Trump dismantles election security safeguards and imposes ideological litmus tests.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing grant money to push his extremist agenda and weaken election defenses, forcing states to choose between critical cybersecurity resources and compliance with politicized mandates.Source: The Washington PostEx-agents question role of Trump\u2019s DEA pick in violent overseas incidentsWhat Happened: Terrance Cole, Trump\u2019s nominee to head the DEA, is facing scrutiny over his role in two deadly operations abroad.

In 2011, DEA intel linked to Cole\u2019s team was leaked in Mexico, triggering cartel violence and the massacre of up to 300 civilians. Former DEA officials say Cole was involved in both incidents, though internal reports, kept classified, reportedly absolve him of blame.Why It Matters: Cole\u2019s nomination raises grave concerns about accountability and oversight. Tapping a DEA chief linked to deadly operations abroad, without full transparency, is reckless and dangerous.Source: CNNUSPS law enforcement assists Trump \u2018mass deportation\u2019 effort, sources and records showWhat Happened: The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has joined a Department of Homeland Security task force targeting undocumented immigrants, supplying ICE with surveillance data \u2014 including mail covers, USPS account activity, package tracking, and IP logs \u2014 to aid in locating people for detention and deportation.Why It Matters: This marks a major escalation in Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda, weaponizing the postal system as a surveillance tool.

Families received no notice, legal access was denied, and some victims were missing for over a month\u2014prompting human rights groups to label these enforced disappearances under international law.Why It Matters: Family members say the disappearances echo tactics of Latin American dictatorships, as Trump\u2019s DHS uses vague gang labels to justify secret detentions and disappearances.

The International Organization for Migration also lost 30% of its funding, forcing program shutdowns and leaving thousands without support.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s retreat from global humanitarian leadership is triggering the largest UN aid reductions in decades, threatening food, water, and medical aid for millions\u2014especially in war-torn regions like Yemen, Sudan, and Afghanistan.Source: Associated PressTrump aims to 'unleash' local police, but cautions against standing in the way of ICEWhat Happened: Trump signed two executive orders\u2014one to \u201cunleash\u201d local police with expanded federal backing, and another to punish states and cities that obstruct federal immigration enforcement. Why It Matters: These orders escalate Trump\u2019s crackdown on \u201csanctuary\u201d cities and empower the federal government to bully and prosecute local officials who don\u2019t comply with ICE.

secret multimillion-dollar payments from foreign firms while shaping U.S. policy to boost its value. The firm, mostly owned by the Trump family, has made over $550 million as Trump rolls back regulations and promotes crypto-friendly policies that benefit his own business.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has dissolved the boundary between presidential authority and personal gain\\u2014opening a direct path for foreign powers and wealthy insiders to purchase influence and policy, and transforming the presidency into a vehicle for private enrichment.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Tether Was Accused of Fraud.

A shadowy New Jersey group, \\u201CMake Albania Great Again Foundation,\\u201D is funding the effort.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The case reveals how corrupt foreign actors are exploiting dark money and personal connections to gain access in Trump\\u2019s Washington, aiming to use Marco Rubio and Susie Wiles to try to lift sanctions and rewrite U.S. foreign policy in their favor.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/sali-berisha-chris-lacivita-katie-wiles/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump's First 100 Days: $220 Billion Spending Surge Despite Cost-Cutting Promises</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump spent $2.19 trillion in his first 100 days\\u2014about $220 billion more than the same period last year\\u2014despite vows of deep budget cuts, mass purges, and dismantling of agencies led by Musk.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk, without evidence, claims $160 billion in \\u201Csavings,\\u201D but spending is higher than in 9 of the last 10 years, and the Republican tax bill will make it worse.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-promised-cuts-spent-200-billion-more/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>GOP Rep.

David Valadao (R-Calif.), who represents the highest share of Medicaid recipients in the GOP, cautioned House Republicans against pushing steep Medicaid cuts to fund tax breaks and border spending, warning such proposals could backfire politically and fail in the Senate.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Valadao\\u2019s comments reflect that the GOP is preparing to slash Medicaid and food aid, which will devastate millions. Yet the majority of Republicans remain willing to inflict this harm to deliver tax breaks for the wealthy.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/29/congress/its-a-dangerous-situation-gop-rep-with-most-medicaid-constituents-sends-a-warning-00316761\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump has used government powers to target more than 100 perceived enemies</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has weaponized the federal government to punish over 100 perceived enemies\\u2014ordering ICE detentions, criminal probes, contract cancellations, and revoked clearances. Targets include political foes like Liz Cheney, Letitia James, and Dr. Fauci; Jan. 6 prosecutors; Gen. Mark Milley; international students; elite universities; law firms; and media outlets like NPR and the AP.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s retribution campaign is an unprecedented abuse of presidential power\\u2014punishing critics, investigators, and dissenters. His actions erode civil liberties and replace the rule of law with authoritarian vengeance.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/29/nx-s1-5327518/donald-trump-100-days-retribution-threats\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>It was supposed to be a tax and border bill.

It also guts the FTC\\u2019s antitrust authority, handing it to the DOJ\\u2014an idea pushed by Musk.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The bill pretends to restore congressional oversight but hands Trump unchecked power to erase federal regulations. By using reconciliation to avoid Senate debate, it enables a quiet destruction of protections for the environment, consumers, and workers.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/29/trump-executive-powers-reins-act-ftc-antitrust-00317105\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s Attack on ActBlue\\u2019s \\u201CDark Money\\u201D Was Backed by Dark Money</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue for \\u201Cdonor fraud\\u201D\\u2014a sham based on lies from the Fair Election Fund, a group secretly bankrolled by Musk through dark money networks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a classic authoritarian tactic\\u2014using the government to punish and silence political opponents while shielding allies. The case against ActBlue hinges on unverified claims, anonymous sources, and deceptive tactics, highlighting Trump\\u2019s escalating abuse of federal power for partisan gain.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trumps-attack-on-actblues-dark-money-was-backed-by-dark-money/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Federal Watchdog Reveals Dozens of Inquiries Into Trump\\u2019s Withholding of Funds</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Government Accountability Office has launched 39 investigations into whether Trump illegally blocked or delayed more than $430 billion in congressionally approved funds during his first 100 days, targeting programs in education, health, transportation, and foreign aid.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s spending freeze is pushing the U.S. toward a constitutional crisis, as he tries to override Congress\\u2019s control of federal funds. The move destabilizes vital programs and revives the same abuse of power that led to his first impeachment over Ukraine aid.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/trump-funds-gao.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump, Echoing Project 2025, Using 'Flood the Zone' Strategy to Push Agenda: Experts</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump issued more than 140 executive orders in his first 100 days as part of a deliberate \\u201Cflood the zone\\u201D strategy aimed at dismantling regulatory agencies, overwhelming oversight systems, and rapidly reshaping the federal government to fit the authoritarian blueprint laid out in Project 2025.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s flood of executive actions and purges will inflict lasting damage on the U.S. constitutional system. Even if courts intervene, the strategy is to destabilize oversight, entrench far-right ideology, and push irreversible changes before resistance can take hold.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-echoing-project-2025-flood-zone-strategy-push/story?id=121124118\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>New Lawsuit Argues Trump and DOGE\\u2019s Government Overhaul Is Unconstitutional</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A coalition of unions, local governments, and nonprofits filed suit Monday to block Trump\\u2019s federal workforce purges, arguing that his executive order\\u2014and the actions directed by Musk\\u2019s unauthorized FAKE DOGE\\u2014illegally override Congress\\u2019s constitutional power to create and fund federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is the broadest legal challenge yet to Trump\\u2019s purge of the federal workforce. Plaintiffs argue the cuts were unconstitutional, bypassing Congress to install unaccountable Musk operatives and weaponize executive power.

The order\\u2019s vague language has sparked fears of politicized enforcement and legal risk, as Trump dismantles election security safeguards and imposes ideological litmus tests.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing grant money to push his extremist agenda and weaken election defenses, forcing states to choose between critical cybersecurity resources and compliance with politicized mandates.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/29/trump-dei-election-security-states/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Ex-agents question role of Trump\\u2019s DEA pick in violent overseas incidents</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Terrance Cole, Trump\\u2019s nominee to head the DEA, is facing scrutiny over his role in two deadly operations abroad.

In 2011, DEA intel linked to Cole\\u2019s team was leaked in Mexico, triggering cartel violence and the massacre of up to 300 civilians. Former DEA officials say Cole was involved in both incidents, though internal reports, kept classified, reportedly absolve him of blame.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Cole\\u2019s nomination raises grave concerns about accountability and oversight.

Others dismissed include Ron Klain and Susan Rice, central architects of the 2023 National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Emhoff criticized the move as a politicization of Holocaust remembrance, calling it dangerous and disrespectful.
