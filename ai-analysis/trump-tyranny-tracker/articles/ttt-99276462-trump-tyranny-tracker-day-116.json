Public Corruption Squad Targeting Federal OfficialsWhat Happened: The FBI is shutting down a key public corruption squad in its Washington field office that investigated fraud by members of Congress and federal officials, part of a broader dismantling under Director Kash Patel.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader war on accountability. His regime is dismantling anti-corruption efforts\u2014gutting DOJ units, freezing foreign bribery cases, and shifting FBI resources away from white-collar crime. This opens the door for political allies and powerful elites to act with impunity.Source: Associated PressTrump Leaned on African Countries. The Goal: Get Business for Elon Musk.What Happened: Trump officials pressured African governments, especially Gambia, to approve deals for Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, using U.S. aid as leverage. Diplomats worked hand-in-hand with Musk\u2019s company to push approvals.Why It Matters: It\u2019s crony capitalism in action\u2014Trump\u2019s foreign policy used to enrich Musk. It sets a dangerous precedent, turning U.S. diplomacy into a tool for personal gain.Source: ProPublica\u2018An Ethics Nightmare\u2019: Trump\u2019s Memecoin Dinner to Draw Crypto High RollersWhat Happened: Trump is hosting a May 22 gala for the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP memecoin, with VIP access granted to the top 25. The coin surged after the invite, attracting MAGA fans, crypto speculators\u2014and foreign investors.Why It Matters: Trump is selling access to the presidency through a crypto scheme tied to foreign money. More corruption, lawlessness, and a potential violation of federal rules and the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauseSource: Wall Street JournalUS set to cut capital requirements for banksWhat Happened: U.S. regulators are preparing to cut the supplementary leverage ratio, a key rule requiring large banks to hold extra loss-absorbing capital. The move would ease requirements on holdings like U.S. Treasuries.Why It Matters: These key protections were put in place after the 2008 crash.

It mimics the authoritarian pageantry of Russia and North Korea while openly selling access and influence to wealthy donors.Source: Wall Street JournalHomeland Security looks to buy a new $50M jet for secretary and Coast Guard officialsWhat Happened: DHS requested $50 million from the Coast Guard\u2019s 2025 budget to buy a new Gulfstream jet for Kristi Noem and top officials, despite already having a similar aircraft.Why It Matters: Critics call it wasteful spending and a luxury perk for Trump allies, especially as Coast Guard resources remain stretched and Trump eyes a private jet bribe from Qatar.Source: Associated PressDonald Trump Jr.'s transformation into Washington power brokerWhat Happened: Donald Trump Jr. has rapidly transformed into a central figure in Washington, joining at least eight corporate boards and launching a $500,000-membership D.C. club called \u201cExecutive Branch,\u201d frequented by Trump regime insiders. He\u2019s also a key player in Trump-aligned crypto, drone, and healthcare ventures.Why It Matters: Trump Jr.\u2019s rise as MAGA power broker and corporate dealmaker reiterates Trump\u2019s merger of politics and profit. It\u2019s a textbook case of pay-to-play\u2014where influence is for sale and self-enrichment drives policy.Source: CBS NewsSerbia\u2019s Embattled Leader Looks to Leverage Trump Family TiesWhat Happened: Serbia\u2019s President Aleksandar Vucic is courting Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014including Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr.\u2014to shore up his regime. At the center: a $500 million Trump-Kushner hotel project on a former NATO bombing site in Belgrade. Trump ally Richard Grenell has been honored by Vucic, and Don Jr. has made multiple trips to pursue deals.Why It Matters: It\u2019s influence-peddling in plain sight. Vucic is trading state-backed projects for Trumpworld loyalty\u2014blurring the line between foreign policy and personal profit. It reflects a broader authoritarian playbook: reward the Trump family to secure protection, favor, and power.Source: BloombergTrump-Kushner Serbia Hotel Project Stalls After Forgery ScandalWhat Happened: A top Serbian official admitted to forging a government document that allowed a bombed-out defense complex in Belgrade to be demolished for a $500 million Trump-Kushner luxury hotel project. The fake document stripped the site of protected status, clearing the way for the controversial real estate deal backed by Trump\u2019s family.Why It Matters: Foreign governments are rewriting laws and faking records to funnel cash and assets to the Trump family in exchange for influence. This isn\u2019t just corruption\u2014it\u2019s international bribery in plain sight.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsStephen Miller re-emerges as an \u2018untouchable\u2019 force in Trump\u2019s White HouseWhat Happened: Stephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Adviser, has emerged as the most powerful unelected figure in Trump\u2019s second term, authoring sweeping executive orders and driving extreme and, in some cases, unlawful policies on immigration, civil rights, and national security. Viewed by Trump as his ideological enforcer, Miller is shaping domestic and foreign agendas from behind closed doors.Why It Matters: Miller, like Trump, is running an authoritarian agenda from inside the White House. With no public mandate, he\u2019s driving extremist and unconstitutional policies like ending birthright citizenship and suspending habeas corpus, while dismantling civil rights protections. Even cabinet members fall in line behind him.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Military Buildup at the Border ExpandsWhat Happened: Trump has deployed more than 8,600 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014up from 2,500 under Biden\u2014alongside armored vehicles, U-2 spy planes, drones, helicopters, and even Navy warships. The Pentagon has created military-controlled zones along the border, where migrants can be detained for trespassing.Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented militarization of the southern border\u2014turning immigration enforcement into a long-term combat mission, despite arrests being down. This blurs the line between national defense and domestic policing\u2014 and is normalizing military deployment on U.S. soil.Source: New York TimesLaw Firms Fighting Back Against Trump Report Security Clearance SuspensionsWhat Happened: The law firms WilmerHale and Jenner & Block told federal courts this week that Trump revoked security clearances for several of their attorneys, despite a judge\u2019s temporary block on the move. The revocations come amid Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting firms that refused to align with his legal agenda.Why It Matters: The clearance suspensions cripple the firms\u2019 ability to represent clients in national security cases and are political retaliation. It\u2019s an authoritarian attack on the independence of the legal profession, the rule of law, and the constitutional right to counsel\u2014and another example of Trump defying court orders.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDHS Requests 20,000 National Guard Troops for Domestic Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security has asked the Pentagon to deploy over 20,000 National Guard troops for domestic \"interior immigration enforcement\"\u2014a significant escalation from past border support roles. Pentagon lawyers are currently reviewing the legality of the request.Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented deployment of force on U.S. soil, blurring the line between defense and domestic policing. By shifting from border security to interior enforcement, Trump is laying the foundation for a mass domestic force\u2014fueling an authoritarian agenda that threatens civil liberties and expands unchecked federal power.Source: CBS NewsJames Comey Investigated Over Seashell Photo Republicans Call \u2018Threat\u2019 Against TrumpWhat Happened: Former FBI director James Comey posted an Instagram photo of seashells arranged as \u201c8647\u201d \u2014 interpreted by Trump allies as coded language for \u201ckill 47.\u201d Comey deleted the post and said he was unaware of the possible violent interpretation, insisting he opposes violence. The Secret Service confirmed it is investigating.Why It Matters: Trump officials, including Kristi Noem and Kash Patel, are weaponizing federal agencies to target political enemies\u2014while senior officials are calling for James Comey\u2019s arrest over a seashell photo with no legal basis. This reiterates their intent to criminalize dissent and use federal power for retribution.Source: The GuardianTrump Escalates Harvard Feud With New Justice Dept. InvestigationWhat Happened: Trump has launched a Justice Department investigation into Harvard\u2019s admissions under the False Claims Act, a law usually reserved for government contractor fraud. It accuses the university of potentially \u201cdefrauding\u201d the government by violating the Supreme Court\u2019s ban on affirmative action.Why It Matters: This is another political hit job. Trump is using obscure fraud laws to punish Harvard and intimidate other universities.

He accused federal prosecutors of attempting to \u201chumiliate and degrade\u201d him for political reasons.Why It Matters: Baraka says the charges are retaliation for defending immigrant rights\u2014and he\u2019s not alone. The case exposes how Trump\u2019s DOJ is using prosecution as a political weapon against local leaders who challenge his agenda.Source: Associated PressTrump Fires Hundreds of Voice of America EmployeesWhat Happened: Trump purged nearly 600 contractors\u2014more than a third of Voice of America\u2019s workforce. Most of those fired were journalists, including some whose U.S. immigration status was tied to their jobs. Simultaneously, the government put the network\u2019s D.C. headquarters up for sale.Why It Matters: This is a purge of independent journalists and a blatant power grab. Trump\u2019s team is gutting Voice of America and replacing real reporting with pro-Trump propaganda from outlets like OAN. State media in the making.Source: New York TimesTrump Presses Apple to Build iPhones in U.S., Wall Street ShrugsWhat Happened: Trump criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook for shifting iPhone assembly to India and pushed for full U.S.-based manufacturing. Trump claimed he told Cook, \u201cWe want you to build in the U.S., not India.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is using the presidency to strong-arm a private company into reshaping its global supply chain\u2014an authoritarian overreach into the free market. Apple isn\u2019t budging, and Wall Street isn\u2019t buying the pressure.Source: Wall Street JournalPrice tag for Trump\u2019s military festival could reach $45 millionWhat Happened: Trump is staging a massive military parade on June 14\u2014the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th anniversary and his birthday. The $25\u2013$45 million event will include tanks, warplanes, fireworks, and 6,600 troops, with thousands housed in federal buildings across D.C.Why It Matters: The spectacle mirrors authoritarian displays in Russia, North Korea, and China\u2014using military force for personal glorification. This is propaganda disguised as patriotism, especially as Trump slashes veterans\u2019 services. Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsMilitary commanders will be told to send transgender troops to medical checks to oust themWhat Happened: Under new Pentagon guidance, military commanders are instructed to identify transgender service members or those with gender dysphoria and send them for medical evaluations aimed at discharging them, following Trump\u2019s directive to purge transgender troops from the armed forces.Why It Matters: The policy forces troops to out themselves or face being kicked out. Critics say it\u2019s a targeted purge, using medical checks as a weapon to discriminate and push marginalized service members out of the military.Source: Associated PressRed States Join Trump\u2019s War on DEI as \u201cAnti-Woke\u201d Legislation SpreadsWhat Happened: Republican-led states are accelerating efforts to dismantle DEI programs, echoing Trump\u2019s federal crackdown. West Virginia, Arkansas, and Indiana are among 9 states enacting laws to ban DEI in state agencies, with 25 states pushing over 100 anti-DEI bills in 2025.Why It Matters: Backed by Trump loyalists like Stephen Miller and Russell Vought, the anti-DEI crusade aims to dismantle civil rights protections under the guise of \u201cequality.\u201d It\u2019s a political assault that hijacks identity politics to erase decades of anti-discrimination progress.Source: USA TodayHow Trump Is Weakening the Enforcement of Fair Housing LawsWhat Happened: Trump has effectively gutted the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Fair Housing Office. Over 115 civil rights cases have been closed or stalled, a third of the office's staff are being purged, and key protections for LGBTQ+ people, non-English speakers, and disabled tenants are no longer being enforced.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on civil rights enforcement. By gutting HUD\u2019s fair housing work, Trump is giving a green light to discrimination\u2014especially against the LGBTQ+ community, disabled, and minority renters. With no charges filed and settlements collapsing, justice is vanishing.

Doctors are keeping her on life support to sustain her 21-week pregnancy, citing Georgia\u2019s strict six-week abortion ban, which prohibits terminating pregnancies after fetal cardiac activity is detected.Why It Matters: Smith is legally dead, but Georgia law prevents doctors from removing life support. Her family says the fetus has health complications, and they are unable to make end-of-life decisions. The case underscores the harsh human impact of post-Roe abortion bans.Source: The GuardianDHS Weighs Reality Show Where Immigrants Compete for CitizenshipWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing a reality TV proposal where immigrants would compete in challenges like U.S. history or science for a shot at citizenship. The show is pitched by Duck Dynasty producer Rob Worsoff and is in early vetting stages.Why It Matters: The show would turn immigration into a ridiculous spectacle, trivializing a life-altering process for entertainment. Though DHS claims no one would be deported for losing, the proposal, now gaining traction under Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem, raises serious ethical red flags. Source: Wall Street JournalSupreme Court Weighs Trump\u2019s Bid to Restrict Birthright CitizenshipWhat Happened: The Supreme Court heard arguments on Trump\u2019s executive order denying citizenship to U.S.-born children of non-citizen or non\u2013green card\u2013holding parents. Trump seeks to lift nationwide injunctions blocking the policy, without a full ruling on its legality.Why It Matters: If upheld, the order could strip citizenship from over 150,000 newborns annually and reverse over a century of constitutional precedent under the 14th Amendment. The case also threatens to limit the power of lower courts to block unconstitutional policies nationwide.Source: ReutersHarvard Scientist Kseniia Petrova to Be Transferred to Massachusetts on Smuggling ChargeWhat Happened: Kseniia Petrova, a Russian researcher at Harvard Medical School, is being transferred from a Louisiana jail to Massachusetts after being charged with felony \u201csmuggling\u201d for bringing non-living lab samples from Paris. The charge came just hours after she filed a lawsuit against Trump over her three-month detention.Why It Matters: The charge came after Trump tried to deport her to Russia for opposing Putin. This is retaliation\u2014and it feels like the Kremlin is dictating this. If convicted, Petrova could get 20 years.Source: USA Today\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFEMA to Shift More Disaster Recovery to States Ahead of Hurricane SeasonWhat Happened: FEMA\u2019s acting chief, David Richardson, announced the agency will shift more disaster response responsibilities to state governments for the 2025 hurricane season.Why It Matters: With major storms looming and Trump threatening to eliminate FEMA, critics warn the U.S. could be abandoning disaster response just as climate risks intensify\u2014leaving vulnerable communities exposed and unprotected.Source: Associated PressFAA Using eBay and 3D Printers for Parts as Aging Systems Strain SafetyWhat Happened: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Congress that the FAA has resorted to buying parts on eBay and using 3D printers to maintain outdated air traffic systems, some over 40 years old. The agency faces major staffing shortages and equipment failures amid a Trump-backed push to privatize and overhaul air control.Why It Matters: The revelations expose a fragile aviation system under strain. Trump\u2019s purges of air traffic controllers and short-term infrastructure fixes are putting public safety in serious danger.Source: CBS NewsAir Traffic Controller Averts Midair Collision, Speaks Out on FAA CrisisWhat Happened: Jonathan Stewart, an air traffic controller overseeing Newark airspace, averted a midair collision and is now speaking out. He\u2019s taken trauma leave, citing unsafe conditions, outdated FAA systems, and understaffing as mounting risks to public safety.Why It Matters: Stewart\u2019s warnings expose deep cracks in the FAA\u2019s infrastructure and workforce. As flight disruptions and tech failures escalate, his rare public testimony highlights the toll on controllers\u2019 mental health and rebuts airline execs blaming staff, pointing instead to systemic neglect.Source: Wall Street JournalFEMA Staffing Crisis and Low Morale Undermine Hurricane PreparednessWhat Happened: An internal FEMA document reveals that massive staff purges and morale issues have derailed disaster planning ahead of the June 1 hurricane season. One-third of FEMA's workforce\u2014around 2,000 employees\u2014has been purged.Why It Matters: With a severe hurricane season looming, Trump\u2019s push to downsize or eliminate FEMA has left the agency under-resourced and disorganized. This will leave states overwhelmed and put millions at risk during climate-fueled disasters.Source: ReutersDenver Air Traffic Lost Communications for Two Minutes MondayWhat Happened: On May 12, Denver\u2019s air traffic control briefly lost its main and backup radio frequencies for about two minutes. Controllers managed to re-establish contact via an emergency frequency, with no loss of aircraft separation. The FAA is investigating.Why It Matters: This comes after multiple outages in Newark. A GAO report found 51 of the FAA\u2019s 138 systems unsustainable, with full modernization not expected for a decade, despite calls for urgent action.Source: The GuardianNew N.I.H. Policy Threatens Global Science CollaborationsWhat Happened:  NIH has banned U.S. researchers from sending federal grant funds to foreign partners, citing tracking and oversight concerns. The move halts sub-awards to international collaborators and could shutter thousands of research projects.Why It Matters: This sweeping policy change threatens to derail global research partnerships, including vital breast cancer studies using unique Danish data and tissue samples. Scientists warn it will stall medical breakthroughs and harm U.S. patients by cutting off access to critical international resources.Source: New York TimesUS would assess nuclear waste, plutonium for reactor fuel under draft orderWhat Happened: A draft executive order would assess reprocessing nuclear waste and using plutonium as reactor fuel, reviving controversial Cold War-era practices. The plan also seeks to shift control of nuclear approvals from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the regime.Why It Matters: Experts warn the move increases nuclear proliferation risks, as reprocessing creates materials that could be used in weapons. Critics say it prioritizes energy dominance over safety, potentially making the U.S. and the world less secure.Source: ReutersOlder people in crosshairs as government restarts Social Security garnishment on student loansWhat Happened: Trump has restarted garnishing Social Security checks to collect on defaulted federal student loans, impacting over 450,000 older Americans, many of whom are already living below the poverty line or on fixed incomes.Why It Matters: Slashing student debt protections will push elderly Americans into crisis\u2014many now face skipped meals or homelessness over decades-old loans they\u2019ve often already repaid many times over. With the Education Department gutted, help is harder to find, and financial ruin will spread.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Targets Europe\u2019s Digital Laws as Threat to U.S. InterestsWhat Happened: Trump is escalating attacks on the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act, claiming it endangers free speech and \u201cunfairly burdens\u201d American tech companies. The State Department has launched a diplomatic campaign framing the law as a tool of censorship and warning that its content moderation standards could spill into U.S. platforms.Why It Matters: Trump officials are attacking EU digital rules meant to curb disinformation, claiming they threaten U.S. free speech, while ignoring operations from Russia and the threat it poses. It\u2019s a gift to Big Tech and a dangerous reversal: dismantling anti-propaganda efforts and turning on allies who are trying to protect online users.Source: Wall Street JournalGreenland Dangles Rare Earth Deal with EU Amid Trump ThreatsWhy It Matters: Greenland is leveraging its rare earths to align with the EU as Trump continues his threats to seize the island. The move signals Europe is moving to counter U.S. aggression with strategic partnerships.Why It Matters: Greenland holds key minerals essential to global tech and defense.

Border agents are empowered to search phones, deny entry, or detain visitors, especially those with pro-Palestinian views or minor visa infractions.Why It Matters: These policies are chilling dissent and deterring international travel. Immigration lawyers warn that ideological targeting and warrantless searches blur the line between security and repression.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPutin Delays Ceasefire by Snubbing Peace Talks With Zelensky, Says StarmerWhat Happened: U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized Putin for refusing to attend face-to-face talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey. Despite Ukraine\u2019s offer of an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting May 12, Putin declined and sent aide Medinsky in his place.Why It Matters: Starmer\u2019s accusation highlights Putin\u2019s strategy of weaponized delay\u2014pretending to negotiate while continuing to kill Ukrainians. It reiterates that Russia has no intention of ending its genocidal war and is using \u201cceasefire\u201d talks as a stalling tactic while Trump continues to provide cover for Putin.Source: The Kyiv IndependentA Christian Nationalist TheoBro Church Is Coming to DCWhat Happened: Pastor Doug Wilson, a leading figure in the Christian nationalist movement, is opening a new church in Washington, DC, just blocks from the Capitol. Wilson, known for extreme views on slavery, gender roles, and biblical law, says the church is a strategic effort to engage Trump-aligned evangelicals in the heart of U.S. power.Why It Matters: This is a major leap in the Christian nationalist drive to impose hardline theocratic rule. With allies like Speaker Mike Johnson, Russ Vought, JD Vance, Pete Hegseth, the movement now holds real power\u2014and a platform inside the federal government to entrench it.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsWalmart says it will hike some prices due to tariffsWhat Happened: Walmart announced it will raise prices on some items\u2014like bananas, avocados, roses, toys, and electronics\u2014due to steep Trump tariffs on imports from countries like China, Peru, and Vietnam. CFO John David Rainey said price increases will start in late May and ramp up in June.Why It Matters: As the U.S. imposes wide-reaching tariffs, even discount giants like Walmart can\u2019t shield consumers entirely. The hikes will hit groceries and back-to-school goods, strain household budgets, and reflect broader inflationary pressure from Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy.Source: CNBCJamie Dimon Warns Recession Still Possible Despite US\u2013China Tariff ReliefWhat Happened: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that a U.S. recession remains on the table, even after a new deal with China reduced tariffs. Under the agreement, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods dropped from 145% to 30%, while China lowered its tariffs on American imports to 10%.Why It Matters: While economists cut recession odds to below 50%, Dimon remains concerned about long-term economic volatility. He also questioned assumptions about America\u2019s enduring market dominance, warning, \u201cYou do not have a divine right to success.\u201dSource: CNNFed Chair Powell Warns of Higher Long-Term Rates Amid Supply ShocksWhat Happened: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates will likely remain higher over the long term due to ongoing supply shocks and economic volatility. Powell emphasized that the era of near-zero rates is over and that inflation may remain more volatile than in past decades.Why It Matters: With tariffs, geopolitical disruptions, and climate events fueling instability, Powell signaled the Fed may not ease rates soon\u2014despite pressure from Trump. Higher borrowing costs could persist, affecting everything from mortgages to business investment.Source: CNBCKid Rock\u2019s Restaurant Struggles as Undocumented Workers Flee Rumored ICE RaidsWhat Happened: Staff at Kid Rock\u2019s Big Ass Honky Tonk Steakhouse and other Nashville eateries owned by Trump donor Steve Smith were told to leave mid-shift if undocumented, triggering chaos during a busy weekend. The warning followed intensified ICE sweeps that led to nearly 200 arrests.Why It Matters: This exposes MAGA\u2019s hypocrisy\u2014relying on undocumented workers while championing anti-immigrant crackdowns and spewing propaganda.

The plan also seeks to shift control of nuclear approvals from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Experts warn the move increases nuclear proliferation risks, as reprocessing creates materials that could be used in weapons.

The State Department has launched a diplomatic campaign framing the law as a tool of censorship and warning that its content moderation standards could spill into U.S. platforms.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump officials are attacking EU digital rules meant to curb disinformation, claiming they threaten U.S. free speech, while ignoring operations from Russia and the threat it poses.
