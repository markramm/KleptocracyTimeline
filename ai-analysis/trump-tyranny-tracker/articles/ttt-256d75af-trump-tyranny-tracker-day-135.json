This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ize2tO9wo7BCGqa0AGeK82sK_6DFVny5TRM4SQiRAD8/editDon\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsElon Musk\u2019s Reign of Corruption Chronicled in Elizabeth Warren ReportWhat Happened: A new report from Sen. Elizabeth Warren details 130 acts of corruption by Elon Musk during his 130 days in Trump\u2019s government. It accuses him of using public power to enrich his companies, install loyalists, and dismantle oversight.Why It Matters: Musk ran the government like a cartel\u2014rewarding allies, crushing watchdogs, and cashing in. Warren calls it state-sponsored theft, not public service.Source: Rolling StoneSome Dems Warn Colleagues: Crypto Bill Could Inject Some 19th Century Chaos Into US EconomyWhat Happened: The GENIUS Act, backed by most Senate Republicans and a few Democrats, would give stablecoins legal standing under a light-touch regulatory regime. Critics say the bill could unleash a financial contagion by allowing banks and tech giants to issue digital currencies with minimal safeguards.Why It Matters: Experts and Democrats warn this bill revives 19th-century banking chaos\u2014private currencies, bank runs, and no federal protections. If adopted widely, stablecoins could make Big Tech financial giants too big to fail, risking systemic collapse in a crisis.Source: Talking Points MemoThe Tech Recruitment Ruse That Has Avoided Trump\u2019s Crackdown on ImmigrationWhat Happened: U.S. tech companies are exploiting the outdated PERM green card system to convert H-1B visa holders into permanent residents. Job ads required by law are often buried in obscure print classifieds and linked to fake offices, designed to ensure no qualified U.S. applicants are hired.Why It Matters: This loophole keeps a steady flow of cheaper foreign labor, even as American tech workers face layoffs. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has left this system untouched, benefiting allies like Oracle, Palantir, and Tesla while blocking reformSource: ProPublicaSome of Trump\u2019s Biggest Inaugural Donors Benefit From Early Government ActionsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 2025 inaugural committee raised a record-shattering $250 million\u2014twice the previous high. Major donors like Pilgrim\u2019s Pride and Ripple Labs quickly reaped rewards: Ripple settled a $2 billion SEC case for just $50 million and got a public Trump endorsement; JBS (Pilgrim\u2019s parent) won USDA approvals and a long-sought NYSE listing. Other donors were awarded ambassadorships, tariff carveouts, and elite access.Why It Matters: Trump is running a government-for-sale operation. From legal settlements to global market entries, the message is clear\u2014 write a big enough check, and policy will bend in your favor. Source: Wall Street JournalTrump-Tied \u2018Truth Social Bitcoin ETF\u2019 Edges Closer to LaunchWhat Happened: NYSE filed paperwork to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, backed by Yorkville America Digital and tied to Trump Media & Technology Group, which is majority-owned by Trump. The ETF would track Bitcoin prices, with Crypto.com serving as custodian.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s business is plunging deeper into crypto just as he writes the rules\u2014an open invitation for corruption. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would profit directly from Trump\u2019s political clout, collapsing the boundary between public office and private enrichment. An emboldened Trump isn\u2019t even bothering to hide it.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump seeks to reshape judiciary as first nominees face SenateWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new judicial nominees include loyalists who defended abortion bans, attacked transgender rights, and helped him personally. He\u2019s sidelining traditional conservative vetting groups like the Federalist Society in favor of MAGA-aligned picks.Why It Matters: Trump wants to reshape the courts to serve his lawless agenda, installing loyalists over legal experts. It\u2019s part of a power grab that threatens judicial independence.Source: ReutersTrump Moves to Fast-Track Federal Worker FiringsWhat Happened: Trump proposed a new rule letting the Office of Personnel Management fast-track the firing of federal employees, giving agencies just five days to act once OPM flags \u201cmisconduct,\u201d including leaks or refusal to testify.Why It Matters: This further guts civil service protections and paves the way for more mass, politically motivated purges. It\u2019s a key step in Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle a nonpartisan federal workforce and consolidate loyalty over competence.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsUSDA Halts Demand for Food Stamp Recipient Data Amid LawsuitWhat Happened: The USDA has paused its demand for states to turn over five years of sensitive SNAP recipient data\u2014including names, Social Security numbers, and citizenship status\u2014after a lawsuit argued it violated federal privacy laws.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s continued data grab, backed by Musk, could have exposed tens of millions of low-income Americans. Privacy advocates call it a dangerous overreach designed to punish the poor and immigrants under the guise of fraud prevention.Source: NPRTrump Guts DOJ Anti-Corruption Infrastructure, Paving Way for Political and Corporate AbuseWhat Happened: In just four months, Trump\u2019s DOJ has gutted key anti-corruption measures\u2014purging oversight units, halting foreign bribery enforcement, and pardoning nearly every convicted GOP lawmaker from the past 15 years. Prosecutors were pressured to drop major cases, including one against NYC Mayor Eric Adams.Why It Matters: Oversight has collapsed. Trump is using the DOJ to shield allies and punish enemies, turning law enforcement into a political weapon. This is institutionalized corruption\u2014and a direct assault on the rule of law.Source: NBC NewsJustice Department Drops Lawsuit Against Trump Adviser Peter NavarroWhat Happened: The DOJ quietly dropped its 2022 civil lawsuit against Peter Navarro, who was accused of using a private email for official business and withholding presidential records. Navarro recently completed a prison sentence related to Jan. 6 contempt charges.Why It Matters: The unexplained dismissal underscores Trump\u2019s pattern of selective enforcement\u2014protecting loyalists while dismantling oversight. It signals growing impunity and further erodes mechanisms for accountability and transparency in government.Source: Associated PressTrump Tyranny Tracker is a reader-supported publication.

His objective was clear.What Happened: Michael Ignatieff, former president of Central European University, warns that Trump is following Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s authoritarian playbook by targeting U.S. universities. Just as Orb\u00e1n forced CEU out of Hungary, Trump is using funding freezes, visa threats, and political interference to attack academic freedom.Why It Matters: This is about control. What began with universities in Hungary is now happening in America\u2014just as in Russia, where academic freedom was crushed to silence dissent and enforce loyalty. Trump\u2019s crackdown is a test run for broader authoritarian consolidation, where no institution is safe from political capture.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS Navy to rename oil tanker named after gay rights activist Harvey MilkWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of Navy ships named after civil rights icons\u2014including Harvey Milk, Thurgood Marshall, Harriet Tubman, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The move, revealed just days into Pride Month, is widely seen as a political rebuke of LGBTQ+ inclusion and broader diversity achievements in the military.Why It Matters: This is a calculated erasure of civil rights history from military honors, driven by Trump\u2019s agenda to dismantle DEI initiatives. Stripping Harvey Milk\u2019s name is about rewriting which Americans are deemed worthy of recognition.Source: New York TimesICE Detains Massachusetts Student Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, Sparks High School WalkoutsWhat Happened: ICE agents detained 18-year-old Milford High student Marcelo Gomes Da Silva on May 31 while he was driving to volleyball practice. Though not the intended target\u2014his father was\u2014Gomes was arrested as a \u201ccollateral\u201d immigrant despite having no criminal record and an active asylum claim.Why It Matters: The arrest ignited outrage across Massachusetts, prompting school walkouts and rallies. Trump\u2019s aggressive \u201cOperation Patriot\u201d tactics continue sweeping up students and non-criminal immigrants, creating fear in communities and schools.Source: USA TodayTrump Rescinds Biden-Era Guidance Requiring Emergency AbortionsWhat Happened: Trump revoked a 2022 Biden-era directive requiring hospitals to perform emergency abortions under the EMTALA law, even in states where abortion is banned. The original guidance mandated care in life-threatening pregnancy complications such as ectopic pregnancies or preeclampsia.Why It Matters: The reversal strips federal protection for emergency abortion care, giving anti-abortion states more power to deny lifesaving treatment. Women will die as hospitals reject care\u2014and Trump breaks yet another promise not to interfere with abortion access.Source: ABC NewsMillions of legal immigrants\u2019 lives upended after social security freezeWhat Happened: Trump quietly paused the \u201cEnumeration Beyond Entry\u201d program in March 2025, which allowed legal immigrants to automatically receive Social Security numbers with work authorization. Now, millions face delays starting jobs, getting licenses, or accessing basic services\u2014despite being legally authorized to work.Why It Matters: This is bureaucratic weaponization of immigration policy\u2014creating chaos, job losses, and confusion for legal immigrants. With downsized Social Security offices overwhelmed, experts say this is deliberate sabotage aimed at deterring lawful immigration under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201dSource: The GuardianTrump Wants to Cut Tribal College Funding by Nearly 90%, Putting Them at Risk of ClosingWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget proposal would slash federal funding for tribal colleges by nearly 90%, dropping postsecondary support from over $182 million to just $22 million. Education leaders say the move would force most tribal colleges to shut down, gutting institutions created to serve Indigenous students and preserve Native culture.Why It Matters: Tribal colleges are already underfunded by $250 million annually. Instead of fixing this, Trump\u2019s cuts would break trust obligations to Native communities, strip educational opportunities, and devastate economic lifelines in some of the country\u2019s poorest regions.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFEMA staff baffled after head said he was unaware of US hurricane season, sources sayWhat Happened: FEMA Administrator David Richardson stunned agency staff by saying he didn\u2019t know the U.S. had a hurricane season\u2014on the second day of it. The remark, whether a joke or not, comes as Trump purges FEMA staff, cancels hurricane prep plans, and weakens federal disaster response infrastructure.Why It Matters: Trump installed a FEMA chief with no disaster response experience while gutting the agency. As hurricane risks mount, FEMA is unprepared, the leadership is dangerously out of touch, and Americans will suffer as a result.Source: ReutersSocial security employees warn of delays: What the new priorities means for your benefitsWhat Happened: Social Security employees are raising alarms that routine services\u2014like address updates, direct deposit changes, and Medicaid billing corrections\u2014are being sidelined as they\u2019re ordered to prioritize nearly 900,000 complex cases tied to the new Social Security Fairness Act.Why It Matters: The agency is under pressure to finish the manual processing of retroactive payments to public workers by July 1, but insiders warn it\u2019s coming at the cost of basic services. Beneficiaries may see delays or interruptions in checks, as understaffed processing centers scramble to meet politically driven deadlines.Source: USA TodayTrump officials crafting rule to prevent asylum-seekers from getting work permitsWhat Happened: Trump officials are drafting a rule to block most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, pausing a decades-old policy. The plan would require cases to be resolved within 180 days \u2014 a near-impossible standard \u2014 and increase the waiting period to one year.Why It Matters: The move would leave thousands unable to support themselves, pushing them into the underground economy. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown to make the U.S. inhospitable to asylum-seekers.Source: CBS NewsCOVID vaccine changes confuse and upset some parents and familiesWhat Happened: The CDC and FDA have dropped recommendations for routine COVID vaccinations for healthy pregnant women, children, and adults under 65 without underlying conditions. Insurers may now refuse coverage, and future boosters will only be approved for high-risk groups.Why It Matters: Public health experts warn the move undermines trust, reduces protection for vulnerable family members, and may worsen health outcomes\u2014especially for those at indirect risk like newborns and immunocompromised relatives.Source: NPR\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump sparks Europe\u2019s 'new Enlightenment'What Happened: Trump\u2019s crackdown on U.S. higher education\u2014cutting funding, attacking DEI, and suppressing academic freedom\u2014has sparked global concern. In response, the EU launched a \u20ac500 million \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d initiative to attract affected American scholars, offering fast-track visas, major research grants, and long-term support. Universities in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are actively recruiting academics pushed out by Trump\u2019s ideological purge.Why It Matters: As Trump\u2019s extremist agenda drives scholars into silence or exile, Europe is seizing the moment to become the world\u2019s academic hub. A transatlantic brain drain is underway, with U.S. researchers fleeing censorship and fear. Europe is betting on freedom of thought\u2014while America burns its intellectual legacy.Source: Politico EuropeGazprom Abandons Idea of Turkish Backdoor to Europe\u2019s Gas MarketWhat Happened: Gazprom has quietly scrapped its plan to build a gas hub in Turkey\u2014an initiative pushed by the Kremlin to reenter European markets after losing Nord Stream and Ukrainian transit routes. The project collapsed due to limited Turkish pipeline capacity and Ankara\u2019s refusal to let Gazprom control gas marketing.Why It Matters: This is a sharp defeat for Putin\u2019s energy leverage campaign. With Europe once generating $8 billion a month for Gazprom and an EU-wide Russian gas ban looming by 2027, another Kremlin strategy to regain dominance has unraveled.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchHegseth will skip a meeting on organizing military aid to Ukraine in a first for the USWhat Happened: For the first time since its creation, the U.S. defense secretary will not attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting. Pete Hegseth won\u2019t appear in person or virtually as over 50 nations gather to coordinate military support for Ukraine.Why It Matters: The move is no surprise\u2014Hegseth\u2019s refusal to attend is part of a broader pattern as Trump shields Russia and sidelines Ukraine. With military aid frozen and pressure mounting on Kyiv to surrender, the message is clear: the U.S. is retreating.Source: Associated PressUkraine Hits Key Crimean Bridge with Underwater BlastWhat Happened: Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service used underwater explosives to damage the base of the illegal Kerch bridge linking Russia to occupied Crimea. The strike follows a major drone attack on Russia\u2019s bomber fleet.Why It Matters: The illegal bridge is a critical supply route for Russian forces and a major symbol of Russia\u2019s occupation. Ukraine\u2019s bold strikes defy the narrative of Ukrainian weakness and come ahead of Zelenskyy\u2019s NATO summit attendance\u2014later this month.Source: The GuardianOfficial Involved in Withholding Ukraine Aid Confirmed for Defense RoleWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed Michael Duffey\u2014who infamously ordered the freeze on Ukraine military aid in Trump\u2019s first term\u2014to serve as undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. Why It Matters: Duffey helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s Ukraine extortion plot that got him impeached. Now he\u2019s in charge of Pentagon weapons. Source: ReutersTrump Official Who Dismantled Russia Disinfo Unit Tied to Kremlin via Wife\u2019s FamilyWhat Happened: Darren Beattie, the Trump appointee who shut down the State Department\u2019s U.S. State Department\u2019s Russia disinformation agency, is married to Yulia Kirillova\u2014whose uncle has been thanked by Putin and held Kremlin posts. Beattie, previously ousted for white nationalist ties, is known for disseminating pro-Kremlin and anti-NATO propaganda.Why It Matters: A Trump official with direct family links to the Kremlin dismantled the U.S.\u2019s primary Russia disinformation watchdog while echoing Putin\u2019s worldview. More infiltration by Kremlin assets into the U.S. agencies\u2014undermining national security from within.Source: The TelegraphFar Right Expands Cultural War Through Publishing IndustryWhat Happened: A network of far-right publishers\u2014Passage Press, Ark Press, and Foundation Publishing Group\u2014is using books, homeschooling content, and exclusive events to legitimize extremist ideology. Led by Jonathan Keeperman and Daniel Lisi, they promote authors like Curtis Yarvin and Steve Sailer, blending reactionary politics with elite cultural packaging.Why It Matters: This is the Trump-aligned far right\u2019s cultural front\u2014an effort to normalize white nationalism, patriarchy, and authoritarianism through literature and education. By sidestepping traditional media and academia, they\u2019re building a long-term ideological foundation to influence youth and reshape society.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump tariffs stoke supply chain worries for US businesses, survey showsWhat Happened: A new survey shows 90% of U.S. business owners fear Trump\u2019s tariffs will disrupt supply chains, raise costs, and destabilize operations. The trade war has already cost companies over $34 billion in losses.Why It Matters: Business leaders are bracing for chaos. Trump\u2019s tariffs are piling onto already strained supply chains, threatening economic stability just as global risks mount.Source: ReutersOECD Warns Trump Tariffs Will Slow U.S. Economy, Spike InflationWhat Happened: The OECD slashed U.S. growth forecasts due to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, predicting GDP will drop to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. The effective tariff rate has surged to its highest since 1938, triggering inflation concerns.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to raise prices for consumers, drag down investment, and shake business confidence. Inflation could hit 3.9% by year\u2019s end, and the economic outlook is \u201cskewed to the downside,\u201d the OECD said.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite on June 6th in D.C.Judge Blocks Trump Plan to Revoke COVID School AidWhat Happened: A federal judge extended an injunction blocking Trump from canceling over $1.1 billion in unspent Covid relief funds meant for schools in 16 states and D.C.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Corruption is the Point \u2014 From Musk\u2019s federal grift to inaugural donors getting SEC settlements and ambassadorships, Trump\u2019s regime is openly auctioning off policy to the highest bidder.Civil Service Under Siege \u2014 With rules allowing mass firings in days, Trump is eroding federal protections to install loyalists and dismantle institutional independence.America\u2019s Brain Drain Has Begun \u2014 Trump\u2019s attack on higher education is driving top researchers out of the U.S., and Europe is welcoming them with funding, visas, and support.Institutions Are Being Hollowed Out \u2014 From FEMA\u2019s hurricane denial to the dismantling of Russia disinfo watchdogs, key agencies are spiraling under unqualified leadership and political sabotage.Crypto and Corruption Converge \u2014 Trump\u2019s crypto deals and ETF push show how public office is being used to inflate personal profits, collapsing boundaries between government and business.Human Rights Are Under Assault \u2014 From rescinding emergency abortion protections to targeting tribal colleges and jailing immigrant students, Trump is weaponizing bureaucracy against the vulnerable.Kremlin Assets Inside Government \u2014 Kremlin-linked officials and propaganda enablers have infiltrated top national security roles, dismantling U.S. defenses from the inside.Accountability Has Collapsed \u2014 The DOJ is a shield for loyalists and a sword against critics\u2014prosecutorial discretion replaced by political vengeance.Civil Rights Under Attack \u2014 From erasing LGBTQ+ military honors and Black heroes to revoking abortion emergency care, Trump\u2019s policies are systematically dismantling decades of civil rights progress.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Just as Orb\\u00E1n forced CEU out of Hungary, Trump is using funding freezes, visa threats, and political interference to attack academic freedom.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is about control. What began with universities in Hungary is now happening in America\\u2014just as in Russia, where academic freedom was crushed to silence dissent and enforce loyalty.

Education leaders say the move would force most tribal colleges to shut down, gutting institutions created to serve Indigenous students and preserve Native culture.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Tribal colleges are already underfunded by $250 million annually.

The remark, whether a joke or not, comes as Trump purges FEMA staff, cancels hurricane prep plans, and weakens federal disaster response infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump installed a FEMA chief with no disaster response experience while gutting the agency.
