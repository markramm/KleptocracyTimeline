California sued over the L.A. deployment, arguing it violated the act, while legal experts warn the regime is \u201cdancing around\u201d the law\u2019s limits to expand military roles at home.Source: Associated PressTrump Advisers Consider Changes to How Government Collects Jobs DataWhat Happened: After firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer over weak jobs numbers, Trump is pushing to overhaul how the government collects and reports employment data. He plans to install loyalist E.J. Antoni, who has called for suspending monthly jobs reports, raising fears that the White House will manipulate economic data to fit Trump\u2019s political narrative.Why It Matters: Trump wants to weaponize economic statistics for his own gain. By undermining the independence of the BLS, he risks eroding global trust in U.S. economic data\u2014turning jobs reports into propaganda instead of a cornerstone of market stability.Source: Wall Street Journal and Associated PressAppeals Court Allows DOGE Access to Sensitive Data at Several AgenciesWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled to grant unauthorized DOGE broad access to sensitive personal data from the Treasury, Education, and Office of Personnel Management. The decision, citing a June Supreme Court order, allows unvetted DOGE operatives to pull information on millions of Americans, including addresses, employment details, and student debt records.Why It Matters: This ruling gives a secretive Trump unit sweeping access to Americans\u2019 personal and financial data, fast-tracking a surveillance state and gutting privacy protections for Americans.Source: New York TimesTrump threatens Fed chair Powell with \u2018major lawsuit,\u2019 demands interest rate cutWhat Happened: Trump threatened a \u201cmajor lawsuit\u201d against Fed Chair Jerome Powell, blasting him over renovation costs at the Fed\u2019s headquarters while demanding immediate rate cuts. The attack escalates Trump\u2019s campaign to bully the independent central bank into doing his bidding.Why It Matters: Trump is openly weaponizing legal threats to hijack monetary policy. By continuing to use the Fed as a political target, he risks wrecking economic stability to serve his own power and election needs.Source: CNBC\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump ally Ken Paxton escalates Texas redistricting fight with call for Beto O\u2019Rourke to be jailedWhat Happened: Texas AG Ken Paxton demanded Beto O\u2019Rourke be jailed for supporting Democrats boycotting a GOP plan to add five Republican U.S. House seats. Why It Matters: This is a classic authoritarian tactic\u2014criminalizing dissent, in this case, to push through maps that could lock in GOP control of Congress. It shows how Trump\u2019s allies are willing to weaponize law enforcement to crush opposition and rig elections.Source: Associated PressTrump sidesteps Senate and judiciary with some U.S. attorney picksWhat Happened: Trump is bypassing the Senate and federal judges to keep loyalists in key U.S. attorney roles, using Vacancies Act loopholes and DOJ maneuvers after courts rejected his picks. Appointees like ex-personal lawyer Alina Habba and John Sarcone face allegations of bias and using their offices for political ends.Why It Matters: This undermines judicial oversight and Senate confirmation, letting Trump weaponize federal prosecutions to target opponents, protect allies, and pressure the courts.Source: CBS NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsWhite House launching review of Smithsonian museums to \"ensure alignment\" with Trump's plansWhat Happened: Trump is reviewing eight Smithsonian museums \u2014 including the National Museum of African American History and Culture \u2014 to \u201cremove divisive or ideologically driven language\u201d and \u201ccelebrate American exceptionalism.\u201d Under a March executive order, the review will scrutinize exhibits, collections, and curation processes, with required \u201ccontent corrections,\u201d within 120 days.Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented federal intervention into the nation\u2019s top cultural institutions, politicizing history that aligns with Trump\u2019s extremist ideology. It threatens the Smithsonian\u2019s independence and is intended to erase or rewrite exhibits that conflict with his preferred narrative of American history. It\u2019s part of an authoritarian playbook to control culture, memory, and the future.Source: CBS News and Associated PressComer: Bill Clinton \u2018Prime Suspect\u2019 in Epstein InvestigationWhat Happened: House Oversight Chair James Comer said Bill Clinton is a \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the GOP-led probe into Jeffrey Epstein, citing reports of Clinton\u2019s alleged visits to Epstein\u2019s island. Comer has subpoenaed both Clintons and warned that refusal to testify could trigger contempt charges\u2014enforced by Pam Bondi.Why It Matters: Comer is weaponizing Congress to resurrect conspiracy-driven attacks on Trump\u2019s rivals. By fixating on the Clintons, MAGA keeps its culture war alive while deflecting from Trump\u2019s own ties to Epstein and mounting corruption scandals. Instead of actually investigating these horrific crimes and the cover-up, Trump\u2019s cronies are exploiting them for political gain. This is what a sham investigation looks like.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJudge orders ICE to improve conditions after NYC immigration detainees complain of mistreatmentWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered ICE to address poor conditions at its 26 Federal Plaza facility in New York after detainees reported being denied food, medicine, and basic care. The ruling follows mounting complaints from immigrants held in the building\u2019s 10th-floor detention area.Why It Matters: The case spotlights ICE\u2019s human rights violations of detainees and the use of substandard holding sites in the heart of a major city. Source: Associated PressWhite House suggests homeless in DC could be fined, jailedWhat Happened: The White House said homeless people in D.C. could face fines or jail if they refuse shelters or treatment. Trump\u2019s federal takeover of the city\u2019s police will enforce the crackdown, with relocation \u201cfar from the Capital\u201d under consideration.Why It Matters: Trump is criminalizing poverty and homelessness under the guise of public safety. By threatening jail for the homeless, his regime is turning social failure into political theater\u2014weaponizing police power to display control rather than address root causes.Source: The HillTrump's remarks on homelessness in DC spark concerns among homeless advocatesWhat Happened: Trump vowed to clear all homeless encampments from Washington, D.C., declaring the \u201chomeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY.\u201d He said they would be relocated \u201cfar from the Capital\u201d \u2014 his spelling error \u2014 but advocates blasted the vague, punitive plan that lacks housing, transport, or civil rights safeguards, and D.C.\u2019s mayor said the White House gave no details.Why It Matters: Trump is threatening to forcibly disappear vulnerable people using his control of D.C.\u2019s police. It mirrors his immigration crackdowns\u2014sweeping people out of sight instead of solving the crisis, and shredding dignity, Constitutional, and basic human rights in the process.Source: ABC NewsOver 60,000 Are in Immigration Detention, a Modern High, Records ShowWhat Happened: ICE records show over 60,000 immigrants are now in detention\u2014the highest number on record and nearly double the daily average under Obama. Trump has expanded ICE\u2019s budget, used military bases for detention, and even deployed National Guard units, fusing military power with immigration enforcement.Why It Matters: This is the mass incarceration of immigrants on an unprecedented scale. Trump is normalizing military-backed detention camps inside the U.S., laying the groundwork for a permanent system of fear, repression, and state-run prisons for entire communities.Source: New York TimesTrump's moves are making immigration courts dysfunctionalWhat Happened: Trump has gutted immigration courts by firing judges, capping their numbers, and pressuring them to fast-track deportations. With nearly 4 million pending cases and fewer than 650 judges, due process rights are being shredded as bond release is eliminated and courts are overwhelmed by mass arrests.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling judicial independence to fuel his deportation machine. By breaking the immigration court system, he\u2019s replacing due process with mass expulsions\u2014transforming the courts into instruments of state power.Source: MSNBC\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s tax law will mostly benefit the rich, while leaving poorer Americans with less, CBO saysWhat Happened: A CBO report found Trump\u2019s spending law will cut incomes for the poorest Americans by about $1,200 a year while boosting the richest 10% by $13,600. The law makes Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts permanent, adds new spending, and imposes restrictions on Medicaid, food aid, and other assistance.Why It Matters: This cements a massive wealth transfer to the rich while stripping aid from millions of low-income Americans. It\u2019s trickle-down economics on steroids \u2014 deepening inequality and weakening the social safety net.Source: CNBCMillions of Americans Are Ignoring Their Student Loan BillsWhat Happened: Millions of Americans are ignoring their student loan bills as payments resume after a five-year pause. With $1.6 trillion in outstanding debt, only a third of borrowers are paying; others say they can\u2019t afford it or are refusing out of protest, despite the risks of credit damage and wage garnishment.Why It Matters: This mass nonpayment signals both financial desperation and political defiance. Trump\u2019s attacks on higher education and new restrictions on aid have made debt a flashpoint\u2014turning student loans into a battleground over inequality, generational fairness, and government legitimacy.Source: BloombergTrump law will cut food stamps for 2.4 million people as work rules widenWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s law expanding work requirements for food stamps will strip benefits from 2.4 million Americans, including parents of teens, older adults up to 64, veterans, and the homeless. The CBO found the cuts shift resources away from the poorest households while boosting incomes for wealthier Americans.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on the poor, punishing struggling families while rewarding the rich. Millions will face hunger as Trump turns food assistance into another weapon of class warfare.Source: The GuardianEvery VA medical center has severe staffing shortages, audit findsWhat Happened: A watchdog report revealed all 139 VA medical centers face severe staffing shortages, with reports of critical gaps rising 50% from last year. The shortages come as Trump pushes workforce purges of up to 30,000 employees, even as demand from veterans surges under the PACT Act.Why It Matters: Veterans are being left without timely, quality care as Trump\u2019s cuts hollow out the VA system. Gutting the workforce while vilifying employees is worsening burnout, slashing services, and breaking America\u2019s promise to those who served.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHuman Rights Report Under Trump Blunts Language on Israel and El SalvadorWhat Happened: The State Department\u2019s annual human rights report cut or omitted language on abuses in countries like Israel, El Salvador, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE \u2014 all close Trump allies. The report also reframed sections to defend right-wing leaders, including Jair Bolsonaro, while reducing criticism of authoritarian governments such as China and Russia.Why It Matters: This marks a deliberate shift from documenting abuses to shielding favored regimes, turning a fact-based accountability tool into political propaganda. By erasing or downplaying violations, the Trump regime undermines U.S. credibility and greenlights impunity for allied autocrats.Source: New York TimesState Dept. human rights reports scale back criticism of El Salvador, but fault U.K., GermanyWhat Happened: The State Department\u2019s latest human rights reports watered down or erased criticism of countries like El Salvador and Hungary, while ramping up attacks on allies such as the U.K., Germany, and France. Entire sections on LGBTQ discrimination, gender-based violence, systemic racism, and child exploitation were stripped out to match Trump\u2019s directives.Why It Matters: Gutting key sections erases the abuses faced by marginalized communities and weaponizes a once-bipartisan human rights tool for Trump\u2019s political ends\u2014 sending a message that the U.S. is no longer a defender of human rights.Source: CBS NewsReport Shows Canadians Are Boycotting the U.S. in DrovesWhat Happened: Canadian travel to the U.S. has plummeted for seven straight months, with July auto trips down 36.9% and air travel down 25.8% year-over-year. The drop follows Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and autos and ICE\u2019s aggressive immigration raids, while travel from Canada to other global destinations has risen nearly 6%.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s policies are driving away one of America\u2019s closest allies and biggest tourist markets. The boycott underscores how his economic warfare and police-state tactics are eroding cross-border ties and damaging U.S. soft power.Source: Daily Beast\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump to Meet Putin at U.S. Military Base in AnchorageWhat Happened: Trump will meet Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska on Friday. The meeting comes as Russia escalates its genocidal war in Ukraine, with Trump floating \u201cland swap\u201d deals Kyiv has rejected and allowing U.S. sanctions on Moscow to erode.Why It Matters: Trump is welcoming a war criminal onto a U.S. military base \u2014 a symbolic gift of legitimacy to Putin. By dangling Ukrainian territory and weakening sanctions, he\u2019s edging toward normalizing Russia\u2019s invasion while betraying Ukraine and America\u2019s allies.Source: New York TimesRussia Is Suspected to Be Behind Breach of Federal Court Filing SystemWhat Happened: Investigators say Russia is behind a hack of the federal courts\u2019 document system, exposing sealed records tied to national security cases and overseas criminal networks. The breach, described as part of a years-long infiltration, forced emergency steps to pull files offline and reroute filings away from PACER.Why It Matters: The hack risks blowing intelligence sources, crippling investigations, and giving Moscow a roadmap of U.S. cases against its operatives. It\u2019s a stark reminder of Russia\u2019s ongoing cyberwar \u2014 one Trump keeps downplaying even as he prepares to meet Putin.Source: New York TimesPete Hegseth belongs to an archconservative church network. Here\u2019s what to knowWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth is a member of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, whose pastors have argued women should not have the right to vote and embrace a patriarchal, Christian nationalist worldview. Hegseth publicly endorsed a video highlighting these views and attends a CREC church near Nashville, as the network expands ties to Trump officials.Why It Matters: The Pentagon\u2019s top civilian leader embracing an extremist church that rejects women\u2019s rights shreds church-state separation and normalizes misogyny in the military and U.S. government. It cements Christian nationalism\u2019s grip on U.S. government power.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump rebukes Goldman's Solomon over bank's tariff researchWhat Happened: Trump lashed out at Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon after the bank reported U.S. consumers had absorbed 22% of tariff costs, warning the figure could rise to 67%. Trump mocked Solomon\u2019s DJ hobby, saying he should \u201cnot bother running a major Financial Institution,\u201d and demanded Goldman hire a \u201cnew economist\u201d after it warned tariffs would hit growth.Why It Matters: Trump is using public humiliation to bully Wall Street into backing his tariff narrative. By publicly lashing out at banks for economic analysis, he\u2019s politicizing financial data, attempting to silence dissent, and eroding the independent judgment of his policies.Source: ReutersTrump's BLS nominee E.J. Antoni suggests suspending monthly jobs reportWhat Happened: E.J. Antoni, Trump\u2019s Project 2025 nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggested halting the agency\u2019s monthly jobs report in favor of slower quarterly data, calling the current figures flawed and unreliable. Antoni is a Heritage Foundation fellow and Project 2025 contributor.Why It Matters: Pausing the monthly jobs report would strip businesses, investors, and the public of a critical, timely economic gauge. It underscores Trump\u2019s push to manipulate the flow of economic data to control the political narrative\u2014just like in Russia.Source: CBS NewsUS national debt reaches a record $37 trillion, the Treasury Department reportsWhat Happened: The Treasury Department reported that U.S. gross national debt has hit a record $37 trillion\u2014years ahead of pre-pandemic projections\u2014driven by COVID-era borrowing and Trump\u2019s new tax cut and spending law, which will add $4.1 trillion more over the next decade. The U.S. is now adding $1 trillion in debt every five months.Why It Matters: Exploding debt fuels higher interest rates, raises costs for Americans, and crowds out critical investments. At this pace, the economy faces mounting instability as borrowing becomes a permanent fixture of national policy.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Republican Rep.

It underscores Trump\u2019s push to manipulate the flow of economic data to control the political narrative\u2014just like in Russia.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-bls-nominee-e-j-antoni-suspending-monthly-jobs-report/\" rel=\"\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">US national debt reaches a record $37 trillion, the Treasury Department reports<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7us-national-debt-reaches-a-record-trillion-the-treasury-department-reports\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/170794156/us-national-debt-reaches-a-record-trillion-the-treasury-department-reports\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> The Treasury Department reported that U.S. gross national debt has hit a record $37 trillion\u2014years ahead of pre-pandemic projections\u2014driven by COVID-era borrowing and Trump\u2019s new tax cut and spending law, which will add $4.1 trillion more over the next decade.

of American goods and travel.</span></p><p><span>Many articles cite tarrifs, a weak Canadian dollar, and the increased risk of illegal detention as the reasons for our absence. While the last one is certainly true, the primary reason Canadians are refusing to travel south is because of Trump's threats to our sovereignty. His repeated calls to make us the \"51st state\" has made Canadians incredibly angry. Our refusal to travel isn't based on fear or economics - it's based on rage and revenge. If the tarrifs were lifted tomorrow, Canadians would still not visit America. </span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full
