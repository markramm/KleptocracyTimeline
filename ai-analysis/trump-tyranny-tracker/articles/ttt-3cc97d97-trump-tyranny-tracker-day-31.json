  "content": "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Photo: nathan Howard/ReutersShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 19Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump to Attend Saudi-Backed Investment Meeting in MiamiWhat Happened: Trump will speak at a Saudi wealth fund\u2013hosted business meeting in Miami, seeking U.S. investments amid tensions over his Gaza proposal. Jared Kushner, who secured billions from the fund for his firm, and other Trump family members with Saudi ties will also attend.Why It Matters: This highlights Trump's transactional diplomacy and highlights corruption and conflict of interest as family business dealings intersect with government affairs.Source: The Washington PostDr. Phil Wants to Sell You Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw joined ICE raids in Chicago, filming detainees while asking questions like, \"Where were you born?\" This follows McGraw\u2019s embrace of Trumpism, transitioning from a 2024 rally speaker to an immigration crackdown advocate. He also brokered a meeting between border czar Tom Homan and NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who softened sanctuary city policies.Why It Matters: McGraw\u2019s involvement blends cop propaganda with trash TV, normalizing harsh immigration policies under the guise of entertainment. This spectacle reflects how celebrity influence can be weaponized to sanitize state-sponsored cruelty, further eroding civil liberties.Source: Mother JonesMusk Group Pumps Millions into Wisconsin Supreme Court RaceWhat Happened: A Musk backed group, Building America\u2019s Future, is spending $1.5 million to support GOP candidate Brad Schimel in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Musk personally endorsed Schimel, citing \u201celection fraud\u201d concerns. This comes as Musk expands influence beyond Washington into state-level politics.Why It Matters: The Wisconsin Supreme Court race could reshape voting rights, abortion access, and redistricting, with national implications for the 2026 elections. Musk\u2019s involvement highlights his deepening role in advancing conservative political power nationwide and buying elections.Source: PoliticoTrump\u2019s FBI Pick to Profit from Fashion Giant SheinWhat Happened: Kash Patel received stock compensation valued between $1 million and $5 million from Elite Depot, Shein\u2019s parent company, during a nine-month consulting stint. Although he agreed to divest shares in companies like Meta if confirmed, he plans to retain his Elite Depot stake, highlighting a conflict of interest given the firm's Chinese ties.Why It Matters: Holding financial interests in a foreign-linked company while leading the FBI undermines impartiality and endangers national security. Patel\u2019s profit-driven incentives risk sensitive information being misused to sway his decisions, echoing authoritarian regimes where personal loyalty and financial gain take precedence.Source: Wall Street JournalWhat we know about the US rare earth minerals deal rejected by Ukraine, according to sourcesWhat Happened: Trump offered Ukraine a rare earth minerals deal, demanding 50% control of Ukraine's mining and natural resource sectors as compensation for past U.S. aid. Ukrainian President Zelensky rejected the proposal, calling it against Ukraine\u2019s interests. The document presented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, specified the exact locations and types of resources sought.Why It Matters: This extortion attempt mirrors Trump\u2019s first-term pressure campaign against Ukraine, which led to his impeachment. It highlights how Trump continues to leverage U.S. power for personal and political gain, undermining U.S. foreign policy and allies.Source: CNNTrump's Agenda Calls for Adding Trillions of Dollars to U.S. DebtWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget plan, despite claims of \u201cfiscal responsibility,\u201d would add $5 to $11 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. His proposed tax cuts\u2014benefiting the wealthy and corporations\u2014dwarf any savings from slashing federal programs through Musk.Why It Matters: This isn't about balancing the budget\u2014it's about funneling money to Trump's billionaire allies while gutting social programs, education, and healthcare. The cuts target marginalized communities and government watchdogs, ensuring corruption goes unchecked while the debt skyrockets under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201dSource: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Power Grab Over Space Development Agency What Happened: The Air Force IG launched an investigation into the Space Development Agency following the sudden removal of its director, Derek Tournear. The probe will examine the agency\u2019s operations, contracts, and independence.Why It Matters: Tournear's removal indicates political meddling that disrupts SDA\u2019s rapid satellite acquisition process. This interference risks delaying crucial satellite launches and signals a broader effort to centralize space procurement under stricter Trump regime oversight.Source: Defense OneTrump to Issue Public Health Order to Restrict Border ImmigrationWhat Happened: Trump is preparing a public health order to label migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border as disease risks, citing measles and tuberculosis outbreaks. This move echoes the COVID-era Title 42 policy, which allowed swift expulsions of asylum seekers under public health grounds.Why It Matters: This order weaponizes emergency health powers to justify harsh immigration crackdowns. While framed as a health measure, it's a political tactic to block asylum seekers, setting a dangerous precedent for using emergency powers against political opposition in the future.Source: CNN\ud83d\udea8Musk Operatives Gain Access to Top U.S. Cybersecurity AgencyWhat Happened: Two Musk operatives\u201419-year-old Edward Coristine (aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d) and 38-year-old Kyle Schutt\u2014have been added to the staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a key division of the Department of Homeland Security. Previously tracked across multiple federal agencies, they now serve as senior advisors at CISA.Why It Matters: Their placement at CISA, which safeguards sensitive federal networks and election infrastructure, is a national security threat. This will compromise critical cybersecurity efforts and mirrors authoritarian tactics of placing loyalists in control of vital institutions to influence the outcome of elections.Source: WIREDTrump Picks Loyalists for Top Justice Department PostsWhat Happened: Trump nominated his cronies John Eisenberg to lead the DOJ's national security division, Brett Shumate for the civil division, and Patrick Davis for legislative affairs. Shumate, already defending Trump's federal worker purges, previously failed to uphold Trump's unconstitutional birthright citizenship order.Why It Matters: These appointments consolidate Trump's control over the DOJ, further politicizing the department and mirroring tactics seen in Russia. By installing loyalists, Trump ensures legal cover for controversial policies and crackdowns on opposition.Source: ReutersTrump Orders Pentagon to Plan Sweeping CutsWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the Pentagon to plan for 8% annual budget cuts over the next five years. Exemptions include Trump\u2019s border mission, nuclear weapons, missile defense, and attack drones. U.S. European, Central, and Africa Commands face potential reductions.Why It Matters: These cuts will undermine military readiness and U.S. global presence, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, while prioritizing Trump\u2019s domestic militarization agenda. Senior officials warn this could violate the law and jeopardize national security.Source: The Washington PostHegseth to Fire Generals as Early as This WeekWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering firing several military generals and senior officers as early as this week, targeting those linked to former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, diversity initiatives, or views deemed politically misaligned with Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: This purge further politicizes the military\u2019s leadership, undermining its independence and readiness while solidifying Trump\u2019s control over the armed forces\u2014an authoritarian move reminiscent of purges in autocratic regimes. Trump has repeatedly warned he will use the military against opposition and is removing anyone who might refuse illegal orders.Source: NBC News (Live Updates)Over 6,000 IRS Employees to Be Terminated This WeekWhat Happened: Trump plans to fire over 6,000 IRS workers\u2014more than 3,500 from the Small Business/Self-Employed Division\u2014as part of a broader purge targeting probationary employees deemed non-critical to the tax filing season.Why It Matters: These mass layoffs will disrupt essential IRS functions during peak tax season, affecting small business compliance and service delivery, highlighting the politically driven purges across federal agencies.Source: CBS News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsWashington Prosecutor Probes Threats Against DOGE, Targets SchumerWhat Happened: Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a Trump appointee, launched \"Operation Whirlwind\" to investigate threats against Elon Musk's unauthorized FAKE DOGE operatives. Martin named Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a target, citing his past comments about the Supreme Court.Why It Matters: This investigation is politically motivated, as Martin, known for defending January 6 insurrectionists and election denial, prioritizes threats against Musk\u2019s operatives while ignoring ongoing threats faced by federal prosecutors and judges. It highlights how Trump loyalists are beginning to weaponize the justice system to target political opponents.Source: ReutersTrump Calls for Federal Takeover of D.C.What Happened: Trump declared that the federal government should \u201ctake over the governance\u201d of Washington, D.C. Citing issues like crime, homelessness, and graffiti, he argued that D.C. needs stronger federal control to be run with \u201claw and order.\u201dWhy It Matters: This proposal challenges the longstanding local governance of the nation's capital and raises constitutional questions about federal overreach. It signals an authoritarian impulse to centralize power\u2014potentially disrupting the democratic framework in D.C. and further politicizing the federal government.Source: The HillThese Are the SpaceX Engineers Already Working Inside the FAAWhat Happened: Contrary to reports that they were merely touring the FAA, several SpaceX operatives have been formally onboarded at the agency. They were hired under Schedule A, a special authority designed to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities, bypassing the typical competitive hiring process.Why It Matters: This move blatantly politicizes federal hiring, using disability inclusion as a cover to fast-track SpaceX operatives from Musk\u2019s network, undermining agency integrity and bypassing proper vetting.Source: WIREDSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News\ud83d\udea8 Trump Signs Order to Claim Power Over Independent Agencies (From yesterday but extremely important)What Happened: Trump issued an executive order that forces independent agencies to submit proposed regulations for White House review, grants the OMB power to block spending on projects contrary to his policies, and mandates that these agencies follow Trump\u2019s and Justice Department\u2019s legal interpretations. This order targets agencies such as the SEC, FTC, FCC, and NLRB, and is part of a broader effort to centralize executive control over government functions.Why It Matters: Trump's executive order, declaring that only the president or the Attorney General can speak for \u201cwhat the law is,\u201d undermines the independence of regulatory bodies established by Congress. This move consolidates presidential power, erodes checks and balances, and allows Trump to bypass congressional intent and oversight\u2014paving the way for the unchecked executive overreach seen in dictatorships.Source: PoliticoAfter Ceding Power of the Purse, GOP lawmakers Beg Trump Team for FundsWhat Happened: Republican senators are lobbying Trump officials to release federal funds frozen by executive orders and Elon Musk. These freezes affect grants for farmers, infrastructure projects, Native American programs, and scientific research, prompting GOP lawmakers to beg for exceptions for their states.Why It Matters: This highlights how Trump\u2019s impoundment strategy has effectively stripped Congress of its constitutional \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d Lawmakers now rely on political favor to access funds, turning Congress into a subservient arm of the Trump regime, mirroring the rubber-stamp nature of Russia's State Duma.Source: The Washington PostMusk Released Data About Federal Contract Savings. It Doesn't Add UpWhat Happened: Elon Musk released an online tracker claiming $55 billion in federal contract savings. However, an NPR analysis revealed numerous discrepancies, including a glaring error where an ICE contract was initially listed as $8 billion, then corrected to $8 million, casting serious doubt on the overall figures.Why It Matters: These inflated and inconsistent numbers mirror authoritarian tactics\u2014fabricating achievements to justify drastic budget cuts and consolidate power. The manipulation undermines transparency, erodes public trust, and calls into question the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s cost-cutting agenda.Source: NPRTrump Declares New York \u2018Saved\u2019 From Congestion Pricing: \u2018Long Live the King!\u2019What Happened: Trump announced the end of New York's congestion pricing plan, which would have charged drivers $9 to enter parts of Manhattan. Trump celebrated the decision with the phrase \u201cLONG LIVE THE KING!\u201dWhy It Matters: This move weakens local governance and climate policies while reinforcing Trump's authoritarian style. His \u201cking\u201d remark and the release of an AI-generated \"King Trump\" photo from an official account further underscore his dictatorial instincts, echoing tactics seen in authoritarian regimes.Source: The Hill\u2018I feel like cruelty is the point\u2019: For many newly fired federal workers, the way they were let go made things much worseWhat Happened: Thousands of federal workers, primarily probationary employees, were abruptly terminated as part of the Trump\u2019s purge led by Elon Musk. Many discovered their dismissal through impersonal emails, revoked computer access, or prepaid UPS labels for returning equipment.Why It Matters: The chaotic, callous terminations are a textbook example of authoritarian tactics aimed at intimidating and silencing dissent. The murky details around health benefits, severance, and retirement plans only compound the cruelty of this purge.Source: CNN\u201cThey\u2019re Scared Shitless\u201d: Trump\u2019s Rhetoric Fuels Fear of Political Violence in GOPWhat Happened: Over the past few weeks, Trump\u2019s aggressive and inflammatory rhetoric has spurred fear among some of his Republican lawmakers. Incidents such as Trump's lies against Zelenskyy and his mass pardoning of Jan. 6 insurrectionists have created an atmosphere where some GOP members are reportedly too frightened to oppose his actions. Lawmakers have shared that threats\u2014both direct and implicit\u2014are influencing their decision-making.Why It Matters: This climate of fear erodes checks and balances, paving the way for authoritarian rule by silencing legislative decision-making and enabling political violence as a tool for power consolidation.Source: Vanity Fair\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsAn 11-year-old girl in Texas died by suicide after she was bullied about her family\u2019s immigration statusWhat Happened: Eleven year old Jocelynn Rojo Carranza died by suicide in Gainesville, Texas, after being relentlessly bullied at school about her family\u2019s immigration status. Her mother, Marbella Carranza, said bullies threatened to call immigration to deport her parents.Why It Matters: This heartbreaking and infuriating tragedy highlights the real-world consequences of hateful rhetoric and is a direct result of Trump and MAGA. Trump and his MAGA movement have vilified Latinos as vermin, criminals, and rapists, creating a hostile environment that endangers vulnerable children and undermines the dignity and safety of immigrant communities.Source: CNN\ud83d\udea8Lawyers helping migrant children facing deportation ordered by Trump to \"stop all work\"What Happened: Trump ordered legal service groups assisting migrant children facing deportation to \u201cstop all work,\u201d halting federally funded legal aid, including \u201cknow your rights\u201d sessions and legal screenings. This affects nearly 26,000 children currently or previously in U.S. government custody.Why It Matters: By stripping vulnerable children of legal representation, the regime is effectively denying them due process and increasing their risk of deportation, exploitation, and trafficking. This aligns with Trump\u2019s broader effort to dismantle immigration protections under the guise of efficiency and highlights the cruelty of the regime.Source: CBS NewsDonald Trump\u2019s Next Diversity Target: People With DisabilitiesWhat Happened: Trump is expanding its anti-DEI executive orders to target disability protections, including special education programs, workplace accommodations, and Medicaid-funded services. This move threatens decades of progress under the Americans with Disabilities Act.Why It Matters: This will devastate millions of disabled Americans who rely on federal protections and programs for employment, education, and healthcare. Trump's rhetoric blaming disabled air traffic controllers for accidents exemplifies how authoritarian regimes scapegoat marginalized groups to push their agenda.Source: The Nation9/11 Health Program Cuts Threaten Life-Saving Care for First RespondersWhat Happened: Days after RFK Jr. pledged to support 9/11 responders, Trump and Elon Musk cut up to 20% of staff from the World Trade Center Health Program. The layoffs, affecting probationary employees and buyouts, will delay critical healthcare services for those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses.Why It Matters: These cuts will delay critical care for first responders and survivors, betraying America\u2019s commitment to its 9/11 heroes. This callous, politically driven agenda puts the interests of the wealthy above the well-being of those who risked everything for the country.Source: USA TODAYUS deportees moved from Panama City to Dari\u00e9n jungle region, lawyer saysWhat Happened: Trump deported 299 non-Panamanian immigrants to Panama, 170 of whom were moved from a hotel in Panama City to the dangerous Dari\u00e9n jungle region. The deportees include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, and other countries, some of which refuse U.S. deportation flights. Panama now bears responsibility for their repatriation.Why It Matters: This move hands off deportation to a country that can't protect vulnerable immigrants, putting lives at risk and blatantly ignoring international human rights laws and commitments.Source: The GuardianKennedy Center cancels Gay Men\u2019s Chorus of Washington, D.C., performanceWhat Happened: The Kennedy Center canceled a May 21 performance by the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus of Washington, D.C., alongside the National Symphony Orchestra, following Trump\u2019s purge of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees and his self-appointment as chairman. The event traditionally kicks off national Pride Month celebrations.Why It Matters: This cancellation reflects Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on LGBTQ+ visibility and cultural expression, as part of his regime\u2019s push to eliminate what he calls \u201canti-American propaganda.\u201d It highlights how Trump is using cultural institutions to enforce ideological conformity\u2014a tactic seen in Russia.Source: NBC WashingtonU.S. pauses immigration applications for certain migrants welcomed under BidenWhat Happened: Trump paused all immigration applications from migrants admitted under Biden-era programs, including Uniting for Ukraine and CHNV, citing \u201cfraud and security concerns.\u201d This indefinite freeze affects hundreds of thousands of migrants already in the U.S. who were seeking legal status.Why It Matters: This leaves thousands of vulnerable migrants, including Ukrainians fleeing genocide, in legal limbo and at heightened risk of deportation. It is a clear effort to dismantle Biden-era immigration protections under the guise of national security, prioritizing a vengeful agenda over human rights.Source: CBS NewsNew Immigration and Customs Enforcement data shows the regime isn't just arresting criminalsWhat Happened: ICE detention numbers rose from 39,238 to 41,169 in just two weeks, with 41% of new detainees lacking criminal convictions or charges. The regime has begun transferring detainees to Guantanamo Bay, with plans to hold up to 30,000 immigrants there.Why It Matters: Despite claims to target criminals, the surge in non-criminal detentions and the use of Guantanamo for immigration detention reflect the Trump regime\u2019s aggressive, indiscriminate crackdown on migrants, prioritizing mass incarceration over due process.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFAA Job Cuts Affect Air Safety, Union WarnsWhat Happened: Trump fired around 400 FAA employees, including aviation safety assistants, maintenance mechanics, and nautical information specialists. While the regime claims no \"critical safety\" positions were cut, the union argues that these staffers supported inspectors, repaired air traffic control systems, and maintained pilot navigation maps.Why It Matters: These cuts weaken the safety net supporting air travel, increasing risks amid recent deadly accidents and an already understaffed FAA. Delays in inspections and infrastructure repairs will undermine aviation safety, reflecting the broader trend of politically motivated purges.Source: Associated PressTrump's Layoffs Hit Firefighter Safety ProgramsWhat Happened: Patrick Montague, an investigator for the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer, was fired along with others from his program by the Trump regime, citing his probationary status and performance issues.Why It Matters: Losing experienced safety investigators risks undermining efforts to protect firefighters and will delay crucial safety improvements, endangering first responders.Source: NBC NewsRFK Jr. Launches Childhood Vaccine Schedule Review, Says \u2018Nothing Off Limits\u2019What Happened: HHS Secretary RFK Jr. announced a presidential commission to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule, pesticides, psychiatric drugs, and other health factors, despite prior assurances not to undermine vaccine efforts.Why It Matters: His review will fuel more disinformation and undermine public health, especially as mass firings at HHS, CDC, and FDA weaken federal oversight.Source: The HillUSDS Engineering Director Resigns: \u2018This Is Not the Mission I Came to Serve\u2019What Happened: Anne Marshall, the director of data science and engineering at the United States Digital Service, resigned after only two months. Citing the indiscriminate layoffs that slashed one-third of her team, Marshall stated that Musk\u2019s actions had made it impossible for her to continue serving her mission.Why It Matters: Her resignation highlights deep concerns about Musk\u2019s disruptive management and the opaque leadership structure within unauthorized FAKE DOGE. Source: WIREDDepartment of Education Contract Cuts Spur \u201cChaos and Confusion\u201dWhat Happened: Trump slashed over $1 billion in contracts at the Department of Education, including $600 million in teacher training grants and an additional $350 million affecting the Institute of Education Sciences and Regional Educational Laboratories. The regime justified the cuts as eliminating \"woke\" and wasteful spending.Why It Matters: These cuts will disrupt essential education research and innovation, undermining efforts to improve learning outcomes and support underserved communities. The loss of critical funding will have lasting negative impacts on school performance and policy development.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump calls Zelensky \u2018a dictator\u2019What Happened: Trump called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d after the Ukrainian president said he is receiving Russian disinformation. Zelenskyy pointed out that Trump\u2019s lies\u2014that Ukraine started the war\u2014echoed Kremlin propaganda.Why It Matters: This underscores Trump\u2019s alignment with Russia\u2019s strategic interests, echoing his first-term rhetoric and actions. With no guardrails in place, Trump can now fully advance Moscow\u2019s agenda, undermining Ukraine and Europe while emboldening Putin\u2019s authoritarian bloody ambitions.Source: CNNICE Prosecutor in Dallas Runs White Supremacist X AccountWhat Happened: Texas Observer investigations have identified ICE Assistant Chief Counsel James Rodden as the operator of the racist X account \u201cGlomarResponder.\u201d The account, which boasts over 17,000 followers, regularly posts xenophobic and pro-fascist content. Why It Matters: This revelation raises serious questions about the impartiality and professionalism of ICE\u2019s legal representation in immigration court. This exposes bias and extremist influence, skewing justice against migrants and destroying public trust\u2014clear hate-driven policies reminiscent of authoritarian regimes.Source: Texas Observer\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsFederal Workers Protest Mass Layoffs NationwideWhat Happened: Federal workers and unions organized protests in over 30 cities across the U.S. under the \"Save Our Services Day of Action\" banner. They are demanding an end to mass layoffs, the funding freeze, and violations of union contracts following Trump\u2019s workforce purge, led by Elon Musk.Source: NPQCivil and human rights groups sue over Trump diversity, transgender ordersWhat Happened: The NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Lambda Legal filed National Urban League v.

The lawsuit argues these orders violate First Amendment rights and harm access to healthcare, housing, and employment.Source: The HillAppeals Court Blocks Trump\u2019s Birthright Citizenship OrderWhat Happened: The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declined an emergency request by the Justice Department to lift a block on Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented or temporary visa holders. The ruling, which sets the stage for further arguments in June, finds that the order likely violates constitutional protections for citizenship.Source: CNN\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers$1\u2013$5 million \u2014 Estimated stock compensation value from Elite Depot for FBI nominee Kash Patel.$1.5M \u2013 Total investment by Musk\u2019s Building America\u2019s Future to support GOP candidate Brad Schimel for Wisconsin Supreme Court.50% \u2014 Proposed share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth mineral revenue or ownership demanded in the extortian deal.$5\u2013$11 trillion \u2014 Projected increase in the national debt over 10 years under Trump\u2019s agenda.8% \u2014 Annual Pentagon budget cuts proposed over the next five years.6,000+ \u2014 IRS employees expected to be terminated this week, including over 3,500 from the SBSE division.170 of 299 \u2014 Deportees moved from Panama City to the Dari\u00e9n jungle region in Panama.400 \u2014 Approximate number of FAA probationary employees fired in the recent purge.41% \u2014 Proportion of new ICE detainees with no criminal convictions or pending charges.20% \u2013 Up to one-fifth of the staff at the World Trade Center Health Program have been cut.26,000 \u2013 Nearly 26,000 migrant children will lose federally funded legal services due to the stop work order.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextWill the judge block Trump\u2019s interference in the NYC Mayor\u2019s corruption case?

blunted.  Pummeled with unheard of, unprecedented lunacies, America is being desensitized to both the coup and its tyranny.  The idea of a monarchial executive composed of absolute third-raters is becoming normalized. News items that a year ago would have generated headlines are now considered humdrum. What once would have generated public outcry is now just a boring part of the daily news avalanche.  Thus do people allow shackles to be placed on them and lose their democracy.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 19</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3>Trump to Attend Saudi-Backed Investment Meeting in Miami</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump will speak at a Saudi wealth fund\\u2013hosted business meeting in Miami, seeking U.S. investments amid tensions over his Gaza proposal. Jared Kushner, who secured billions from the fund for his firm, and other Trump family members with Saudi ties will also attend.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This highlights Trump's transactional diplomacy and highlights corruption and conflict of interest as family business dealings intersect with government affairs.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/19/trump-presidency-news/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Dr. Phil Wants to Sell You Mass Deportations</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw joined ICE raids in Chicago, filming detainees while asking questions like, \\\\\\\"Where were you born?\\\\\\\" This follows McGraw\\u2019s embrace of Trumpism, transitioning from a 2024 rally speaker to an immigration crackdown advocate. He also brokered a meeting between border czar Tom Homan and NYC Mayor Eric Adams, who softened sanctuary city policies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>McGraw\\u2019s involvement blends cop propaganda with trash TV, normalizing harsh immigration policies under the guise of entertainment. This spectacle reflects how celebrity influence can be weaponized to sanitize state-sponsored cruelty, further eroding civil liberties.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/dr-phil-trump-mass-deportation-ice-raid-reality-tv/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Musk Group Pumps Millions into Wisconsin Supreme Court Race</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A Musk backed group, <em>Building America\\u2019s Future</em>, is spending $1.5 million to support GOP candidate Brad Schimel in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Musk personally endorsed Schimel, citing \\u201Celection fraud\\u201D concerns. This comes as Musk expands influence beyond Washington into state-level politics.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Wisconsin Supreme Court race could reshape voting rights, abortion access, and redistricting, with national implications for the 2026 elections. Musk\\u2019s involvement highlights his deepening role in advancing conservative political power nationwide and buying elections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/elon-musk-wisconsin-supreme-court-00204791\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s FBI Pick to Profit from Fashion Giant Shein</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Kash Patel received stock compensation valued between $1 million and $5 million from Elite Depot, Shein\\u2019s parent company, during a nine-month consulting stint. Although he agreed to divest shares in companies like Meta if confirmed, he plans to retain his Elite Depot stake, highlighting a conflict of interest given the firm's Chinese ties.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Holding financial interests in a foreign-linked company while leading the FBI undermines impartiality and endangers national security. Patel\\u2019s profit-driven incentives risk sensitive information being misused to sway his decisions, echoing authoritarian regimes where personal loyalty and financial gain take precedence.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/kash-patel-shein-trump-cabinet-pick-73da2e52?mod=hp_lead_pos4\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>What we know about the US rare earth minerals deal rejected by Ukraine, according to sources</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump offered Ukraine a rare earth minerals deal, demanding 50% control of Ukraine's mining and natural resource sectors as compensation for past U.S. aid. Ukrainian President Zelensky rejected the proposal, calling it against Ukraine\\u2019s interests. The document presented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, specified the exact locations and types of resources sought.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This extortion attempt mirrors Trump\\u2019s first-term pressure campaign against Ukraine, which led to his impeachment. It highlights how Trump continues to leverage U.S. power for personal and political gain, undermining U.S. foreign policy and allies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-doge-musk-02-19-25/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump's Agenda Calls for Adding Trillions of Dollars to U.S. Debt</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s budget plan, despite claims of \\u201Cfiscal responsibility,\\u201D would add $5 to $11 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. His proposed tax cuts\\u2014benefiting the wealthy and corporations\\u2014dwarf any savings from slashing federal programs through Musk.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This isn't about balancing the budget\\u2014it's about funneling money to Trump's billionaire allies while gutting social programs, education, and healthcare. The cuts target marginalized communities and government watchdogs, ensuring corruption goes unchecked while the debt skyrockets under the guise of \\u201Cefficiency.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/doge-trumps-agenda-calls-adding-trillions-dollars-us-debt-rcna191665\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Power Grab Over Space Development Agency </strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Air Force IG launched an investigation into the Space Development Agency following the sudden removal of its director, Derek Tournear. The probe will examine the agency\\u2019s operations, contracts, and independence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Tournear's removal indicates political meddling that disrupts SDA\\u2019s rapid satellite acquisition process. This interference risks delaying crucial satellite launches and signals a broader effort to centralize space procurement under stricter Trump regime oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/02/uncertainty-mounts-space-development-agency-air-force-ig-prepares-probe/403068/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story\\\\\\\">Defense One</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump to Issue Public Health Order to Restrict Border Immigration</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is preparing a public health order to label migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border as disease risks, citing measles and tuberculosis outbreaks. This move echoes the COVID-era Title 42 policy, which allowed swift expulsions of asylum seekers under public health grounds.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This order weaponizes emergency health powers to justify harsh immigration crackdowns. While framed as a health measure, it's a political tactic to block asylum seekers, setting a dangerous precedent for using emergency powers against political opposition in the future.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/border-health-immigration\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDEA8Musk Operatives Gain Access to Top U.S. Cybersecurity Agency</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Two Musk operatives\\u201419-year-old Edward Coristine (aka \\u201CBig Balls\\u201D) and 38-year-old Kyle Schutt\\u2014have been added to the staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a key division of the Department of Homeland Security. Previously tracked across multiple federal agencies, they now serve as senior advisors at CISA.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Their placement at CISA, which safeguards sensitive federal networks and election infrastructure, is a national security threat. This will compromise critical cybersecurity efforts and mirrors authoritarian tactics of placing loyalists in control of vital institutions to influence the outcome of elections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-cisa-coristine-cybersecurity/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Picks Loyalists for Top Justice Department Posts</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump nominated his cronies John Eisenberg to lead the DOJ's national security division, Brett Shumate for the civil division, and Patrick Davis for legislative affairs. Shumate, already defending Trump's federal worker purges, previously failed to uphold Trump's unconstitutional birthright citizenship order.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These appointments consolidate Trump's control over the DOJ, further politicizing the department and mirroring tactics seen in Russia. By installing loyalists, Trump ensures legal cover for controversial policies and crackdowns on opposition.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-picks-first-term-loyalists-top-justice-department-posts-2025-02-19/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Orders Pentagon to Plan Sweeping Cuts</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the Pentagon to plan for 8% annual budget cuts over the next five years. Exemptions include Trump\\u2019s border mission, nuclear weapons, missile defense, and attack drones. U.S. European, Central, and Africa Commands face potential reductions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These cuts will undermine military readiness and U.S. global presence, particularly in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, while prioritizing Trump\\u2019s domestic militarization agenda. Senior officials warn this could violate the law and jeopardize national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/19/trump-pentagon-budget-cuts/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Hegseth to Fire Generals as Early as This Week</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is considering firing several military generals and senior officers as early as this week, targeting those linked to former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, diversity initiatives, or views deemed politically misaligned with Trump\\u2019s agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This purge further politicizes the military\\u2019s leadership, undermining its independence and readiness while solidifying Trump\\u2019s control over the armed forces\\u2014an authoritarian move reminiscent of purges in autocratic regimes. Trump has repeatedly warned he will use the military against opposition and is removing anyone who might refuse illegal orders.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/live-blog/live-updates-trump-lori-chavez-deremer-cpac-rcna192744#rcrd73369\\\\\\\">NBC News </a>(Live Updates)</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Over 6,000 IRS Employees to Be Terminated This Week</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump plans to fire over 6,000 IRS workers\\u2014more than 3,500 from the Small Business/Self-Employed Division\\u2014as part of a broader purge targeting probationary employees deemed non-critical to the tax filing season.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These mass layoffs will disrupt essential IRS functions during peak tax season, affecting small business compliance and service delivery, highlighting the politically driven purges across federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/over-3500-irs-employees-expected-terminated-by-end-of-week/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Washington Prosecutor Probes Threats Against DOGE, Targets Schumer</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a Trump appointee, launched \\\\\\\"Operation Whirlwind\\\\\\\" to investigate threats against Elon Musk's unauthorized FAKE DOGE operatives. Martin named Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as a target, citing his past comments about the Supreme Court.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This investigation is politically motivated, as Martin, known for defending January 6 insurrectionists and election denial, prioritizes threats against Musk\\u2019s operatives while ignoring ongoing threats faced by federal prosecutors and judges. It highlights how Trump loyalists are beginning to weaponize the justice system to target political opponents.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/washington-prosecutor-probes-threats-against-doge-names-schumer-target-2025-02-19/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Calls for Federal Takeover of D.C.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump declared that the federal government should \\u201Ctake over the governance\\u201D of Washington, D.C. Citing issues like crime, homelessness, and graffiti, he argued that D.C. needs stronger federal control to be run with \\u201Claw and order.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This proposal challenges the longstanding local governance of the nation's capital and raises constitutional questions about federal overreach. It signals an authoritarian impulse to centralize power\\u2014potentially disrupting the democratic framework in D.C. and further politicizing the federal government.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5154624-trump-federal-government-take-over-dc/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>These Are the SpaceX Engineers Already Working Inside the FAA</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Contrary to reports that they were merely touring the FAA, several SpaceX operatives have been formally onboarded at the agency. They were hired under Schedule A, a special authority designed to increase <strong>employment opportunities for people with disabilities</strong>, bypassing the typical competitive hiring process.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move blatantly politicizes federal hiring, using disability inclusion as a cover to fast-track SpaceX operatives from Musk\\u2019s network, undermining agency integrity and bypassing proper vetting.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/faa-doge-elon-musk-space-x/?utm_content=bufferce958&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEA8 Trump Signs Order to Claim Power Over Independent Agencies (From yesterday but extremely important)</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump issued an executive order that forces independent agencies to submit proposed regulations for White House review, grants the OMB power to block spending on projects contrary to his policies, and mandates that these agencies follow Trump\\u2019s and Justice Department\\u2019s legal interpretations. This order targets agencies such as the SEC, FTC, FCC, and NLRB, and is part of a broader effort to centralize executive control over government functions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump's executive order, declaring that only the president or the Attorney General can speak for \\u201Cwhat the law is,\\u201D undermines the independence of regulatory bodies established by Congress. This move consolidates presidential power, erodes checks and balances, and allows Trump to bypass congressional intent and oversight\\u2014paving the way for the unchecked executive overreach seen in dictatorships.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/18/trump-order-power-independent-agencies-00204798\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>After Ceding Power of the Purse, GOP lawmakers Beg Trump Team for Funds</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Republican senators are lobbying Trump officials to release federal funds frozen by executive orders and Elon Musk. These freezes affect grants for farmers, infrastructure projects, Native American programs, and scientific research, prompting GOP lawmakers to beg for exceptions for their states.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This highlights how Trump\\u2019s impoundment strategy has effectively stripped Congress of its constitutional \\u201Cpower of the purse.\\u201D Lawmakers now rely on political favor to access funds, turning Congress into a subservient arm of the Trump regime, mirroring the rubber-stamp nature of Russia's State Duma.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/19/trump-musk-senators-funding/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Released Data About Federal Contract Savings. It Doesn't Add Up</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk released an online tracker claiming $55 billion in federal contract savings. However, an NPR analysis revealed numerous discrepancies, including a glaring error where an ICE contract was initially listed as $8 billion, then corrected to $8 million, casting serious doubt on the overall figures.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>These inflated and inconsistent numbers mirror authoritarian tactics\\u2014fabricating achievements to justify drastic budget cuts and consolidate power.

Trump celebrated the decision with the phrase \\u201CLONG LIVE THE KING!\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move weakens local governance and climate policies while reinforcing Trump's authoritarian style. His \\u201Cking\\u201D remark and the release of an AI-generated \\\\\\\"King Trump\\\\\\\" photo from an official account further underscore his dictatorial instincts, echoing tactics seen in

Her mother, Marbella Carranza, said bullies threatened to call immigration to deport her parents.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This heartbreaking and infuriating tragedy highlights the real-world consequences of hateful rhetoric and is a direct result of Trump and MAGA.
