  "content": "A view of the U.S. Department of Education building in Washington on Monday. (Pete Kiehart/For The Washington Post)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 3Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump\u2019s Meme Coin Rakes in $100M While Small Traders Lose BigWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s $Trump meme coin has generated up to $100 million in trading fees, while its value plummeted by two-thirds. Small traders lost money, while major investors and entities tied to Trump cashed in. His company, CIC Digital, is listed as a beneficiary of the fees. The ownership structure is opaque, with Delaware-registered firms like Fight Fight Fight and Celebration Cards receiving trading revenue.Why It Matters: This is blatant financial corruption and self-dealing, with Trump using the presidency to enrich himself through a highly speculative crypto venture. His regime is simultaneously rewriting crypto regulations, creating a massive conflict of interest as he profits off policies he controls. Like dictators who use state power to funnel money into their own pockets, Trump is leveraging public office for personal gain, leaving everyday investors to suffer.Source: ReutersSenate Confirms Fossil Fuel CEO Chris Wright as Energy SecretaryWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy, as Trump\u2019s new Energy Secretary in a 59-38 vote. Wright, a vocal opponent of climate policies, has pledged to advance Trump\u2019s \"drill, baby, drill\" agenda, prioritizing fossil fuel production while dismissing renewable energy initiatives. Wright will also serve on Trump\u2019s newly created National Energy Council, chaired by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to deregulate the energy industry and accelerate fossil fuel expansion.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling climate regulations and green energy policies, reversing Biden-era climate initiatives in favor of unchecked fossil fuel expansion. Wright's deep industry ties and lack of government experience raise concerns about conflicts of interest and corporate influence over U.S. energy policy. This appointment mirrors authoritarian strategies where industry executives seize government roles to serve corporate interests, weakening regulatory oversight and prioritizing profits over environmental and economic stability.Source: AP NewsCommerce pick with crypto ties could sit on crypto task forceWhat Happened: Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for Commerce Secretary, refuses to say whether he will recuse himself from the White House\u2019s crypto task force, despite financial ties to Tether, a stablecoin firm linked to illicit finance scandals. Lutnick holds a $600M bond in Tether through Cantor Fitzgerald but declined to disclose details in response to Senate inquiries. He also pledged full support for Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy trade agenda.Why It Matters: Lutnick\u2019s deep financial conflicts of interest raise ethical concerns as he would help craft crypto regulations while personally profiting from the industry. His Tether ties also pose national security risks, given its links to money laundering and illicit finance. His confirmation would further entrench Trump\u2019s pro-crypto policies, which critics say are designed to enrich insiders and weaken oversight.Source: PoliticoEric Trump Hypes Ethereum as Millions in ETH Flow to CoinbaseWhat Happened: Eric Trump promoted Ethereum (ETH) on social media, calling it a \u201cgreat time to buy,\u201d before later deleting part of his tweet. Meanwhile, World Liberty Finance, a DeFi venture linked to the Trump family, moved millions in ETH to exchanges, sparking speculation of insider trading. The firm\u2019s holdings dropped from $421M to $47M in ETH, following significant transfers to Coinbase, Lido, and Gnosis.Why It Matters: This further entrenches Trump\u2019s personal financial ties to crypto as his regime rewrites regulations favoring the industry. The coordinated social media hype and large-scale asset movements mirror classic pump-and-dump schemes, highlighting ethics and market manipulation concerns. Furthermore, Trump will craft government policies to enrich himself and his family\u2019s crypto ventures. Source: CryptoSlateTrump Ties Ukraine Military Aid to Rare Earth DealsWhat Happened: Trump demanded Ukraine trade rare earth elements and other critical minerals in exchange for continued U.S. military aid in its war against Russia\u2019s genocidal invasion. This corrupt move will attempt to secure U.S. access to valuable resources.Why It Matters: This turns foreign policy and military aid into a transactional deal and further shows U.S. has no plans on protecting democracies. Also, a large percentage of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is actually spent inside the U.S. on weapons production, making Trump\u2019s proposal an opportunistic move. The push mirrors Trump\u2019s past exploitation of foreign conflicts for financial gain, signaling corruption and coercion.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Moves to Dismantle the Department of EducationWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to sign an executive order directing the Education Secretary to draft a plan to dismantle the federal Department of Education, fulfilling a long-standing conservative goal. The order will call for Congress to pass legislation shutting it down, but an immediate closure is unlikely. Trump\u2019s nominee for Education Secretary, Linda McMahon, has not yet been confirmed, and a Senate vote to eliminate the department would likely fail without a two-thirds majority. Meanwhile, dozens of department employees have already been placed on administrative leave.Why It Matters: Eliminating the Department of Education would gut federal oversight of public schools, shifting control to the states and leaving low-income students without critical support. It would also jeopardize federal funding for K-12 education, including programs addressing achievement gaps and student loan protections. This move mirrors authoritarian tactics of weakening institutions to consolidate power and eliminate regulatory oversight.Source: ABC NewsKey State Department Programs \u2018Wiped Out\u2019 After Dozens of Contractors FiredWhat Happened: Trump has fired around 60 contractors of contractors at the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), gutting key programs advancing democracy and human rights worldwide. This follows stop-work orders on all foreign-aid contracts, part of Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed he is now acting head of USAID, where senior leadership has been ousted, employees were blocked from entering headquarters, and the website has gone offline. The cuts are being orchestrated by Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee reportedly seen at the January 6 Capitol insurrection.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on U.S. democracy promotion, benefiting authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. DRL has been essential in supporting pro-democracy movements, combating human rights abuses, and strengthening civil society abroad, and further shows America\u2019s tilt into authoritarianism. Also, with USAID also crippled, Trump is effectively erasing the U.S. role in global democratic leadership, paving the way for autocrats to expand their influence.Source: NOTUSGOP Officials Say Trump\u2019s Federal Worker Buyout Program Is IllegalWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime offered federal workers buyouts through September, despite Congress only funding the government until mid-March. GOP officials warn this violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, which bars unauthorized spending. The estimated cost could reach $50 billion, sparking legal concerns.Why It Matters: This is a purge of federal workers, bypassing legal budget limits to clear out career civil servants and replace them with loyalists under Project 2025. Yet, Republicans in Congress are unlikely to challenge Trump\u2019s legal overreach.Source: CBS NewsCFPB halts work after Trump appoints Bessent as acting headWhat Happened: Trump appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, immediately halting its work on regulations, investigations, and enforcement. Bessent ordered all CFPB staff to stop crafting rules, issuing penalties, or communicating with the public. The move aligns with Elon Musk\u2019s push to \u201cdelete\u201d the agency entirely. Why It Matters: The CFPB was created after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory financial practices. Trump\u2019s freeze leaves Americans vulnerable to banking fraud, junk fees, and financial scams. The agency was in the process of eliminating medical debt from credit reports and limiting overdraft fees, reforms that are now at risk. Banks and big corporations stand to benefit, while working-class Americans lose protections. This is a classic authoritarian power grab\u2014eliminating oversight, weakening accountability, and prioritizing corporate and oligarchy interests over the people.Source: The Washington PostSen. Jim Risch blocks Senate resolution in support of USAIDWhat Happened: Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) blocked a Senate resolution affirming USAID\u2019s national security role, which had the support of over 40 Democrats. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) pushed the resolution, arguing that Congress already appropriated funds for USAID, making Trump's dismantling of the agency an overreach. Risch, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to restructure USAID under Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Why It Matters: With Musk\u2019s backing, Trump is shutting down USAID despite Congress having already approved funding for its programs. This marks a major constitutional crisis, as the executive branch is openly defying legislative authority and consolidating control over foreign aid. The GOP\u2019s refusal to challenge Trump\u2019s actions confirms that Congress is no longer operating as an independent branch, but rather as a tool for Trump\u2019s agenda, allowing Musk\u2019s influence over government functions to grow unchecked. Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDOT to Prioritize High Birth and Marriage Rate AreasWhat Happened: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered DOT funding to favor communities with above-average birth and marriage rates, impacting major transit programs. The directive is effective immediately as U.S. birth rates hit a record low.Why It Matters: This shifts infrastructure funding based on ideology, potentially diverting resources from urban, single-parent, and minority communities. The move aligns with Trump\u2019s push to reshape federal funding around conservative \u201cfamily values\u201d and roll back DEI initiatives.Source: The HillFBI distributing questionnaire probing agents' work on Jan. 6 Capitol riot casesWhat Happened: The Trump regime targets 1000\u2019s of FBI agents involved in the January 6 insurrection investigations, distributing questionnaires probing their roles and compiling lists for potential firings. This follows a directive from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, a former Trump defense lawyer, ordering reviews of all agents who worked on Jan. 6 and Trump\u2019s classified documents case. Why It Matters: This is a blatant authoritarian purge, punishing law enforcement for investigating Trump\u2019s crimes. By targeting career FBI agents, Trump is using the Justice Department to erase history and rewrite the narrative, a classic dictator tactic. FBI leadership warns this threatens national security, while attorneys for agents argue it violates due process. The move echoes Russian-style political retribution, designed to instill fear and consolidate power.Source: CBS NewsMore than 1,000 EPA employees are told they could be dismissed immediatelyWhat Happened: The Trump regime has notified over 1,000 Environmental Protection Agency employees that they could be terminated immediately as part of a broader effort to downsize the federal government. Workers who haven\u2019t completed a year of service received an email last week warning them they were likely on a probationary period and could be fired without cause. However, some employees with over a year of service also received the email \u2018in error.\u2019Why It Matters: This mass firing is an unprecedented political purge aimed at gutting environmental protections and silencing federal employees who enforce climate policies Trump opposes. Targeting probationary employees\u2014who have little recourse to challenge termination\u2014allows Trump to reshape the EPA into a politically compliant agency. The move mirrors authoritarian tactics, where loyalty replaces expertise, and public institutions are weakened for corporate gain.Source: NBC NewsMarco Rubio empowers State Department official Pete Marocco to run USAIDTrump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: \u2018He\u2019s a destroyer\u2019What Happened: Marco Rubio appointed Trump ally Peter Marocco to oversee USAID\u2019s dismantling, advancing Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s push to consolidate foreign aid control. Marocco, forced out in Trump\u2019s first term after staff exposed his efforts to gut USAID, has now frozen assistance, cut jobs, and shut down key programs. He was also identified at the January 6 insurrection but never charged.Why It Matters: Marocco is not a disruptor\u2014he\u2019s a destroyer.\u2014according to former colleagues. His return signals an authoritarian power grab, erasing oversight and turning foreign aid into a political tool. USAID\u2019s collapse weakens U.S. global influence, opening doors for China and Russia.Source: NBC News, The GuardianTrump and Musk move to dismantle USAID, igniting battle with Democratic lawmakersWhat Happened: Trump and Elon Musk are dismantling USAID, shut down aid programs, slashed jobs, and blocked congressional Democrats from entering the agency\u2019s headquarters. The USAID plaque at HQ was removed, and its website went dark over the weekend. Musk boasted, \u201cSpent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared himself acting USAID administrator, despite the agency\u2019s six-decade independence.Why It Matters: This power grab eliminates oversight and weaponizes foreign aid. USAID\u2019s collapse endangers critical programs fighting famine, disease, and poverty, weakening U.S. global influence while handing strategic opportunities to China and Russia. Blocking lawmakers from entering USAID HQ is a classic authoritarian tactic, with Musk now wielding unchecked control over federal agencies.Source: AP News, The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsCBS Turns Over Documents in Trump\u2019s FCC Investigation of Kamala Harris InterviewWhat Happened: CBS News has submitted documents to the FCC as part of an investigation into a \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-VP Kamala Harris after Trump revived a complaint against the segment. Trump, who sued CBS for $10 billion, claims the interview was misleading and demanded an unedited transcript. The FCC, led by Trump-appointed Brendan Carr, is considering releasing the transcript publicly. This probe is retaliation against unfavorable media coverage and a warning to other legacy media outlets.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the FCC to intimidate media outlets, echoing tactics used by authoritarian regimes to silence critics. This threatens press freedom and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing the government to punish networks for unfavorable coverage. At the same time, Paramount is seeking FCC approval for a major merger, raising concerns about political pressure influencing corporate decisions.Source: ReutersNPR and PBS Targeted in MTG\u2019s House DOGE Subcommittee InvestigationWhat Happened: The House Oversight Committee\u2019s FAKE DOGE Subcommittee, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, targets NPR and PBS for alleged liberal bias. Greene has requested NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger testify in March. She cited NPR\u2019s refusal to report on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop in 2020 and PBS\u2019s coverage of Musk\u2019s alleged fascist salute at Trump\u2019s inauguration. The investigation will assess whether public broadcasting deserves federal funding.Why It Matters: This weaponization of congressional oversight using a FAKE agency mirrors authoritarian media crackdowns, where governments purge independent journalism under the guise of \u201cbias.\u201d Targeting public media funding threatens the free press and aims to silence critical reporting. This coordinated attack, in tandem with Trump\u2019s FCC probe into CBS, is part of a broader effort to reshape U.S. media into a state-controlled propaganda machine.Source: PoliticoJudge Blocks Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze\u2014AgainWhat Happened: A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has once again blocked Trump\u2019s spending freeze, ruling that nonprofits and aid organizations are still being denied allocated federal funds despite earlier court rulings against the freeze. Judge Loren AliKhan issued a temporary restraining order, stating the Trump regime was attempting to circumvent court rulings by informally continuing the freeze through agencies.Why It Matters: Despite two previous court orders, the Trump regime continues to defy legal authority. By withholding federal aid while falsely claiming the freeze was lifted, Trump\u2019s White House is manipulating public perception while breaking the law.Source: PoliticoU.S. Attorney Vows to Target Critics of Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE TakeoverWhat Happened: Interim D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin threatened legal action against anyone opposing Musk\u2019s unauthorized FAKE DOGE \u2018agency\u2019 in a letter posted to X, pledging DOJ support for Musk\u2019s operatives. His comments come as civil servants, protesters, and watchdog groups push back against DOGE\u2019s unlawful takeover of federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration. Reports indicate that DOGE employees have locked out career officials and used an illegal server to bypass federal oversight.Why It Matters: This is a blatant weaponization of the Justice Department to shield Musk\u2019s illegal power grab over federal institutions. By threatening legal action against those resisting an unconstitutional, tech-backed coup within the federal government, the Trump regime is using authoritarian tactics to silence critics. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s activities, including improper access to federal funds and personal data, likely violate multiple laws\u2014yet the DOJ is protecting them.Source: Ed Martin on X\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8DOGE\u2019s Access to Federal Data Is \u2018An Absolute Nightmare,\u2019 Legal Experts WarnWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s FAKE DOGE is seizing access to sensitive federal databases, including the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system and USAID records, sparking a legal and security crisis. Experts warn this violates the Privacy Act, cybersecurity laws, and financial regulations. Reports indicate career Treasury officials were locked out while unvetted DOGE hires gained access to critical payment networks.Why It Matters: This is one of the biggest security breaches that could expose taxpayer data, compromise national security, and cripple government payment systems. Legal scholars say Trump and Musk lack authority to override data protections and effectively hack into federal IT systems. The potential fallout includes data leaks, targeting of critics, payment disruptions for Social Security, Medicare, and tax refunds\u2014a catastrophic outcome for millions of Americans.Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Plans to Invoke Obscure 18th-Century Wartime Law for Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to bypass immigration courts and rapidly deport migrants alleged to be gang members. Originally designed for wartime use, the law was last invoked during World War II to justify internment camps. The regime is also expanding detention sites, including Guantanamo Bay and a military base in Colorado, to facilitate mass removals.Why It Matters: This dangerous use of wartime powers will enable large-scale deportations without due process, circumventing the immigration court system. This sets a dangerous precedent for executive overreach.Source: ReutersChristian Employee Group at State Department SuspendedWhat Happened: Grace, a Christian employee resource group at the U.S. State Department, was suddenly ordered to pause operations by Global Talent Management. The group, founded during Trump\u2019s first term, promotes religious diversity within the diplomatic corps. Leadership was instructed to halt all activities, with no clear explanation, but officials have promised \u201cadditional guidance\u201d in the future.Why It Matters: While Trump previously courted religious conservatives and infused government institutions with evangelical influence, his second term\u2019s focus on dismantling DEI initiatives may now extend to faith-based groups as well. Source: The GuardianElon Musk's DOGE Is Still Blocking HIV/AIDS Relief Exempted From Foreign Aid CutsWhat Happened: Despite Trump granting an emergency waiver for PEPFAR, Elon Musk\u2019s FAKE DOGE is still blocking critical HIV/AIDS aid. USAID workers have been locked out of their emails, preventing them from coordinating life-saving treatments in Zambia, Nigeria, Haiti, and Mozambique. Essential shipments of HIV medication, antiretrovirals, and prophylactics are now stranded because DOGE has shut down logistics operations and placed key personnel on leave.Why It Matters: This is a manufactured crisis that directly threatens lives. An estimated 300 newborns have contracted HIV unnecessarily due to treatment delays. Musk\u2019s takeover of USAID is not about efficiency\u2014it\u2019s about dismantling U.S. global health leadership. While Congress funded this aid, DOGE is overriding the law. The blockade on HIV/AIDS relief undermines decades of bipartisan progress and puts millions at risk.Source: WIRED\ud83d\udcf0 In White Supremacist NewsTrump Appoints Speechwriter Fired for Attending Conference with White Nationalists to Top State Department RoleWhat Happened: Darren Beattie, a former Trump speechwriter fired in 2018 for attending a White nationalist conference, has been appointed as Acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the State Department. Beattie, who founded Revolver News, has amplified January 6 conspiracy theories, racist rhetoric, and misogynistic attacks.Why It Matters: An election-denying conspiracy theorist is now in charge of U.S. foreign messaging, a hallmark of authoritarian regimes that rely on state propaganda and loyalty over professional expertise. Beattie\u2019s appointment threatens U.S. credibility in counterterrorism, diplomacy, and global security. His history of promoting extremist views and attacking the FBI raises grave national security concerns, as Trump continues dismantling institutions to consolidate power.Some of Beattie\u2019s Statements:\u201cCompetent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.\u201d\u201cShithole countries was the high-point of Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201d\u201cBLM must take a knee to MAGA.

The lawsuit claims the Treasury illegally shared confidential financial data with Musk\u2019s team, violating privacy laws protecting sensitive personal and financial information. This follows the resignation of David Lebryk, a top Treasury official, who reportedly clashed with Musk\u2019s allies over granting them access.Source: The HillDiversity Officers and Professors Sue to Block Trump\u2019s DEI OrdersWhat Happened: A coalition of professors, diversity officers, and worker advocates sued the Trump regime, challenging two executive orders targeting DEI programs in government, corporations, and academia.

Small traders lost money, while major investors and entities tied to Trump cashed in. His company, CIC Digital, is listed as a beneficiary of the fees. The ownership structure is opaque, with Delaware-registered firms like </span><em>Fight Fight Fight</em><span> and </span><em>Celebration Cards</em><span> receiving trading revenue.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>This is blatant financial corruption and self-dealing, with Trump using the presidency to enrich himself through a highly speculative crypto venture. His regime is simultaneously rewriting crypto regulations, creating a massive conflict of interest as he profits off policies he controls. Like dictators who use state power to funnel money into their own pockets, Trump is leveraging public office for personal gain, leaving everyday investors to suffer.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/trumps-meme-coin-made-nearly-100-million-trading-fees-small-traders-lost-money-2025-02-03/\" rel=\"\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>Senate Confirms Fossil Fuel CEO Chris Wright as Energy Secretary</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7senate-confirms-fossil-fuel-ceo-chris-wright-as-energy-secretary\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/156433619/senate-confirms-fossil-fuel-ceo-chris-wright-as-energy-secretary\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong><span>The Senate confirmed Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy, as Trump\u2019s new Energy Secretary in a 59-38 vote. Wright, a vocal opponent of climate policies, has pledged to advance Trump\u2019s \"drill, baby, drill\" agenda, prioritizing fossil fuel production while dismissing renewable energy initiatives. Wright will also serve on Trump\u2019s newly created National Energy Council, chaired by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to deregulate the energy industry and accelerate fossil fuel expansion.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>Trump is dismantling climate regulations and green energy policies, reversing Biden-era climate initiatives in favor of unchecked fossil fuel expansion.

U.S. Attorney Ed Martin threatened legal action against anyone opposing Musk\u2019s unauthorized FAKE DOGE \u2018agency\u2019 in a letter posted to X, pledging DOJ support for Musk\u2019s operatives. His comments come as civil servants, protesters, and watchdog groups push back against DOGE\u2019s unlawful takeover of federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration. Reports indicate that DOGE employees have locked out career officials and used an illegal server to bypass federal oversight.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>This is a blatant weaponization of the Justice Department to shield Musk\u2019s illegal power grab over federal institutions. By threatening legal action against those resisting an unconstitutional, tech-backed coup within the federal government, the Trump regime is using authoritarian tactics to silence critics. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s activities, including improper access to federal funds and personal data, likely violate multiple laws\u2014yet the DOJ is protecting them.</span></p><div

It will go into a future history of this extraordinary convulsion in American government- a revolution that failed, like so many before it, a hurricane that passed over the land but left so much damage behind it before it weakened and dissipated into vagrant breezes.  Trump is in his elder years and Musk is enjoying his fifteen minutes of reaching for earthly power- two baleful stars that will soon pass from our skies.  But despite them, humanity will continue its slow painful progress toward true civilization and this era forgotten save to the historians. Jam transit hyems.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-16

Small traders lost money, while major investors and entities tied to Trump cashed in. His company, CIC Digital, is listed as a beneficiary of the fees. The ownership structure is opaque, with Delaware-registered firms like <em>Fight Fight Fight</em> and <em>Celebration Cards</em> receiving trading revenue.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is blatant financial corruption and self-dealing, with Trump using the presidency to enrich himself through a highly speculative crypto venture. His regime is simultaneously rewriting crypto regulations, creating a massive conflict of interest as he profits off policies he controls. Like dictators who use state power to funnel money into their own pockets, Trump is leveraging public office for personal gain, leaving everyday investors to suffer.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/trumps-meme-coin-made-nearly-100-million-trading-fees-small-traders-lost-money-2025-02-03/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Senate Confirms Fossil Fuel CEO Chris Wright as Energy Secretary</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Senate confirmed Chris Wright, CEO of Liberty Energy, as Trump\\u2019s new Energy Secretary in a 59-38 vote. Wright, a vocal opponent of climate policies, has pledged to advance Trump\\u2019s \\\\\\\"drill, baby, drill\\\\\\\" agenda, prioritizing fossil fuel production while dismissing renewable energy initiatives. Wright will also serve on Trump\\u2019s newly created National Energy Council, chaired by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to deregulate the energy industry and accelerate fossil fuel expansion.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump is dismantling climate regulations and green energy policies, reversing Biden-era climate initiatives in favor of unchecked fossil fuel expansion. Wright's deep industry ties and lack of government experience raise concerns about conflicts of interest and corporate influence over U.S. energy policy. This appointment mirrors authoritarian strategies where industry executives seize government roles to serve corporate interests, weakening regulatory oversight and prioritizing profits over environmental and economic stability.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-confirms-chris-wright-energy-secretary/\\\\\\\">AP News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Commerce pick with crypto ties could sit on crypto task force</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Howard Lutnick, Trump\\u2019s nominee for Commerce Secretary, refuses to say whether he will recuse himself from the White House\\u2019s crypto task force, despite financial ties to Tether, a stablecoin firm linked to illicit finance scandals. Lutnick holds a $600M bond in Tether through Cantor Fitzgerald but declined to disclose details in response to Senate inquiries. He also pledged full support for Trump\\u2019s tariff-heavy trade agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Lutnick\\u2019s deep financial conflicts of interest raise ethical concerns as he would help craft crypto regulations while personally profiting from the industry. His Tether ties also pose national security risks, given its links to money laundering and illicit finance. His confirmation would further entrench Trump\\u2019s pro-crypto policies, which critics say are designed to enrich insiders and weaken oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/02/03/congress/lutnick-crypto-working-group-00202247\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Eric Trump Hypes Ethereum as Millions in ETH Flow to Coinbase</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Eric Trump promoted Ethereum (ETH) on social media, calling it a \\u201Cgreat time to buy,\\u201D before later deleting part of his tweet. Meanwhile, World Liberty Finance, a DeFi venture linked to the Trump family, moved millions in ETH to exchanges, sparking speculation of insider trading. The firm\\u2019s holdings dropped from $421M to $47M in ETH, following significant transfers to Coinbase, Lido, and Gnosis.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This further entrenches Trump\\u2019s personal financial ties to crypto as his regime rewrites regulations favoring the industry. The coordinated social media hype and large-scale asset movements mirror classic pump-and-dump schemes, highlighting ethics and market manipulation concerns. Furthermore, Trump will craft government policies to enrich himself and his family\\u2019s crypto ventures. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://cryptobriefing.com/eric-trump-ethereum-bullish-sentiment/\\\\\\\">CryptoSlate</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Ties Ukraine Military Aid to Rare Earth Deals</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump demanded Ukraine trade rare earth elements and other critical minerals in exchange for continued U.S. military aid in its war against Russia\\u2019s genocidal invasion. This corrupt move will attempt to secure U.S. access to valuable resources.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This turns foreign policy and military aid into a transactional deal and further shows U.S. has no plans on protecting democracies. Also, a large percentage of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is actually spent inside the U.S. on weapons production, making Trump\\u2019s proposal an opportunistic move. The push mirrors Trump\\u2019s past exploitation of foreign conflicts for financial gain, signaling corruption and coercion.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5124152-trump-rare-earth-elements-deal-ukraine-military-aid/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Moves to Dismantle the Department of Education</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump is preparing to sign an executive order directing the Education Secretary to draft a plan to dismantle the federal Department of Education, fulfilling a long-standing conservative goal. The order will call for Congress to pass legislation shutting it down, but an immediate closure is unlikely. Trump\\u2019s nominee for Education Secretary, Linda McMahon, has not yet been confirmed, and a Senate vote to eliminate the department would likely fail without a two-thirds majority. Meanwhile, dozens of department employees have already been placed on administrative leave.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Eliminating the Department of Education would gut federal oversight of public schools, shifting control to the states and leaving low-income students without critical support. It would also jeopardize federal funding for K-12 education, including programs addressing achievement gaps and student loan protections. This move mirrors authoritarian tactics of weakening institutions to consolidate power and eliminate regulatory oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-order-dismantle-education-department-works-sources/story?id=118418280\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Key State Department Programs \\u2018Wiped Out\\u2019 After Dozens of Contractors Fired</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has fired around 60 contractors of contractors at the State Department\\u2019s <strong>Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL)</strong>, gutting key programs advancing democracy and human rights worldwide. This follows stop-work orders on all foreign-aid contracts, part of Trump\\u2019s 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed he is now acting head of USAID, where senior leadership has been ousted, employees were blocked from entering headquarters, and the website has gone offline. The cuts are being orchestrated by Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee reportedly seen at the January 6 Capitol insurrection.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a direct attack on U.S. democracy promotion, benefiting authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. DRL has been essential in supporting pro-democracy movements, combating human rights abuses, and strengthening civil society abroad, and further shows America\\u2019s tilt into authoritarianism. Also, with USAID also crippled, Trump is effectively erasing the U.S. role in global democratic leadership, paving the way for autocrats to expand their influence.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/state-department-contractors-fired\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>GOP Officials Say Trump\\u2019s Federal Worker Buyout Program Is Illegal</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump\\u2019s regime offered federal workers buyouts through September, despite Congress only funding the government until mid-March. GOP officials warn this violates the Anti-Deficiency Act, which bars unauthorized spending. The estimated cost could reach $50 billion, sparking legal concerns.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a purge of federal workers, bypassing legal budget limits to clear out career civil servants and replace them with loyalists under Project 2025. Yet, Republicans in Congress are unlikely to challenge Trump\\u2019s legal overreach.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-officials-say-trump-federal-workers-buyout-program-illegal/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>CFPB halts work after Trump appoints Bessent as acting head</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, immediately halting its work on regulations, investigations, and enforcement. Bessent ordered all CFPB staff to stop crafting rules, issuing penalties, or communicating with the public. The move aligns with Elon Musk\\u2019s push to \\u201Cdelete\\u201D the agency entirely. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The CFPB was created after the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory financial practices. Trump\\u2019s freeze leaves Americans vulnerable to banking fraud, junk fees, and financial scams. The agency was in the process of eliminating medical debt from credit reports and limiting overdraft fees, reforms that are now at risk. Banks and big corporations stand to benefit, while working-class Americans lose protections. This is a classic authoritarian power grab\\u2014eliminating oversight, weakening accountability, and prioritizing corporate and oligarchy interests over the people.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/03/trump-cfpb-bessent-halt/?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_news_alert_revere&amp;location=alert\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Sen. Jim Risch <strong>blocks Senate resolution in support of USAID</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Sen. <strong>Jim Risch (R-Idaho)</strong> blocked a Senate resolution affirming USAID\\u2019s national security role, which had the support of over 40 Democrats. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) pushed the resolution, arguing that Congress already appropriated funds for USAID, making Trump's dismantling of the agency an overreach. Risch, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, defended Trump and Elon Musk\\u2019s efforts to restructure USAID under Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With Musk\\u2019s backing, Trump is shutting down USAID despite Congress having already approved funding for its programs. This marks a major constitutional crisis, as the executive branch is openly defying legislative authority and consolidating control over foreign aid. The GOP\\u2019s refusal to challenge Trump\\u2019s actions confirms that Congress is no longer operating as an independent branch, but rather as a tool for Trump\\u2019s agenda, allowing Musk\\u2019s influence over government functions to grow unchecked. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5124652-sen-jim-risch-blocks-senate-resolution-usaid/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>DOT to Prioritize High Birth and Marriage Rate Areas</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered DOT funding to favor communities with above-average birth and marriage rates, impacting major transit programs. The directive is effective immediately as U.S. birth rates hit a record low.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This shifts infrastructure funding based on ideology, potentially diverting resources from urban, single-parent, and minority communities. The move aligns with Trump\\u2019s push to reshape federal funding around conservative \\u201Cfamily values\\u201D and roll back DEI initiatives.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5124322-duffy-dot-transportation-trump-birth-rate/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>FBI distributing questionnaire probing agents' work on Jan. 6 Capitol riot cases</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Trump regime targets 1000\\u2019s of FBI agents involved in the January 6 insurrection investigations, distributing questionnaires probing their roles and compiling lists for potential firings. This follows a directive from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, a former Trump defense lawyer, ordering reviews of all agents who worked on Jan. 6 and Trump\\u2019s classified documents case. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a blatant authoritarian purge, punishing law enforcement for investigating Trump\\u2019s crimes. By targeting career FBI agents, Trump is using the Justice Department to erase history and rewrite the narrative, a classic dictator tactic. FBI leadership warns this threatens national security, while attorneys for agents argue it violates due process. The move echoes Russian-style political retribution, designed to instill fear and consolidate power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-questionnaire-jan-6-agents/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h3>More than 1,000 EPA employees are told they could be dismissed immediately</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Trump regime has notified over 1,000 Environmental Protection Agency employees that they could be terminated immediately as part of a broader effort to downsize the federal government. Workers who haven\\u2019t completed a year of service received an email last week warning them they were likely on a probationary period and could be fired without cause. However, some employees with over a year of service also received the email \\u2018in error.\\u2019</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This mass firing is an unprecedented political purge aimed at gutting environmental protections and silencing federal employees who enforce climate policies Trump opposes. Targeting probationary employees\\u2014who have little recourse to challenge termination\\u2014allows Trump to reshape the EPA into a politically compliant agency. The move mirrors authoritarian tactics, where loyalty replaces expertise, and public institutions are weakened for corporate gain.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/epa-employees-told-dismissed-immediately-rcna190474\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Marco Rubio empowers State Department official Pete Marocco to run USAID</h3><p><strong>Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: \\u2018He\\u2019s a destroyer\\u2019</strong></p><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Marco Rubio appointed Trump ally Peter Marocco to oversee USAID\\u2019s dismantling, advancing Trump and Elon Musk\\u2019s push to consolidate foreign aid control. Marocco, forced out in Trump\\u2019s first term after staff exposed his efforts to gut USAID, has now frozen assistance, cut jobs, and shut down key programs.

Musk boasted, \\u201CSpent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.\\u201D Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared himself acting USAID administrator, despite the agency\\u2019s six-decade independence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This power grab eliminates oversight and weaponizes foreign aid.

Trump, who sued CBS for $10 billion, claims the interview was misleading and demanded an unedited transcript. The FCC, led by Trump-appointed Brendan Carr, is considering releasing the transcript publicly. This probe is retaliation against unfavorable media coverage and a warning to other legacy media outlets.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump is weaponizing the FCC to intimidate media outlets, echoing tactics used by authoritarian regimes to silence critics. This threatens press freedom and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing the government to punish networks for unfavorable coverage.

She cited NPR\\u2019s refusal to report on Hunter Biden\\u2019s laptop in 2020 and PBS\\u2019s coverage of Musk\\u2019s alleged fascist salute at Trump\\u2019s inauguration.

Judge Loren AliKhan issued a temporary restraining order, stating the Trump regime was attempting to circumvent court rulings by informally continuing the freeze through agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Despite two previous court orders, the Trump regime continues to defy legal authority.

His comments come as civil servants, protesters, and watchdog groups push back against DOGE\\u2019s unlawful takeover of federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, and the General Services Administration. Reports indicate that DOGE employees have locked out career officials and used an illegal server to bypass federal oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a blatant weaponization of the Justice Department to shield Musk\\u2019s illegal power grab over federal institutions. By threatening legal action against those resisting an unconstitutional, tech-backed coup within the federal government, the Trump regime is using authoritarian tactics to silence critics.

The regime is also expanding detention sites, including Guantanamo Bay and a military base in Colorado, to facilitate mass removals.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This dangerous use of wartime powers will enable large-scale deportations without due process, circumventing the immigration court system.

USAID workers have been locked out of their emails, preventing them from coordinating life-saving treatments in Zambia, Nigeria, Haiti, and Mozambique. Essential shipments of HIV medication, antiretrovirals, and prophylactics are now stranded because DOGE has shut down logistics operations and placed key personnel on leave.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a manufactured crisis that directly threatens lives.
