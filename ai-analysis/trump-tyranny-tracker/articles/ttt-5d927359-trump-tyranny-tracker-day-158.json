This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=headerDon\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EDT.Note: We will not be Live on Monday, 6/30.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsSEC, Ripple wants to settle crypto lawsuit, but US judge rebuffs themWhat Happened: A federal judge rejected a joint effort by Ripple Labs and the SEC to settle their long-running crypto lawsuit with a reduced $50 million fine. Judge Analisa Torres rebuked both parties for attempting to bypass a permanent injunction she had issued after finding Ripple sold $728 million in XRP tokens as unregistered securities to institutional investors.Why It Matters: The ruling blocks a rare mutual resolution and reaffirms the court\u2019s authority. It\u2019s a blow to Ripple, a major Trump donor, which had hoped political influence would end the case. The judge saw through it\u2014sending a clear message against favoritism and corruption.Source: ReutersTrumps drop \u2018Made in the USA\u2019 label for new phone and a debate ensues: How to define \u2018made\u2019?What Happened: The Trump family quietly swapped \u201cMade in the USA\u201d labels on its new T-1 phone with vague phrases like \u201cProudly American\u201d after concerns it violated FTC origin rules. Experts say a truly U.S.-made phone is nearly impossible due to global supply chains.Why It Matters: The move exposes another Trump family con\u2014claiming it's American-made for their MAGA base while it\u2019s made in China, just like their hats, Bibles, and more. It also reveals a glaring conflict of interest: Trump is regulating rivals while cashing in on his tech venture.Source: Associated PressFCC chief had no discussions with White House on Trump Mobile phoneWhat Happened: FCC Chair Brendan Carr said he had no discussions with the White House about the launch of Trump Mobile, the new MAGA-branded phone and mobile service. Carr claimed he learned of the project through press reports and \u201cpromised\u201d standard regulatory handling.Why It Matters: Carr\u2019s denial raises alarms as Trump uses federal agencies to boost his business. With Trump overseeing the FCC while targeting tech rivals, watchdogs warn that the line between governance and profiteering is vanishing. Carr has already shown his subservience by going after media organizations at Trump\u2019s command.Source: ReutersElizabeth Warren presses oil companies on tax break lobbying for Senate billWhat Happened: Elizabeth Warren and Senate Democrats are demanding answers from ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv over lobbying for a fossil fuel tax loophole buried in Trump\u2019s new \u201creconciliation\u201d bill. The provision would slash or eliminate federal taxes for major oil firms by exempting drilling costs from the corporate minimum tax.Why It Matters: As Republicans gut clean energy programs, this backroom deal would reward Big Oil with billions in giveaways while raising utility bills and killing green jobs. It\u2019s a windfall for fossil fuel giants, paid for by working Americans.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s latest rejection of intelligence assessments reflects a long distrust of spy agenciesWhat Happened: Trump is rejecting intelligence assessments that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was only modestly disrupted by recent U.S. airstrikes, insisting it was \u201ccompletely obliterated.\u201d Trump\u2019s actions mirror his first term, when he openly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing intelligence for political gain\u2014discarding facts, silencing analysts, and demanding loyalty over truth. This is a dangerous shift that puts propaganda above national security amid rising global threats.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsICE Is Using a New Facial Recognition App to Identify People, Leaked Emails ShowWhat Happened: ICE is using a new facial recognition app called Mobile Fortify to identify people on the street using facial images or fingerprints captured by agents' smartphones. The app taps into biometric systems originally meant for U.S. border entry and exit, repurposing them for domestic field operations\u2014without Congressional authorization or oversight.Why It Matters: This marks another escalation in Trump\u2019s surveillance regime. It paves the way for mass misidentification, wrongful arrests, and unchecked government spying\u2014first targeting immigrants, then expanding to all Americans.Source: 404 MediaAirline-Owned Data Broker Selling Your Flight Info to DHS Finally Registers as a Data BrokerWhat Happened: ARC, a data broker owned by major airlines like Delta and United, has been selling travelers' flight records to U.S. government agencies\u2014including ICE and CBP\u2014without registering as required by California law. After being contacted by Senator Ron Wyden\u2019s office, ARC quietly registered with the state.Why It Matters: ARC has secretly sold over a billion sensitive travel records to the government while hiding its role. This revelation exposes how deeply airline data is embedded in surveillance networks\u2014and how little oversight exists. Without state action, Americans\u2019 travel privacy would remain entirely unprotected.Source: 404 MediaState Department gears up for imminent layoffs, despite federal judge\u2019s orderWhat Happened: The State Department is set to send nearly 1,900 layoff notices, despite a court injunction blocking Trump\u2019s order to purge the federal workforce. Most targets are domestic staff and Foreign Service officers stuck stateside due to a personnel freeze.Why It Matters: This would defy a federal court and gut U.S. diplomacy. Trump is purging career diplomats, crippling global operations, and politicizing the Foreign Service\u2014undermining national security for decades to come.Source: Federal News NetworkJustice Dept. Opens Inquiry Into University of California Hiring PracticesWhat Happened: The DOJ opened a civil rights investigation into the University of California\u2019s 2030 diversity hiring plan, alleging it may involve \u201cillegal\u201d racial quotas. This comes one day after the Trump officials attacked California\u2019s transgender sports policy.Why It Matters: It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s escalating war on diversity and universities. By targeting public education systems like UC, the regime aims to force universities to adopt its anti-inclusion ideology.Source: New York TimesDOJ Coordinated with Texas AG to Kill Texas Dream Act, Trump Official SaysWhat Happened: A top Trump DOJ official admitted that the DOJ coordinated with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to kill the state\u2019s 24-year-old Dream Act in just six hours. The DOJ filed a lawsuit, Paxton\u2019s office didn\u2019t defend the law, and a judge issued a consent judgment the same day. Why It Matters: This is a textbook abuse of power. DOJ is weaponizing the courts to dismantle immigrant protections through fake lawsuits and one-party settlements\u2014erasing laws without debate, defense, or accountability.Source: NBC NewsHouse Panel Subpoenas Harvard in Tuition-Pricing InquiryWhat Happened: Rep. Jim Jordan\u2019s House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Harvard over its tuition and financial aid policies, claiming the university is stonewalling an antitrust probe into Ivy League price coordination. Harvard called the subpoena \u201cunwarranted,\u201d noting it has already handed over thousands of pages.Why It Matters: More political retribution. Trump is weaponizing Congress to punish Harvard for defying his anti-academic crusade, escalating a broader assault on elite institutions seen as ideological threats.Source: New York TimesTrump Justice Dept. Pressuring University of Virginia President to ResignWhat Happened: DOJ is pressuring the University of Virginia to oust President James E. Ryan as part of a civil rights probe into its diversity programs. Officials accuse Ryan of failing to dismantle DEI efforts and misrepresenting compliance, threatening to withhold federal funds unless he steps down.Why It Matters: This is ideological cleansing disguised as enforcement. Trump is using the DOJ to purge public universities of diversity-supporting leaders, demanding political obedience in exchange for funding. Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsMediator Proposes $20 Million Settlement in Trump\u2019s CBS SuitWhat Happened: A mediator suggested Paramount settle Trump\u2019s $20 billion lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Kamala Harris for $20 million\u2014most of which would go to Trump\u2019s foundation and legal fees. Trump claims CBS deceptively edited the segment to sway the election. Negotiations are ongoing.Why It Matters: Trump is monetizing lawsuits against the press, using legal threats to extract payouts that benefit his political machine. This blurs the line between justice and extortion, chilling press freedom and normalizing financial settlements as tools of political coercion.Source: Wall Street JournalFormer Supreme Court Justice Kennedy Says \u2018Democracy Is at Risk\u2019What Happened: Retired Justice Anthony Kennedy warned that political extremism and attacks on judges are threatening U.S. democracy. Without naming Trump, he criticized divisive rhetoric and identity-based politics as harmful to civil discourse and the judiciary\u2019s integrity.Why It Matters: A Reagan-appointed justice sounding the alarm shows how dire things are. Trump\u2019s attacks on the courts are eroding the rule of law, turning judges into targets, and undermining a key pillar of democracy just as authoritarianism gains ground.Source: PoliticoTrump Threatens to Sue The Times and CNN Over Iran ReportingWhat Happened: Trump threatened to sue The New York Times and CNN for reporting that contradicted his claims about destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program. His lawyer demanded retractions, calling the stories \u201cdefamatory,\u201d but both outlets stood by their reporting.Why It Matters: This is a classic authoritarian move to silence the press. Trump is using legal threats to suppress truth and enforce loyalty\u2014rewriting facts to fit his narrative and punishing those who refuse to comply.Source: New York TimesRepublicans Call for Zohran Mamdani\u2019s Deportation After NYC Mayoral WinWhat Happened: After Zohran Mamdani beat Andrew Cuomo in the NYC mayoral primary, some Republicans called for his citizenship to be revoked and demanded his deportation. Trump allies labeled him a \u201ccommunist\u201d and used extremist rhetoric to justify the attack.Why It Matters: The fact that Republicans are targeting naturalized citizens for their beliefs is chilling. Threats of denaturalization are being weaponized to silence dissent, while conditioning Americans to accept the idea that the government can strip citizenship from those who disagree.Source: The Independent\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsWhite House wants deep cut in US funding for war crimes investigations, sources sayWhat Happened: The White House has moved to terminate U.S. funding for nearly two dozen war crimes and justice programs worldwide, including efforts documenting Russian atrocities in Ukraine. The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s recommendation targets initiatives in Ukraine, Myanmar, Syria, Sudan, and elsewhere.Why It Matters: This is a sharp departure from decades of bipartisan support for global justice. Gutting these programs will derail prosecutions of Russian war crimes and genocide, and reiterates Trump\u2019s retreat from human rights as a U.S. foreign policy priority.Source: ReutersPurple Heart Army Veteran Self-Deports After 50 Years in U.S.What Happened: Sae Joon Park, a 55-year-old South Korean-born Army veteran and Purple Heart recipient, left the U.S. under threat of deportation by ICE. Despite decades of legal residency, service in Panama, and raising a family in Hawaii, past drug convictions barred him from citizenship and made him a Trump target.Why It Matters: A combat-wounded veteran who served honorably was forced out of the country he defended, underscoring the cruelty and reach of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, even against America\u2019s military members.Source: The GuardianUS Citizen Detained in ICE Raid, Family Calls It a \u2018Kidnapping\u2019What Happened: Andrea Velez, a 32-year-old US citizen, was violently detained by ICE agents during an immigration raid in Los Angeles. Witnesses say she was never asked for ID, and her family described the arrest as racially motivated. She was held incommunicado for over a day before attorneys located her.Why It Matters: The Trump regime is blurring the line between citizen and non-citizen, disappearing people based on skin color, and enabling unlawful detentions by federal agents with no accountability. Constitutional protections are being shredded in broad daylight.Source: The GuardianSupreme Court sides with South Carolina in effort to cut Planned Parenthood fundingWhat Happened: In a 6\u20133 ruling, the Supreme Court sided with South Carolina\u2019s effort to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds, arguing that Medicaid recipients cannot sue to enforce their right to choose their provider. The decision overturns a lower court ruling and will embolden other GOP-led states to cut off funding for the reproductive health provider.Why It Matters: This ruling guts a key legal safeguard for low-income patients and opens the door to nationwide defunding of Planned Parenthood. With over 200 clinics at risk, access to cancer screenings, birth control, and STI treatment for millions is now under threat.Source: USA Today\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchUS State Department told to end nearly all its overseas pro-democracy programsWhat Happened: Nearly all U.S. State Department democracy and human rights programs\u2014totaling $1.3 billion\u2014are being eliminated under a Trump directive. Only two grants will survive as the DRL bureau faces a mass purge. A senior adviser also tried funneling funds to white nationalist causes like Afrikaner resettlement and to support the legal defense of pro-Kremlin French politician Le Pen.Why It Matters: This is a full-scale attack on U.S. human rights leadership. Trump is gutting pro-democracy aid, empowering dictators, abandoning dissidents, and redirecting foreign policy to boost global far-right movements.Source: The GuardianAs Political Violence Surges, Trump Shuts Down a Top Prevention ProgramWhat Happened: Trump has shut down DHS\u2019s Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), purging staff and halting grants that supported states in stopping terrorism and targeted violence. This comes amid a surge in political violence, including an ISIS-inspired massacre and antisemitic killings.Why It Matters: CP3 was a vital tool to prevent mass violence through mental health and community support. Dismantling it cripples proven, nonpartisan prevention efforts\u2014just as MAGA extremism and foreign threats grow\u2014replacing smart policy with dangerous indifference.Source: Mother JonesSenators Demand Investigation Into Canceled VA Contracts, Citing \u201cDamning Reporting From ProPublica\u201dWhat Happened: Senators Blumenthal and King are calling for a federal probe after nearly 600 VA contracts were abruptly canceled by Trump officials. A ProPublica report revealed the cuts were based on a flawed AI tool from unauthorized DOGE that labeled contracts \u201cmunchable.\u201d Terminated services include cancer treatment and blood analysis.Why It Matters: Veterans are paying the price for Trump\u2019s data-driven purge. Life-saving care was cut by untested algorithms pushed by unqualified  and unvetted staff from an unauthorized agency, and will have deadly consequences for those who served.Source: ProPublicaCancer experts alarmed over \u2018gut-wrenching\u2019 Trump plan to cut research spending by billionsWhat Happened: Trump is slashing the National Cancer Institute\u2019s budget by 37%, cutting $2.7 billion and canceling over $180 million in grants. Hundreds have already been purged, and key programs for prevention, trials, and community research are being dismantled.Why It Matters: These cuts will cost lives. Scientists warn that the damage will stall breakthroughs, drive talent away, and deny patients critical treatments. It\u2019s another attack on science, medicine, and every family fighting cancer.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchWhy Iran\u2019s Unaccounted for Uranium Worries Nuclear ExpertsWhat Happened: Iran moved 409 kilograms of near-weapons-grade uranium to a secret site just before inspections halted. The IAEA has lost visibility on the stockpile, and new Iranian laws have suspended cooperation with nuclear monitors.Why It Matters: Iran could now fast-track a nuclear weapon without detection. With oversight frozen and key sites bombed, the missing uranium raises fears of a secret breakout\u2014risking a regional war with no deal to stop it. Meanwhile, Trump falsely claims he \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s program and is politicizing intelligence to hide the failure.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchWhy Ukraine Fell Down the Agenda at the NATO SummitWhat Happened: At this year\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Ukraine was sidelined as leaders focused on appeasing Trump. The official declaration omitted any reference to Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership, and Trump offered no new aid or clear plan. Meanwhile, Russia continues escalating attacks against civilians, while U.S. military support has stalled since Trump\u2019s return to office.Why It Matters: Ukraine\u2019s fight for survival is being sacrificed to placate Trump\u2019s agenda and ego. The summit\u2019s silence signals a dangerous shift away from defending democracy and toward enabling authoritarianism. With no new aid and no path to NATO, Ukraine is being abandoned in its darkest hour while Trump continues to provide cover for Russia.Source: New York TimesTired of military aid delays, Ukraine has designed its own ballistic missile \u2014 and it\u2019s already in mass-productionWhat Happened: Ukraine has launched mass production of its Sapsan ballistic missile after successful tests, marking a major leap toward military self-reliance. With a 480+ kg warhead and 300+ km range, Sapsan fills the gap left by dwindling Western supplies and blocked U.S. aid.Why It Matters: Ukraine is no longer waiting for help. As Trump stalls aid and provides cover to Russia while it escalates, Kyiv is trying to arm itself, becoming the first European country since the Cold War to produce conventional ballistic missiles. Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsLabor Market Softens as Unemployment Rolls GrowWhat Happened: Weekly jobless claims dipped to 236,000, but continuing claims hit a 3.5-year high at 1.97 million\u2014signaling weaker hiring. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs are fueling business uncertainty, stalling workforce growth.Why It Matters: With more workers stuck on unemployment and trade disruptions weighing on spending, the economy is losing steam. Source: ReutersChina Is Still Choking Exports of Rare Earths Despite Pact With U.S.What Happened: Weeks after pledging to ease restrictions, China is still blocking rare-earth magnet exports critical to U.S. industry. Companies face delays, denials, and demands for sensitive data\u2014despite Trump\u2019s claim China would \u201cfully supply\u201d the materials. Exports have plunged, forcing shutdowns at factories like Ford\u2019s.Why It Matters: China is choking off vital supplies while pretending to negotiate. The move shows how easily Beijing can weaponize trade\u2014and how hollow Trump\u2019s so-called deals really are. U.S. supply chains remain dangerously exposed.Source: Wall Street JournalUS goods trade deficit widens in May as exports fallWhat Happened: The U.S. goods trade deficit jumped 11.1% in May to $96.6 billion as exports dropped sharply by $9.7 billion. Imports remained mostly flat. The earlier import surge\u2014driven by companies racing to beat Trump\u2019s new tariffs\u2014had already pushed the Q1 trade gap to record levels.Why It Matters: The widening deficit reflects weakening global demand for U.S. goods and lingering trade distortions from Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy. While trade may temporarily boost GDP in Q2, economists warn it\u2019s not a sign of lasting economic strength.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Federal judge orders US Labor Department to keep Job Corps running during lawsuitWhat Happened: A federal judge issued an injunction preventing the Department of Labor from halting the Job Corps program, a long-standing training initiative for low-income youth, until a lawsuit is resolved.

Given his proclamation that he not only rules the country but he also rules the world, he is now exporting his wielding of extortion and blackmail and deploying it  into not only the local politics of Israel but into their criminal justice system.</span></p><p><span>One hand washes the other. Netanyahu handed  Trump on a silver platter not merely the opportunity to bask in glory by having our military perform the coup de grace on Iran\u2019s nuclear program but to extricate himself, in doing so, from his blatantly humiliating stunt to hold a military parade for his birthday.</span></p><p><span>So this is now payback time for Trump to return the favor - which is precisely what Trump is doing by threatening Israel with the consequences of his wrath unless they drop the corruption charges against Netanyahu.</span></p><p><span>The world will now have the opportunity to witness to what extent Israel may shine as heroes in their struggle against Iran and Hamas but display themselves as cowardly victims in submitting to the will of Donald J. Trump.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-16

Judge Analisa Torres rebuked both parties for attempting to bypass a permanent injunction she had issued after finding Ripple sold $728 million in XRP tokens as unregistered securities to institutional investors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The ruling blocks a rare mutual resolution and reaffirms the court\\u2019s authority. It\\u2019s a blow to Ripple, a major Trump donor, which had hoped political influence would end the case. The judge saw through it\\u2014sending a clear message against favoritism and corruption.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/sec-ripple-wants-settle-crypto-lawsuit-us-judge-rebuffs-them-2025-06-26/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trumps drop \\u2018Made in the USA\\u2019 label for new phone and a debate ensues: How to define \\u2018made\\u2019?</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Trump family quietly swapped \\u201CMade in the USA\\u201D labels on its new T-1 phone with vague phrases like \\u201CProudly American\\u201D after concerns it violated FTC origin rules. Experts say a truly U.S.-made phone is nearly impossible due to global supply chains.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move exposes another Trump family con\\u2014claiming it's American-made for their MAGA base while it\\u2019s made in China, just like their hats, Bibles, and more. It also reveals a glaring conflict of interest: Trump is regulating rivals while cashing in on his tech venture.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cell-phone-mobile-made-america-3e03af70b6a9b161b522cc8055f1b25b\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>FCC chief had no discussions with White House on Trump Mobile phone</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FCC Chair Brendan Carr said he had no discussions with the White House about the launch of Trump Mobile, the new MAGA-branded phone and mobile service. Carr claimed he learned of the project through press reports and \\u201Cpromised\\u201D standard regulatory handling.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Carr\\u2019s denial raises alarms as Trump uses federal agencies to boost his business. With Trump overseeing the FCC while targeting tech rivals, watchdogs warn that the line between governance and profiteering is vanishing. Carr has already shown his subservience by going after media organizations at Trump\\u2019s command.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/fcc-chief-had-no-discussions-with-white-house-trump-mobile-phone-2025-06-26/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Elizabeth Warren presses oil companies on tax break lobbying for Senate bill</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Elizabeth Warren and Senate Democrats are demanding answers from ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv over lobbying for a fossil fuel tax loophole buried in Trump\\u2019s new \\u201Creconciliation\\u201D bill. The provision would slash or eliminate federal taxes for major oil firms by exempting drilling costs from the corporate minimum tax.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As Republicans gut clean energy programs, this backroom deal would reward Big Oil with billions in giveaways while raising utility bills and killing green jobs. It\\u2019s a windfall for fossil fuel giants, paid for by working Americans.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/elizabeth-warren-oil-companies-tax-break-lobbying\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump\\u2019s latest rejection of intelligence assessments reflects a long distrust of spy agencies</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is rejecting intelligence assessments that Iran\\u2019s nuclear program was only modestly disrupted by recent U.S. airstrikes, insisting it was \\u201Ccompletely obliterated.\\u201D Trump\\u2019s actions mirror his first term, when he openly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues weaponizing intelligence for political gain\\u2014discarding facts, silencing analysts, and demanding loyalty over truth.

The app taps into biometric systems originally meant for U.S. border entry and exit, repurposing them for domestic field operations\\u2014without Congressional authorization or oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks another escalation in Trump\\u2019s surveillance regime. It paves the way for mass misidentification, wrongful arrests, and unchecked government spying\\u2014first targeting immigrants, then expanding to all Americans.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.404media.co/ice-is-using-a-new-facial-recognition-app-to-identify-people-leaked-emails-show/\\\\\\\">404 Media</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Airline-Owned Data Broker Selling Your Flight Info to DHS Finally Registers as a Data Broker</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ARC, a data broker owned by major airlines like Delta and United, has been selling travelers' flight records to U.S. government agencies\\u2014including ICE and CBP\\u2014without registering as required by California law. After being contacted by Senator Ron Wyden\\u2019s office, ARC quietly registered with the state.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> ARC has secretly sold over a billion sensitive travel records to the government while hiding its role. This revelation exposes how deeply airline data is embedded in surveillance networks\\u2014and how little oversight exists.

Most targets are domestic staff and Foreign Service officers stuck stateside due to a personnel freeze.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would defy a federal court and gut U.S. diplomacy.

This comes one day after the Trump officials attacked California\\u2019s transgender sports policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> It\\u2019s part of Trump\\u2019s escalating war on diversity and universities.
