This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct6eN0zD4V-eFBAJgR2zCiIIo4ycjZysrCYixcdDpNfm1c1Q/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsConsumer agency sidelines top fair lending official, sources sayWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s CFPB placed its top fair lending official on leave, days after he warned that mass purges would cripple anti-discrimination oversight. The move follows the early end of a Bank of America oversight deal and efforts to reverse a racial bias settlement.Why It Matters: Trump continues to hollow out consumer protections, sideline watchdogs, and weaken enforcement against lending discrimination\u2014at the expense of Americans.Source: ReutersFour senators bought AI stock while Senate considered deregulating AIWhat Happened: 4 U.S. senators or their families bought AI-related stocks\u2014Google, Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon\u2014while the Senate weighed AI deregulation. Two bought Google shares the same day as a key Senate hearing with AI executives; three sit on the Commerce Committee.Why It Matters: These trades highlight how lawmakers continue to profit while shaping policy. Investing in firms lobbying against AI rules raises serious ethical red flags. Without a ban on congressional stock trading, public trust will keep eroding.Source: CREWTrump weighs new coal sales from public lands in Montana and WyomingWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Interior Department is reopening over 2,600 square miles of federal land in Montana and Wyoming for coal mining, undoing Biden-era climate policies. His new budget law slashes royalty rates and mandates expanded leasing in the Powder River Basin.Why It Matters: This is a massive fossil fuel giveaway that puts profits over climate and public health. As the world moves away from coal, Trump is reversing clean energy progress and handing public lands to industry\u2014fueling the very disasters scientists are warning against.Source: Associated PressTrump Media seeks SEC approval for blue-chip crypto ETFWhat Happened: Trump Media & Technology Group has filed with the SEC to launch a cryptocurrency ETF that would invest in major tokens like bitcoin, ether, solana, and ripple. The move comes as Trump intensifies his push into digital assets.Why It Matters: Trump is using his media company to cash in on crypto while dismantling safeguards meant to protect investors. It\u2019s blatant corruption\u2014blurring the line between public office and private gain as he continues using government power as a tool for personal profit.Source: ReutersEx-NYPD chiefs allege corruption and cronyism in lawsuits against Mayor Adams and his alliesWhat Happened: Four ex-NYPD officials, including former Chief of Detectives James Essig, filed lawsuits accusing Mayor Eric Adams and allies of selling police promotions for up to $15,000. Whistleblowers say they were punished for speaking out. Why It Matters: A reminder that federal prosecutors dropped a criminal case against Adams earlier this year, while Trump continues to shield him from accountability.Source: Associated PressBondi made changes to DOJ policy. Her former client Pfizer might have benefitedWhat Happened: Pam Bondi dismantled DOJ enforcement of foreign corruption laws shortly after taking office\u2014just as Pfizer, her former client, stopped disclosing ongoing DOJ probes. Bondi previously earned over $200K from a firm representing Pfizer. Days into her tenure, Trump signed an order pausing new corruption cases, and several\u2014including Pfizer\u2019s\u2014were dropped or stalled.Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s actions directly benefited a former client while weakening global anti-bribery enforcement. It\u2019s a glaring conflict of interest that raises serious concerns about influence peddling at the highest levels of justice.Source: Miami Herald\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsUS supreme court clears way for Trump officials to resume mass government firingsWhat Happened: The Supreme Court lifted a lower court freeze on Trump\u2019s mass federal purges, allowing him to move forward with cutting hundreds of thousands of civil service jobs. The ruling backs Trump\u2019s executive order tied to Project 2025, his plan to remake the federal government and centralize control.Why It Matters: The decision clears a path for Trump to purge career officials and gut federal agencies without Congress. It hands him sweeping power to politicize the government, dismantle oversight, and entrench loyalists\u2014accelerating the collapse of nonpartisan governance.Source: The GuardianTrump suggests taking over New York City and WashingtonWhat Happened: Trump suggested a federal takeover of New York City and Washington, D.C., claiming the White House has \u201ctremendous power\u201d to intervene if local leaders don\u2019t comply. He mocked NYC mayoral candidates and said his team is \u201ctesting\u201d cooperation with D.C.\u2019s mayor.Why It Matters: Trump is openly threatening to override local control in major U.S. cities\u2014an authoritarian move cloaked in \u201claw and order.\u201d It would be a dangerous test of executive power that echoes thuggish tactics\u2014seen in Russia\u2014used to crush democratic self-rule.Source: ABC News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsFBI launches probes into former FBI, CIA directors, Fox News reportsWhat Happened: The FBI has opened criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. The probes reportedly focus on their roles in the 2016 investigation into Russia\u2019s attack on the U.S. election. Brennan and Comey have long been targets of Trump and his allies.Why It Matters: This underscores Trump\u2019s weaponization of the Justice Department for personal revenge. Those who investigated Russia\u2019s attack on U.S. elections to help him are now facing politicized probes\u2014part of his broader authoritarian strategy to capture agencies and crush dissent.Source: ReutersDemocratic senators introduce bill to prohibit Ice agents from wearing masksWhat Happened: Senators Alex Padilla and Cory Booker introduced the \u201cVISIBLE Act\u201d to ban ICE and DHS agents from wearing masks or hiding badge numbers during immigration enforcement. The bill responds to reports of masked, unidentified agents detaining people without warrants and abducting individuals off the streets without due process.Why It Matters: Masked raids have spread fear and confusion, especially in immigrant communities. This bill seeks to restore transparency and accountability as Trump\u2019s tactics grow increasingly authoritarian. In democracies, masked men don\u2019t disappear people off the street\u2014these are hallmarks of Russia and other authoritarian regimes.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsJD Vance: Some Americans Are More American Than OthersWhat Happened: JD Vance told the far-right Claremont Institute that Americans with deep ancestral roots have a stronger claim to the country than immigrants or those who embrace American values. He rejected the idea of America as a nation built on ideals, attacking birthright citizenship and elevating heritage over principle.Why It Matters: Vance is pushing a bloodline-based extremist white nationalist ideology of citizenship. It\u2019s dangerous, fascist, and lays the groundwork for denaturalization, mass deportation, and a two-tier system of who counts as \u201ctruly\u201d American.Source: TPM\u2018They have promised retribution and retaliation\u2019: the Washington lawyer Trump is targetingWhat Happened: National security lawyer Mark Zaid, who represented the whistleblower in Trump\u2019s first impeachment over withholding aid to Ukraine, is suing the Trump regime after his security clearance was revoked in March. The CIA barred him from accessing classified information, crippling his legal practice. Zaid says it\u2019s unconstitutional retaliation for holding Trump accountable.Why It Matters: By stripping clearance from critics like Zaid, Trump is weaponizing the intelligence system to punish dissent and intimidate watchdogs. It\u2019s a direct assault on the rule of law.Source: The GuardianTrump Ominously Threatens the \u2018Corrupt Media\u2019: \u2018I Think Changes Are Going to be Made\u2019What Happened: Trump lashed out at CNN and The New York Times over reports challenging his Iran strike narrative, demanding reporters be fired and warning that \u201cchanges are going to be made\u201d to the media. He accused the press of harming military morale and labeled them \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201ccorrupt,\u201d hinting at retaliation.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian-style attack on press freedom. Trump is escalating efforts to intimidate journalists and delegitimize independent reporting\u2014paving the way to weaponize federal agencies for censorship, prosecutions, and even state-controlled media.Source: Mediaite\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsKristi Noem Guts ICE Oversight as Detainee Deaths SurgeWhat Happened: Kristi Noem shut down key oversight offices at DHS, including the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, while deaths in ICE custody surged. Her 2026 budget slashed funding, leaving just one staffer to monitor three departments amid at least 12 reported deaths this year.Why It Matters: As Trump escalates detentions, Noem is gutting the oversight meant to prevent abuse. The agency is being stripped of accountability, allowing human suffering and human rights violations to go unchecked.Source: The New RepublicTrump administration using Guantanamo to detain foreigners from 26 countries, including criminal detaineesWhat Happened: Trump is detaining dozens of migrants from 26 countries at Guantanamo Bay. DHS confirmed the site is now being used to hold both high- and low-risk immigration detainees as part of expanded deportation operations.Why It Matters: Using Guantanamo for civil immigration detention revives a symbol of past abuses and erodes legal norms. Critics warn it\u2019s an unlawful, punitive stunt that violates human rights and international standards\u2014turning a military prison into a gulag.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchU.S. Botched a Deal to Swap Venezuelans Held in El Salvador for AmericansWhat Happened: A deal to free 11 Americans and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners collapsed after Marco Rubio and Trump envoy Richard Grenell pushed competing plans. Rubio\u2019s migrant swap was nearly finalized when Grenell offered a Chevron oil concession instead\u2014causing confusion and prompting Venezuela to walk away. No Americans were released.Why It Matters: The breakdown exposes deep dysfunction in Trump\u2019s foreign policy. Clashing egos and rogue diplomacy are putting American lives at risk and destroying U.S. credibility on the world stage.Source: New York TimesDeadly floods could be new normal as Trump guts federal agencies, experts warnWhat Happened: Over 100 people died in Texas Hill Country after sudden flash floods hit homes and camps. The disaster was worsened by mass layoffs and budget cuts to FEMA and the National Weather Service, driven by Trump and Musk. Two top meteorologists were recently ousted, and FEMA leadership is in chaos as Trump moves to dismantle the agency.Why It Matters: As climate disasters intensify, Trump is gutting the institutions meant to save lives. With forecasting systems failing and FEMA in disarray, preventable deaths will rise. Source: The GuardianHow Trump's tax cuts affect federal student aidWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new tax-and-spending law guts federal financial aid by eliminating Grad PLUS loans, capping graduate borrowing, tightening Parent PLUS eligibility, and limiting deferment and forbearance. It also reclassifies Pell Grants as \u201clast dollar\u201d aid and penalizes colleges whose graduates earn less than non-college workers.Why It Matters: The law slams the door on college access for millions, especially low-income students. It shifts blame from rising costs to struggling schools and borrowers, punishing the poor while making higher education harder to afford.Source: ReutersFederal judge dismisses lawsuit seeking to stop DOJ grant cancellationsWhat Happened: A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the DOJ\u2019s decision to revoke $800 million in grants for violence prevention and victim support programs. While calling the move \u201cshameful,\u201d the judge ruled the court lacked jurisdiction and said no constitutional violations were proven.Why It Matters: This gives Trump a green light to slash funding for victim support, diversion programs, and community safety, while pouring resources into building a police state. Dozens of services have already shut down, leaving vulnerable communities without protection or recourse.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGermany accuses China of laser targeting aircraft in EU missionWhat Happened: Germany summoned China\u2019s ambassador after a Chinese warship allegedly targeted a German reconnaissance aircraft with a laser during an EU mission in the Red Sea. The incident, involving the EU\u2019s ASPIDES operation, forced the plane to abort its mission and land in Djibouti.Why It Matters: A NATO ally was targeted in international airspace by China\u2019s military, threatening personnel and sparking fresh concerns over China\u2019s growing aggression and influence near EU operations. Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussian Drone Documents Draw Line From China to Ukraine\u2019s SkiesWhat Happened: Internal documents show Russian drone maker Aero-HIT is working with Chinese suppliers, including engineers from Autel Robotics, to mass-produce combat drones. The plan includes localizing production of the Autel EVO Max 4T in Russia, aiming for 30,000 units annually.Why It Matters: This latest case reiterates China\u2019s role in arming Russia to carry out its genocidal war. By helping Russia scale drone warfare and bypass sanctions, Chinese firms are complicit in the murder of Ukrainian civilians.Source: BloombergThe Wild Russian Plot to Burn a London Restaurant and Kidnap Its OwnerWhat Happened: A London jury convicted a British gang of a Russian-directed arson attack and a plot to kidnap Russian exile Yevgeny Chichvarkin. Linked to Wagner-affiliated Telegram handlers, the gang targeted a Ukrainian warehouse and planned to abduct Chichvarkin for extradition to Russia.Why It Matters: Russia continues weaponizing criminal gangs in NATO countries to wage hybrid warfare\u2014silencing exiles, spreading terror, and carrying out sabotage. The case reveals another Kremlin operation on Western soil using an old tactic.Source: New York TimesRightwing influencers indignant over FBI claim that Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s client list doesn\u2019t existWhat Happened: A leaked DOJ-FBI memo states no Epstein \u201cclient list\u201d was ever found, contradicting years of rightwing claims. Trump allies erupted, accusing the government of a cover-up and demanding that Pam Bondi be fired for misleading the public.Why It Matters: The memo shatters a central MAGA conspiracy theory and has triggered infighting within Trump\u2019s base. It highlights the fractures and contradictions now roiling the far-right coalition.Source: The Guardian and Wall Street JournalLaura Loomer, Trump\u2019s Blunt InstrumentWhat Happened: Far-right extremist Laura Loomer is gaining influence in Trump\u2019s White House. After giving Trump a list of \u201cdisloyal\u201d officials, six were fired. Though barred from a VIP event, she still has direct access and uses public shaming to push conspiracies and enforce loyalty.Why It Matters: Loomer\u2019s rise shows how extremist voices are steering Trump\u2019s agenda and national security. Her purges, Islamophobia, and online intimidation tactics reflect a government driven by fringe ideology and fear.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump says Fed's Powell should resign immediatelyWhat Happened: Trump called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign \u201cimmediately,\u201d reigniting tensions with the central bank. Trump originally nominated Powell in 2017 but turned on him, repeatedly attacking him for economic slowdowns and opposing rate hikes.Why It Matters: Trump continues to threaten the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence and risks turning economic policy into a political weapon. Undermining a nonpartisan central bank could rattle markets, weaken the dollar, and signal to global investors that U.S. economic decisions are now driven by loyalty tests.Source: ReutersUS used car prices surge as tariffs drive market volatilityWhat Happened: U.S. used car prices jumped 6.3% year-over-year in June\u2014the biggest spike since 2022\u2014according to the Manheim Index. The surge is tied to Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imported autos, which triggered a rush in new car buying followed by sharp drops, creating volatility that\u2019s now hitting the used car market.Why It Matters: The tariffs are distorting vehicle supply chains and stoking inflation fears. With fewer leased cars entering the used market and elevated demand, prices are climbing again, just as the Fed hesitates to cut rates. Source: Reuters\u2018Essential isn\u2019t a strong enough word\u2019: Loss of foreign workers begins to bite US economyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s immigration policies are gutting the U.S. labor force, hitting farms, factories, and corporations. Mass revocations of legal work permits and ICE raids have disrupted industries dependent on immigrant labor. Businesses warn they can\u2019t function without these workers.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is backfiring economically. Labor shortages are driving up food prices, threatening supply chains, and could lead to long-term inflation and stagnation.

Two bought Google shares the same day as a key Senate hearing with AI executives; three sit on the Commerce Committee.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These trades highlight how lawmakers continue to profit while shaping policy.

His new budget law slashes royalty rates and mandates expanded leasing in the Powder River Basin.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a massive fossil fuel giveaway that puts profits over climate and public health.

Days into her tenure, Trump signed an order pausing new corruption cases, and several\\u2014including Pfizer\\u2019s\\u2014were dropped or stalled.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Bondi\\u2019s actions directly benefited a former client while weakening global anti-bribery enforcement.

The ruling backs Trump\\u2019s executive order tied to Project 2025, his plan to remake the federal government and centralize control.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The decision clears a path for Trump to purge career officials and gut federal agencies without Congress.

He mocked NYC mayoral candidates and said his team is \\u201Ctesting\\u201D cooperation with D.C.\\u2019s mayor.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly threatening to override local control in major U.S. cities\\u2014an authoritarian move cloaked in \\u201Claw and order.\\u201D It would be a dangerous test of executive power that echoes thuggish tactics\\u2014seen in Russia\\u2014used to crush democratic self-rule.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-suggests-taking-new-york-city-washington/story?id=123581492\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>FBI launches probes into former FBI, CIA directors, Fox News reports</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FBI has opened criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. The probes reportedly focus on their roles in the 2016 investigation into Russia\\u2019s attack on the U.S. election. Brennan and Comey have long been targets of Trump and his allies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This underscores Trump\\u2019s weaponization of the Justice Department for personal revenge.

The bill responds to reports of masked, unidentified agents detaining people without warrants and abducting individuals off the streets without due process.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Masked raids have spread fear and confusion, especially in immigrant communities.

The CIA barred him from accessing classified information, crippling his legal practice. Zaid says it\\u2019s unconstitutional retaliation for holding Trump accountable.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By stripping clearance from critics like Zaid, Trump is weaponizing the intelligence system to punish dissent and intimidate watchdogs.

Her 2026 budget slashed funding, leaving just one staffer to monitor three departments amid at least 12 reported deaths this year.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As Trump escalates detentions, Noem is gutting the oversight meant to prevent abuse.

Two top meteorologists were recently ousted, and FEMA leadership is in chaos as Trump moves to dismantle the agency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As climate disasters intensify, Trump is gutting the institutions meant to save lives.

It also reclassifies Pell Grants as \\u201Clast dollar\\u201D aid and penalizes colleges whose graduates earn less than non-college workers.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The law slams the door on college access for millions, especially low-income students.
