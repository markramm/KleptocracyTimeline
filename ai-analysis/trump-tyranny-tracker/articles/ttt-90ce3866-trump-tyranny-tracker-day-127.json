Sophie Park/Getty Images North AmericaShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 26Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.On this Memorial Day, I want to take a moment and honor the American servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend democracy and protect the freedoms we so often take for granted. Their courage demands not only remembrance, but a continued commitment to confronting the threats that seek to dismantle everything they died to protect.Don\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Pardons Virginia Sheriff Convicted of BriberyWhat Happened: Trump pardoned former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was serving a 10-year sentence for selling deputy badges for cash\u2014including to undercover FBI agents. Trump called the case \u201cpolitical,\u201d framing Jenkins as a victim of the Biden DOJ.Why It Matters: This is yet another blatant abuse of presidential power to shield corrupt loyalists. Jenkins was caught red-handed and Trump\u2019s pardon again sends a clear signal that loyalty to him outweighs the law. It\u2019s a green light for corruption and criminal behavior\u2014and reiterates that Trump will protect his enforcers, no matter what crimes they commit.Source: Associated PressMembers Only: A New Trump Club, Ned\u2019s Club and the Enduring Old GuardWhat Happened: Trump allies are launching Executive Branch, a $500,000 private club in Georgetown for fewer than 200 MAGA elites\u2014barring journalists and traditional GOP figures.Why It Matters: Washington\u2019s power elite is splintering. Trump\u2019s club consolidates wealth and influence in a closed, MAGA-aligned network\u2014shielded from scrutiny and designed for deal-making in the shadows.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Politics of Plunder: A New Gilded Age of Corruption and InfluenceWhat Happened: The New Yorker exposes how Trump\u2019s second term has normalized the fusion of state power and personal profit. At its core is \u201cThe Executive Branch,\u201d a $500,000 MAGA club run by Don Jr., David Sacks, and other insiders. Members buy elite access to top officials\u2014including $5 million one-on-one meetings with Trump. A veteran lobbyist called it \u201couter-borough Mafia shit.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s White House isn\u2019t just corrupt but a marketplace for oligarchs. Figures like Mark Zuckerberg are buying direct influence, while watchdogs are sidelined, ethics rules dismantled, and policy sold to the highest bidder. Source: The New Yorker\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Vision: One World, Three Powers?What Happened: Trump is pushing a 19th-century-style foreign policy where the U.S., Russia, and China each dominate their own regions. He\u2019s praised Putin and Xi, floated annexing Canada and Greenland, and proposed legitimizing Russia\u2019s seizure of Ukrainian land in exchange for U.S. mineral access. Meanwhile, Rubio and Vance are expanding U.S. influence in Latin America through military deals, port control, and migrant detentions.Why It Matters: Trump is discarding alliances and democratic norms to strike imperial-style bargains with autocrats. This model empowers authoritarian regimes, weakens global human rights protections, and treats sovereign nations like bargaining chips for mineral wealth and influence. Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsBongino says FBI looking at \u2018a number of cases of potential public corruption\u2019What Happened: FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced the bureau is shifting resources to probe several high-profile \u201cpublic corruption\u201d cases: the leaked Dobbs draft, cocaine found in the Biden White House, and the unsolved Jan. 6 pipe bombs. He said these cases \u201cgarnered public interest\u201d and deserve renewed scrutiny.Why It Matters: More politicization of the FBI under Trump loyalists Bongino and Kash Patel. The cases align with MAGA conspiracies\u2014not urgent law enforcement priorities\u2014and will be weaponized to fuel more conspiracy theories, and attack Trump\u2019s political enemies under the cover of corruption investigations.Source: The HillTrump Threatens to Strip Harvard of $3B in Grants, Redirect Funds to Trade SchoolsWhat Happened: Trump vowed to strip $3 billion in grants from Harvard and divert it to trade schools, accusing the university of antisemitism and \u201cwoke\u201d politics. This follows legal clashes over student visas and a broader federal funding review.Why It Matters: It\u2019s a direct attack on academic freedom. Trump is using federal dollars as a political weapon\u2014punishing elite institutions who refuse to bend the knee.Source: Wall Street JournalSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News\u2018That\u2019s the Way Militaries Work in Russia and China and North Korea\u2019What Happened: Rep. Seth Moulton is warning that Trump\u2019s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is gutting military leadership for political loyalty\u2014not strategy. The purge has ousted top women and Black commanders, including Admiral Lisa Franchetti and General C.Q. Brown, under orders to purge 20% of four-star officers.Why It Matters: Moulton says the firings resemble the power plays of Russia and China\u2014replacing independent military leaders with obedient loyalists. The result? A politicized, weakened military that puts ideology above readiness. \u201cIt\u2019s not just dangerous\u2014it\u2019s un-American.\u201dSource: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsAlabama Worker Says ICE Dragged Him From Job Despite Being U.S. Citizen: \u2018Color of Our Skin Has Become a Crime\u2019What Happened: Leonardo Garc\u00eda Venegas, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen born in Florida, was forcibly detained by ICE during a workplace raid in Alabama. Video shows agents grabbing him while bystanders shouted he\u2019s American. He was released hours later.Why It Matters: The case highlights racial profiling and civil rights violations as ICE increasingly targets Latino workers based on appearance, not legal status, reiterating a dangerous erosion of due process.Source: Al.com\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s mass federal cuts disrupt LA wildfire recovery: \u2018It\u2019s coming tumbling down\u2019What Happened: As Los Angeles reels from January\u2019s deadly wildfires, Trump and Musk have gutted the federal agencies responsible for disaster relief. FEMA, AmeriCorps, the EPA, and the Army Corps of Engineers have lost thousands of staff. Housing aid has stopped, cleanup efforts have stalled, and even FEMA\u2019s leader was fired for pushing back.Why It Matters: Survivors are being abandoned mid-crisis. Vital federal services are collapsing just as climate disasters grow worse. Trump\u2019s deliberate dismantling of aid systems is setting the stage for catastrophic failure nationwide.Source: The GuardianTrump Cuts Threaten Critical Mapping Office Behind U.S. InfrastructureWhat Happened: Trump has purged staff at the National Geodetic Survey, a critical NOAA agency responsible for the U.S. spatial reference system\u2014precise measurements of latitude, longitude, elevation, and gravity. The cuts jeopardize a major upgrade to national geospatial data.Why It Matters: NGS is essential to infrastructure, climate research, disaster response, and everyday mapping. Experts warn the U.S. is now losing the scientific foundation for measuring and understanding its own geography. As one put it: \u201cIt\u2019s like oxygen\u2014you don\u2019t realize you need it until it\u2019s gone.\u201dSource: Mother JonesTrump Adviser Admits GOP Tax Bill Slashes MedicaidWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, admitted the GOP tax bill slashes $880 billion from Medicaid\u2014despite Republican claims it only targets \u201cfraud.\u201d The bill\u2019s work requirements could strip health coverage from at least 10 million low-income and disabled Americans.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the rich, while pretending to protect working-class families. Even eligible recipients could lose care due to the new rules. Source: Rolling Stones\u2018It\u2019s just devastating\u2019: Federal workers grapple with canceled health insurance, bungled benefits after Trump\u2019s layoff chaosWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s chaotic purge of the federal workforce has stranded thousands of reinstated employees without health insurance, pensions, or workers\u2019 comp. IRS and Education Department workers report ER bills, missed cancer screenings, and delayed care as decimated HR departments can\u2019t process benefits.Why It Matters: The fallout is severe with families rationing medicine, retirees missing checks, and critical agencies paralyzed. Advocates say the damage is by design and one Trump adviser admitted the goal was to leave \u201cbureaucrats traumatically affected.\u201d Source: CNN\u2018Terrifying\u2019: Trump Cuts CDC\u2019s Drowning-Prevention Team Amid Rising Child DeathsWhat Happened: Trump eliminated the CDC\u2019s drowning-prevention team, even as drowning remains the top cause of death for kids ages 1 to 4. The team tracked national data, issued safety alerts, and partnered with groups like the YMCA to provide swim lessons for vulnerable children. Why It Matters: Drowning deaths are rising and experts warn this cut will cost lives. With no staff to analyze data or manage grants, critical prevention tools are vanishing. Advocates call the decision \u201cterrifying\u201d and a direct threat to child safety.Source: Politico\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchKing Charles visits Canada to deliver throne speech amid Trump's annexation threatsWhat Happened: King Charles III arrived in Ottawa to deliver a rare speech from the throne\u2014an intentional move to reaffirm Canada\u2019s sovereignty after Trump threatened annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the monarch to underline Canada's distinct identity, constitutional monarchy, and rejection of Trump\u2019s rhetoric.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s annexation threats has ruined U.S.\u2013Canada relations. King Charles\u2019 visit serves as a symbolic counterpunch\u2014affirming Canada\u2019s independence and drawing a sharp contrast between liberal democracy and Trump\u2019s expansionist nationalism.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Intensifies Attacks on Ukraine as U.S. Steps BackWhat Happened: Russia unleashed its largest missile and drone barrage in months, killing dozens across Ukraine. While Trump publicly \u201ccriticized\u201d Putin, he offered no new aid and reiterated, \u201cThis is not Trump\u2019s war.\u201d Authorized U.S. military support remains frozen, with no new weapons shipments approved.Why It Matters: Ukraine is running low on critical defenses as Russia intensifies its assault. Trump\u2019s fealty to Moscow\u2014and his efforts to provide cover for Russian aggression\u2014is creating a dangerous situation allowing Russia to gain ground in its genocidal war against Ukraine. Source: New York TimesRussia is preparing new offensives, according to Ukraine intelligence: ZelenskyyWhat Happened: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy warned that intelligence shows Russia preparing major new offensives, with no intention of peace. His remarks came after Russia launched its largest aerial assault yet\u2014364 drones and missiles in a single night\u2014killing at least 18 civilians over the weekend.Why It Matters: As Trump withholds new aid, Ukraine is being left increasingly isolated. Zelenskyy\u2019s stark warning signals that Russia is preparing for more war\u2014while U.S. support is nonexistent.Source: ABC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Tariffs Trigger Drop in U.S. Tourism from Key AlliesWhat Happened: Trivago reports a sharp drop in U.S. hotel bookings from tourists in tariff-hit nations\u2014Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. Canadian travel is plummeting amid outrage over Trump\u2019s annexation rhetoric. Domestic travel is up, but Americans are downgrading to budget hotels as economic fears grow.Why It Matters: The U.S. tourism sector is entering a \u201cTrump slump,\u201d with international visits down 11.6% in March alone. As Trump\u2019s trade wars escalate, global travelers are steering clear\u2014costing the U.S. billions in lost revenue.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Tariffs and GOP Budget Threaten U.S. Battery IndustryWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese battery components and GOP budget cuts to clean energy subsidies are jeopardizing America\u2019s grid battery sector. Plants like LG\u2019s in Michigan face rising costs and delayed rollouts. Tesla and Fluence say the instability is already cutting into revenues.Why It Matters: Grid-scale batteries are essential for storing solar and wind power. Without them, utilities may fall back on costly fossil fuel plants, raising energy prices and stalling climate progress. Source: New York TimesEurope is already responding to Trump tariffsWhat Happened: After Trump temporarily delayed 50% tariffs on the EU, European leaders and corporations quickly pivoted. France\u2019s Macron sealed a 20-jet Airbus deal with Vietnam, while Sweden\u2019s Volvo announced 3,000 layoffs and pulled China-made cars from U.S. markets to blunt the tariff hit.Why It Matters: Even short-term pauses in Trump\u2019s trade war are fueling global realignments. Europe is diversifying away from the U.S., strengthening ties with Asia, and bracing for more economic volatility under Trump\u2019s erratic policy swings.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite on June 6th in D.C.Former Harvard president urges people to \u2018speak out\u2019 against threats to US democracyWhat Happened: Former Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust urged Americans to \u201cstand up\u201d against rising authoritarianism, warning in a Memorial Day New York Times essay that U.S. democracy and constitutional checks are \u201cat risk\u201d under Trump.

key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><blockquote><p>On this Memorial Day, I want to take a moment and honor the American servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend democracy and protect the freedoms we so often take for granted. Their courage demands not only remembrance, but a continued commitment to confronting the threats that seek to dismantle everything they died to protect.</p></blockquote><div><hr/></div><p><strong><span>Don\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with </span><a href=\"https://open.substack.com/users/8215350-zev-shalev?utm_source=mentions\" rel=\"\">Zev Shalev</a><span>\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.</span></strong></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption News</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7in-corruption-news\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/164521097/in-corruption-news\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p></p><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Trump Pardons Virginia Sheriff Convicted of Bribery<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trump-pardons-virginia-sheriff-convicted-of-bribery\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/164521097/trump-pardons-virginia-sheriff-convicted-of-bribery\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump pardoned former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was serving a 10-year sentence for selling deputy badges for cash\u2014including to undercover FBI agents.
