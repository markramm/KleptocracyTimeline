(AP Photo/Gerry Broome, File)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 30Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 10Google Meet: August 5, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump privately discussing plans to host G20 at his Doral resort, White House official saysWhat Happened: Trump is quietly discussing hosting the 2026 G20 summit at his Trump National Doral resort in Miami, reviving his scrapped 2020 G7 plan. This is pure corruption, blatantly using the presidency to enrich his personal businesses.Why It Matters: Hosting a global summit at his own property would funnel foreign government money directly into Trump\u2019s pockets\u2014again, violating the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause. It epitomizes how Trump is using public office as a tool for private profit.Source: CNNBill Barring Stock Trading for Congress Advances With Trump Carve-OutWhat Happened: A Senate committee advanced a bill banning stock trading by Congress, the president, and VP. Meanwhile, Sen. Josh Hawley added a carve-out shielding Trump from divestment rules. Democrats backed it anyway, citing public outrage over insider profits.Why It Matters: The carve-out protects Trump while weakening reforms. Despite strong public support, GOP resistance and Trump\u2019s opposition will kill meaningful anti-corruption legislation.Source: New York TimesWhite House Urges \u2018Pro-Innovation Mind-Set\u2019 to Crypto in New ReportWhat Happened: The White House released a 168-page report urging agencies to push cryptocurrency trading, craft new regulations, and make digital assets central to a \u201cnew American Golden Age.\u201d It calls for allowing trading platforms to custody crypto, tailored disclosure rules, and expanded SEC and CFTC authority for immediate federal trading\u2014fulfilling Trump\u2019s pledge to make the U.S. a \u201ccrypto nation.\u201d The plan mirrors Trump\u2019s pro-crypto stance as his family profits from memecoins and World Liberty Financial\u2019s stablecoin ventures.Why It Matters: More corruption as Trump reshapes financial policy to enrich himself and his family\u2019s digital currency businesses, weakening oversight and embedding conflicts of interest into U.S. economic governance.Source: New York Times and ReutersEthics officials say Georgia PAC tied to Ponzi scheme illegally sought to influence electionsWhat Happened: Georgia\u2019s Ethics Commission filed a complaint alleging the now-dissolved Georgia Republican Assembly PAC, tied to a $140 million Ponzi scheme run by Edwin Brant Frost IV, illegally sought to influence elections between 2021 and 2024. Controlled by Frost\u2019s son, the PAC spent over $220,000 backing and opposing candidates without registering.Why It Matters: This shows how fraudulent financial networks can secretly bankroll political operations, tilting elections without disclosure. It exposes campaign finance vulnerabilities to dark money and corruption within party politics.Source: Associated PressTrump Crypto Group Offers Proposals to Boost Digital FinanceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s crypto task force proposed sweeping deregulation of digital assets, urging regulators to ease trading rules and bank access while laying the groundwork for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve holding nearly 200,000 seized coins.Why It Matters: Pure corruption\u2014Trump is deregulating crypto to benefit himself and his allies. The plan hands them massive financial leverage over U.S. digital finance while opening the door to speculation, political influence peddling, fraud, and money laundering.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTexas Republicans get a bigger House edge under a new map, meeting Trump's goalsWhat Happened: Texas Republicans proposed a new congressional map adding 5 GOP-leaning seats, boosting their potential hold to 30 of 38 districts. Fast-tracked by Gov. Greg Abbott, the map carves up Democratic urban centers and merges incumbents, aligning with Trump\u2019s push to secure a lasting House majority before 2026.Why It Matters: This is a blatant power grab\u2014Trump and Republicans are gerrymandering to lock in control, silencing Black, Hispanic, and urban voters. With similar schemes in Missouri and beyond, they\u2019re rigging maps to cement rule and kill fair representation nationwide.Source: Washington PostTrump Authorizes Deployment of National Guard at ICE FacilitiesWhat Happened: Trump officials approved deploying 1,700 National Guard troops to immigration detention centers across 20 Republican-led states to assist ICE with migrant processing and deportation operations. Guard units won\u2019t conduct raids but will handle admin and transport duties, freeing ICE agents for enforcement.Why It Matters: This is the continued militarization of immigration enforcement. It escalates Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda and blurs military-civilian boundaries, raising serious constitutional concerns under the Posse Comitatus Act\u2014today it\u2019s immigrants, tomorrow it\u2019s anyone who defies Trump.Source: New York TimesHow Trump Is Attacking the Legal System, via the Legal SystemWhat Happened: Trump is escalating attacks on the judiciary by appointing loyalists like former defense lawyer Emil Bove to top courts and suing judges who block his agenda. His regime has filed misconduct complaints and pushed cases to strip courts of oversight on immigration policy.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing the legal system to erode checks on presidential power, trying to turn courts into enforcers of his will rather than upholders of the law.Source: New York TimesResignation of a Top US Nuclear Regulator Seen as an Attack on Agency IndependenceWhat Happened: NRC Commissioner Annie Caputo resigned as Trump moves to politicize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, firing its previous chair and installing loyalist David Wright. Insiders warn the agency is being turned into a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for fast-tracked nuclear reactor approvals.Why It Matters: This guts the NRC\u2019s independence as a nuclear safety watchdog. Politicizing oversight undermines public health protections, destabilizes nuclear investment, and shatters decades of bipartisan regulatory stability.Source: Mother Jones\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsHow Edward \u2018Big Balls\u2019 Coristine and DOGE Got Access to a Federal Payroll System That Serves the FBIWhat Happened: WIRED found that DOGE aide Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine gained rapid, admin-level access to SBA and USDA systems handling payroll for 650,000 federal employees, including FBI and DOJ staff, bypassing standard vetting.Why It Matters: The breach exposed sensitive data and shows how unauthorized, unvetted DOGE operatives can quietly access and merge federal datasets, creating major national security and privacy risks. For months, they\u2019ve been fusing data from every agency to build a centralized surveillance system on all Americans.Source: WIREDRepublicans Consider Changing Senate Rules to Speed Confirmation of Trump NomineesWhat Happened: Senate Republicans are considering rule changes to speed confirmation of Trump\u2019s executive branch nominees amid Democratic delays. Majority Leader John Thune says GOP support is \u201cgrowing quickly,\u201d while Trump pressures senators to cancel their August recess to fast-track dozens of appointments.Why It Matters: This further shreds Senate norms, letting Trump rapidly stack agencies and courts with loyalists. It\u2019s another move to dismantle checks and balances and turn government into his personal patronage machine.Source: Associated PressSenate confirms Trump\u2019s pick for counterterrorism agency, a former Green Beret with extremist tiesWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed Joe Kent, a former Green Beret with ties to far-right extremists and Jan. 6 conspiracy theories and lies, as head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Democrats opposed, citing Kent\u2019s links to Proud Boys, Christian nationalists, and his role in shaping intelligence to support Trump\u2019s deportation agenda.Why It Matters: Trump just put a far-right loyalist in charge of U.S. counterterrorism. This politicizes intelligence, hands wartime powers to an extremist, and shatters nonpartisan national security leadership.Source: Associated PressTrump to require states use terrorism funds for migrant arrestsWhat Happened: Trump will require states to divert at least 10% of federal terrorism prevention funds to migrant arrests and immigration enforcement. FEMA says states can use the money to build internment camps or partner with ICE.Why It Matters: This hijacks counterterrorism funding to target migrants, erasing the line between national security and immigration policy. It\u2019s another step in Trump\u2019s strategy to weaponize federal funds and state resources to expand mass detention and deportation.Source: ReutersDOJ Memo Says Minority Scholarships, Diverse Slates UnlawfulWhat Happened: A DOJ memo from Pam Bondi warns that scholarships, mentorships, and hiring initiatives based on race, gender, or other traits are unlawful for federal contractors. It also targets \u201cdiverse slate\u201d hiring practices and diversity statements in applications.Why It Matters: The move escalates Trump\u2019s anti-DEI push, threatening programs that diversify universities, nonprofits, and federal contractors nationwide.Source: BloombergTrump Launches Health Data Tracking System with Big TechWhat Happened: Trump unveiled a program letting Americans upload personal health data and medical records to apps run by Google, Amazon, Apple, and others. Officials claim it will modernize electronic records and improve chronic disease management, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2014led by Mehmet Oz\u2014overseeing a launch early next year.Why It Matters: This hands Big Tech and Trump\u2019s regime access to sensitive health data, ripe for monetization and abuse. With CMS already sharing information with immigration authorities, it underscores mass surveillance and exploitation of Americans\u2019 medical records.Source: Associated Press and more Associated PressArmy secretary directs West Point to rescind appointment of Biden-era cybersecurity directorWhat Happened: Army Secretary Dan Driscoll ordered West Point to rescind its appointment of Jen Easterly, Biden\u2019s former cybersecurity director, as a distinguished chair in its social sciences department. Easterly, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, had been criticized by Republicans for \u201ccensoring election and COVID-19 information\u201d\u2014claims she has denied.Why It Matters: Trump continues his purge of perceived political opponents from military and academic institutions. It\u2019s an authoritarian-style effort to remake the military\u2019s leadership pipeline to enforce MAGA loyalty over merit and democratic principlesSource: ABC NewsTrump memo asks federal fund recipients to restrict DEIWhat Happened: The Justice Department issued a memo ordering schools, universities, nonprofits, and contractors receiving federal funds to ban DEI programs. It expands Trump\u2019s prior executive orders, prohibiting targeted scholarships, outreach to marginalized communities, and other DEI initiatives under threat of funding cuts.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s most aggressive move yet to dismantle DEI nationwide. By weaponizing federal dollars, he\u2019s erasing programs meant to remedy historic inequities and pushing a standard that entrenches systemic discrimination.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUS placed on rights watchlist over health of its civil society under TrumpWhat Happened: The international NGO Civicus placed the U.S. on its rights watchlist for \u201csustained attacks on civic freedoms,\u201d citing militarized crackdowns on protests, restrictions on journalists and civil society, and the criminalization of anti-war advocacy. It downgraded U.S. civic space to \u201cnarrowed,\u201d ranking it alongside El Salvador and Kenya.Why It Matters: Six months into Trump\u2019s second term, fundamental freedoms are collapsing. Peaceful dissent is met with force, the military is on the streets, independent media is defunded, and activists face reprisals. This is how an authoritarian system takes root.Source: The GuardianTrump freezes $108M at Duke amid inquiry into alleged racial discriminationWhat Happened: Trump froze $108 million in federal research funding for Duke University, accusing it of racial \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in admissions, hiring, and scholarships. A joint HHS and Education Department letter declared Duke \u201cunfit for further financial relationship\u201d with the government unless it ends all race-based advantages.Why It Matters: With 60% of Duke\u2019s $1.5 billion research budget reliant on federal grants, the freeze delivers a severe financial blow and underscores similar crackdowns on other institutions as Trump tries to take control of universities.Source: Associated PressBrown University strikes agreement with Trump administration to restore lost federal fundingWhat Happened: Brown University agreed to pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce groups and adopt Trump\u2019s extremist policies\u2014including removing race from admissions and enforcing government definitions of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d\u2014to restore suspended federal research funding and end discrimination probes.Why It Matters: Trump continues using federal dollars to impose ideological control over universities, reshaping admissions and campus policies to fit MAGA priorities\u2014number one rule: Never capitulate to dictators.Source: Associated PressUS Government Alleges UCLA Violated Civil Rights LawWhat Happened: The Justice Department accused UCLA of failing to protect Jewish and Israeli students from a hostile environment during pro-Palestinian protests. Trump officials have threatened to freeze federal funding.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on universities. It underscores Trump\u2019s weaponization of agencies to attack free speech and academic freedom while policing political expression on campuses.Source: ReutersDespite grand claims, a new report shows noncitizen voting hasn't materializedWhat Happened: A report from the Center for Election Innovation & Research found that despite Trump\u2019s claims of mass noncitizen voting in 2024, states uncovered only isolated cases\u2014Michigan found just 16 out of 5.7 million votes (0.00028%). Nationwide reviews show no evidence of coordinated noncitizen voting efforts.Why It Matters: This dismantles a core justification for Trump\u2019s election crackdowns and immigrant demonization. Noncitizen voting remains virtually nonexistent, exposing Trump\u2019s lie as a political weapon, not a real threat to election integrity.Source: NPR\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsA challenge to the suspension of a refugee program established by Congress receives class-action statusWhat Happened: A federal judge in Washington State granted class-action status to a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, which has admitted over three million refugees since 1980. The ruling could allow a broader injunction to restore admissions despite a Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions.Why It Matters: This opens a new legal path to challenge Trump\u2019s refugee ban, potentially reopening the door for thousands of refugees, including U.S. wartime allies. It underscores judicial resistance to Trump\u2019s unilateral dismantling of a congressionally mandated refugee system.Source: New York TimesICE Arrested These Immigrants in San Francisco and Sent Them 2,400 Miles Away\u2014to HawaiiWhat Happened: ICE agents arrested at least two immigrants outside a San Francisco immigration court and transferred them 2,400 miles away to a federal prison in Hawaii due to a lack of local detention centers. One detainee, deemed possibly mentally impaired by a judge, was taken moments after receiving a court continuance.Why It Matters: ICE is using long-distance transfers to isolate detainees from legal counsel and fast-track deportations. The raises human rights concerns, particularly for vulnerable detainees, while straining due process protections for asylum-seekers.Source: Mother JonesArizona Democrat challenges Trump after denied entry to Ice facility: \u2018We can\u2019t look the other way\u2019What Happened: Rep. Greg Stanton was denied entry to an Arizona ICE detention center while trying to visit a detained local restaurant owner facing deportation. Although federal law allows unannounced congressional oversight visits, Trump\u2019s regime imposed a seven-day notice rule and has repeatedly blocked Democratic lawmakers.Why It Matters: Trump officials continue openly defying the law to hide detention conditions and due process abuses. It\u2019s part of a broader effort to block oversight as his mass deportation campaign accelerates.Source: The GuardianNow That They\u2019re FreeWhat Happened: Over 230 Venezuelan men disappeared by ICE were sent to a Salvadoran gulag, where they endured months of beatings, psychological abuse, and inhumane treatment. Most had no U.S. criminal convictions, many had pending asylum claims, and tattoos were misused as \u201cgang evidence.\u201dWhy It Matters: The U.S. outsourced mass deportation to a foreign gulag, disappearing asylum-seekers without due process and subjecting them to torture. The U.S. is committing human rights violations under Trump\u2019s deportation regime.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchEx-CIA agent hits back at Tulsi Gabbard after she accused Obama of \u2018treasonous conspiracy\u2019 against TrumpWhat Happened: Former CIA counterintelligence chief Susan Miller blasted DNI Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s claim that Obama staged a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d against Trump in 2016. Miller said her team\u2019s findings on Russian election interference were based on verified intelligence\u2014not fabricated evidence or the Steele dossier\u2014and had nothing to do with hacking vote machines or partisan bias.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing taxpayer-funded federal agencies to shield Russia and rewrite history, laying the groundwork for prosecutions of former officials who investigated Russia\u2019s attack. Of course, Russia attacked the 2016 election to get him into power\u2014and those who documented it are in his crosshairs.Source: The GuardianMore Trump figures who met Laura Loomer\u2019s ire are out. A look at her influenceWhat Happened: Far-right extremist Laura Loomer is driving Trump regime purges, with officials like FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad and West Point\u2019s Jen Easterly ousted soon after her attacks. She\u2019s also claimed credit for purges at the National Security Council and DOJ, targeting those deemed \u201cdisloyal\u201d to Trump.Why It Matters: This is insane\u2014a fringe extremist continues to have power to shape federal staffing and policy. Trump is purging seasoned professionals and replacing them with loyal ideologues, endangering U.S. national security and every American at home and abroad. Our allies and adversaries are watching this insanity very closely.Source: Associated PressTwo US Justice Dept antitrust officials fired over merger controversy, source saysWhat Happened: 2 senior Justice Department antitrust officials were removed for alleged \u201cinsubordination\u201d after a controversial settlement approved Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. The purge exposes internal clashes between antitrust enforcers and Trump dealmakers accused of politically steering merger approvals.Why It Matters: This reeks of corporate favoritism and political meddling in antitrust enforcement. Democratic senators are demanding judicial review to see if the merger was a political favor, undermining fair competition and public trust in DOJ oversight.Source: Reuters3 fired DOJ workers add to chorus of layoffs in 'foundering' workforceWhat Happened: Three more senior DOJ officials were fired, adding to hundreds of career employees purged this year as Trump seizes the department. Immigration judges, forensic accountants, and prosecutors have been ousted for resisting political pressure, while whistleblowers report court defiance and loyalists like Emil Bove being promoted to top judicial posts.Why It Matters: Trump continues a mass purge, turning the DOJ into his political enforcement arm. Experienced professionals are being replaced with subservients, gutting independent law enforcement and eroding the rule of law in favor of authoritarian control.Source: NPRFDA vaccine chief leaving agency after less than 3 months Vaccine Chief Leaving Agency After Less Than 3 MonthsWhat Happened: Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator, resigned less than three months into the role amid clashes with biotech firms, patient groups, and Trump\u2019s conservative allies. Health officials called it a move to avoid \u201cdistraction,\u201d but sources say he was forced out.Why It Matters: Trump and RFK Jr. are dismantling vaccine oversight, undermining public trust in immunization programs, and crippling the FDA\u2019s scientific independence. This power grab leaves vaccine policy vulnerable to political interference and conspiracy-driven agendas.Source: Associated PressUS medical groups fill gap with own vaccine guides amid \u2018information crisis\u2019What Happened: With RFK Jr. running HHS, federal agencies have weakened flu, RSV, and Covid vaccine guidance, ignoring scientific consensus. Medical organizations and the Vaccine Integrity Project are now issuing independent, evidence-based recommendations to fill the void.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s politicized health policy is gutting vaccine oversight, fueling hesitancy, and risking deadly outbreaks\u2014leaving independent experts to take over public health leadership once entrusted to the CDC.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchU.S. sanctions Brazilian Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who's overseeing case against Trump ally Jair BolsonaroWhat Happened: The Treasury Department sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, accusing him of \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d and politically motivated prosecutions against Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Marco Rubio alleged \u201ccensorship, detentions, and secret orders\u201d to silence critics, while Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports over alleged \u201cattacks on democracy.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is an unprecedented U.S. intervention in Brazil\u2019s judiciary to protect insurrectionist criminal Bolsonaro. Aligning U.S. foreign policy with an insurrectionist, Trump is destabilizing U.S.\u2013Brazil relations and normalizing sanctions against foreign judges upholding their own legal system.Source: CBS NewsPresident Lula hits back as Trump tariffs threaten US-Brazil trade showdownWhat Happened: Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said Brazil will not bow to Trump\u2019s planned 50% tariffs, urging negotiations based on sovereignty rather than fear. Trump tied the tariffs to the prosecution of his ally Jair Bolsonaro, who faces coup-plotting charges\u2014something Lula says is a judicial matter, not political.Source: The GuardianUS to Discuss Any Troop Withdrawal With NATO, Estonia Chief SaysWhat Happened: Estonia\u2019s defense chief said any U.S. decision to withdraw troops from Europe would be coordinated with NATO, though no guarantees were given to maintain current forces. Baltic leaders warned that reducing U.S. presence on NATO\u2019s eastern flank would embolden Moscow.Why It Matters: As Trump reviews U.S. force levels in Europe, allies fear a pullback that could weaken NATO\u2019s deterrence against Russian aggression. The Baltics, heavily reliant on American security guarantees, face growing uncertainty about long-term U.S. commitments.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Threatens India With 25% Tariffs, Penalty for Russian Oil DealsWhat Happened: Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian imports starting Friday, criticizing India\u2019s high trade barriers and its purchases of Russian oil and military equipment. Source: New York TimesFox News has aired 168 segments about Tulsi Gabbard's revisionist claims regarding Russia, Obama, and the 2016 electionWhat Happened: Since Tulsi Gabbard declassified baseless claims that the Obama administration \u201cfabricated\u201d intelligence on Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, Fox News has aired 168 segments amplifying the disinformation.Why It Matters: Fox is running a revisionist cover story to shield Trump from Epstein and rewrite history\u2014denying Russia\u2019s role in installing him in 2016 while priming MAGA supporters to back future prosecutions of his political enemies.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsUS pending home sales fall more than expected in JuneWhat Happened: Contracts to buy previously owned homes in the U.S. fell 0.8% in June, surprising economists who expected a 0.3% rise. Pending home sales were down 2.8% year-over-year, with higher mortgage rates cited as a primary factor.Source: ReutersFed policy decision generates most governor dissents since 1993What Happened: The Federal Reserve held rates at 4.25%-4.50%, with Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissenting\u2014the first dual opposition since 1993. Both Trump appointees pushed for a rate cut, aligning with Trump\u2019s push to ease borrowing costs despite tariff-driven inflation risks.Why It Matters: The split shows mounting pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell as Trump demands lower rates. Trump\u2019s attacks and takeover attempts threaten Fed independence, paving the way for full White House control over U.S. monetary policy.Source: ReutersFord Is Latest Carmaker to Blame Tariffs for Profit SlumpWhat Happened: Ford reported a $36 million loss in Q2, compared to a $1.8 billion profit last year, citing Trump\u2019s tariffs as a major driver. The automaker expects $2 billion in tariff-related costs this year, including 50% duties on imported steel and aluminum, which affect vehicles built largely in the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies are slamming U.S. automakers\u2014slashing profits, raising costs, and failing to boost domestic production. The result: higher car prices for Americans and a blow to the long-term competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Ohio city whose Haitian migrants were disparaged by Trump braces to defend them against deportationWhat Happened: Springfield, Ohio\u2014a city where Trump spread lies about Haitian migrants\u2014now faces mass deportations as the regime ends temporary protected status for 500,000 Haitians.

This is pure corruption, blatantly using the presidency to enrich his personal businesses.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Hosting a global summit at his own property would funnel foreign government money directly into Trump\\u2019s pockets\\u2014again, violating the Constitution\\u2019s Emoluments Clause.

Controlled by Frost\\u2019s son, the PAC spent over $220,000 backing and opposing candidates without registering.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shows how fraudulent financial networks can secretly bankroll political operations, tilting elections without disclosure.

Democrats opposed, citing Kent\\u2019s links to Proud Boys, Christian nationalists, and his role in shaping intelligence to support Trump\\u2019s deportation agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump just put a far-right loyalist in charge of U.S. counterterrorism.
