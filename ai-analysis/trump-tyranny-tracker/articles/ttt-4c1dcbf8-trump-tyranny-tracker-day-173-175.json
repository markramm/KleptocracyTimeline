This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct6eN0zD4V-eFBAJgR2zCiIIo4ycjZysrCYixcdDpNfm1c1Q/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Mobile Keeps Charging My Credit Card And I Have No Idea WhyWhat Happened: Journalist Joseph Cox says Trump Mobile has repeatedly charged his credit card for a phone he never received\u2014despite error messages, no shipping info, and unreachable customer service. Others report similar issues with unauthorized charges.Why It Matters: Another Trump scam operation. Trump\u2019s brand is profiting from chaos, billing supporters and customers while failing to deliver. Source: 404 MediaT-Mobile scraps DEI while awaiting deal approvals from FCCWhat Happened: T-Mobile announced it will eliminate all DEI programs and scrub DEI language from its platforms while awaiting FCC approval for two acquisitions. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr praised the move, calling it a step toward \u201cnondiscrimination.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is political coercion masquerading as regulation. The FCC is pressuring corporations to abandon DEI or risk having deals blocked\u2014weaponizing federal oversight to enforce right-wing ideology.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsEmil Bove declines to rule out 3rd Trump term or denounce Jan. 6 rioters in Senate questionnaireWhat Happened: Emil Bove, Trump\u2019s former defense lawyer and current DOJ official, refused to denounce the Jan. 6 insurrection or say a third Trump term would violate the Constitution in a Senate questionnaire for his appeals court nomination. He also defended dropping the Eric Adams case, which sparked DOJ resignations.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s answers reveal the growing normalization of Trumpist extremism within the judiciary. His nomination is part of a broader effort to stack the courts with subservients who won\u2019t challenge authoritarian power grabs or follow the law.Source: CBS NewsWhite House reviews mass federal layoff plans, aims for swift actionWhat Happened: Trump is rushing to implement mass federal layoffs following the Supreme Court decision that gave him a green light. Over a dozen agencies, including State and HHS, are set to purge thousands of jobs, with legal challenges expected from unions and civil rights groups.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s planned purge is an erasure of institutional knowledge and a calculated effort to take full control of federal agencies\u2014part of a broader authoritarian agenda to replace seasoned officials with loyalists and consolidate power.Source: ReutersA Half Dozen Trump Officials Hold More Than One Big JobWhat Happened: At least six Trump officials are holding multiple top roles, including Marco Rubio, who now serves as Secretary of State, acting national security adviser, acting archivist, and head of USAID. Others like Russ Vought and Richard Grenell oversee both budget and oversight agencies. Most appointments followed purges of prior leadership.Why It Matters: This is textbook authoritarian power consolidation. Trump is dismantling institutional checks and stacking agencies with loyalists\u2014shrinking government while centralizing control in a tight inner circle.Source: New York TimesState Department cuts broader than anticipated, include diplomatic securityWhat Happened: Over 1,300 State Department employees were issued layoff notices Friday, including civil and foreign service staff in diplomacy, human rights, environmental, migration, and security roles. Some found out via HR portals overnight.Why It Matters: This mass purge guts U.S. diplomatic capacity and signals Trump\u2019s retreat from global engagement\u2014ceding ground to China and Russia. By purging roles tied to human rights and cooperation, the regime is sidelining diplomacy for hardline nationalism and endangering national security.Source: ABC NewsHoman claims ICE officers \u2018don\u2019t need probable cause\u2019 to \u2018briefly detain\u2019 peopleWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, said ICE and Border Patrol don\u2019t need probable cause to detain people briefly\u2014just \u201carticulable facts\u201d like appearance or location. Civil rights groups called the claim false and dangerous, especially amid mass raids in California.Why It Matters: This is legalized racial profiling. Homan is rebranding stop-and-frisk to justify detaining people based on looks\u2014normalizing unconstitutional policing to fuel Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump sues California over egg prices and blames animal welfare lawsWhat Happened: Trump sued California to block its cage-free egg laws, claiming they inflate prices and \u201cviolate\u201d the Constitution by affecting out-of-state producers. California officials say bird flu\u2014not regulation\u2014drove the spike.Why It Matters: Trump continues using federal power to target blue states. By continuing to attack California, he\u2019s escalating his broader campaign to weaponize government against his opponents.Source: Associated PressAttorney General Bondi fired at least 20 officials with ties to Jack Smith investigation: SourcesWhat Happened: Pam Bondi purged at least 20 Justice Department officials tied to former Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigations into Trump. Many were not prosecutors but support staff and U.S. marshals. A DOJ \u201cweaponization working group\u201d led by extremist Ed Martin identified the targets.Why It Matters: By firing career officials over past investigations, Bondi is weaponizing the Justice Department to punish Trump\u2019s critics and erase accountability\u2014just like autocrats do when dismantling the rule of law.Source: ABC NewsHassett says White House probing Fed renovation costs, authority to fire PowellWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s team is probing a $2.5 billion Fed headquarters renovation on possible grounds to fire Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026. Economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump could remove Powell \u201cfor cause.Why It Matters: This is a sham investigation designed to punish Powell for resisting Trump\u2019s demands to slash interest rates. It mirrors tactics used in authoritarian regimes\u2014using invented scandals to purge or prosecute officials.Source: ReutersIRS\u2019s data-sharing deal with ICE will lead to \u2018dangerous\u2019 mistakes, digital rights group arguesWhat Happened: The Electronic Frontier Foundation urged a federal court to block the IRS\u2019s data-sharing deal with ICE, warning it violates tax privacy laws and could trigger wrongful deportations. Trump officials are using bulk IRS data to target undocumented immigrants.Why It Matters: This shatters post-Watergate safeguards meant to prevent government abuse. Sharing sensitive tax records with ICE\u2014especially under AI surveillance\u2014risks sweeping up innocent people and accelerates Trump\u2019s assault on civil liberties and privacy protections.Source: FedScoopTrump's attorney general drops fraud case tied to COVID vaccinationsWhat Happened: Pam Bondi dropped charges against a Utah doctor who destroyed vaccines and issued fake COVID vaccination cards. The doctor had injected minors with saline, but Bondi praised him for offering \u201cchoice\u201d during the pandemic.Why It Matters: This rewards anti-vax fraud and further politicizes the Justice Department. Trump\u2019s DOJ is shielding allies who defied public health laws and endangered lives while targeting his opponents.Source: ReutersICE Set to Vastly Expand Its Reach With New FundsWhat Happened: Trump secured $170 billion to expand ICE and DHS\u2014adding 10,000 agents, more detention centers, AI surveillance, and border wall construction. New taxes target immigrants as mass deportations ramp up nationwide.Why It Matters: This is the infrastructure of a police state, and immigrants are the test case. Trump is building a vast deportation machine with permanent funding, eroding civil rights, enriching private prisons, and turning immigration enforcement into a tool of mass repression.Source: New York TimesMetadata Shows the FBI\u2019s \u2018Raw\u2019 Jeffrey Epstein Prison Video Was Likely ModifiedWhat Happened: Metadata from the FBI\u2019s \u201craw\u201d Epstein prison video reveals it was processed with Adobe Premiere and stitched from multiple clips. Experts say this undermines claims that the footage was untouched. The FBI and DOJ offered no clear explanation, and the footage includes a one-minute gap during a crucial time frame.Why It Matters: In a case shrouded in mistrust, the DOJ\u2019s mishandling of key evidence fuels public suspicion. The altered video raises new questions about Epstein\u2019s death\u2014and further fractures trust in the Justice Department\u2019s official story.Source: WIREDSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump says he\u2019s considering \u2018taking away\u2019 Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s US citizenshipWhat Happened: Trump said he\u2019s \u201cconsidering\u201d taking away Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s citizenship because she\u2019s \u201cnot in the best interests\u201d of the U.S. This would be unconstitutional, as O\u2019Donnell was born in the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump is floating the idea of stripping citizenship as retaliation against a critic\u2014echoing tactics used by dictators to silence dissent. It\u2019s a test balloon for normalizing political persecution in America.Source: Associated PressDOJ Describes Plan To Denaturalize Citizens on Scale That Has Never Been TriedWhat Happened: A leaked DOJ memo reveals a sweeping Trump policy to \u201cmaximally pursue\u201d denaturalization across 10 categories, including fraud, financial crimes, and vague \u201cnational interest\u201d claims. The process is civil\u2014meaning no jury, right to counsel, and time limit\u2014so decades-old errors can cost someone their citizenship.Why It Matters: Trump is creating a system where naturalized citizens will live under permanent threat. It weaponizes civil courts to strip citizenship\u2014undermining equal rights and due process\u2014and will be used to silence critics and punish dissent.Source: TPMTrump authorizes Ice agents to protect themselves using \u2018whatever means\u2019 necessaryWhat Happened: Trump granted ICE agents \u201ctotal authorization\u201d to use \u201cwhatever means necessary\u201d following clashes during immigration raids in California and a shooting in Texas. He ordered arrests of anti-ICE protesters, defied DHS guidance halting workplace raids, and backed aggressive enforcement that led to over 200 arrests and one death.Why It Matters: Trump is turning ICE into a militarized force. Empowered to suppress dissent and operate beyond legal norms, this is a major step toward authoritarian policing under the guise of immigration enforcement.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDetained immigrants at \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 say there are worms in food and wastewater on the floorWhat Happened: Migrants held at Trump\u2019s Everglades internment camp say they face inhumane conditions: food with worms, overflowing sewage, insect swarms, and no medical care or lawyer access. Some say they\u2019re pressured to self-deport. At least one child is detained inside.Why It Matters: The facility\u2014celebrated by Trump as a model\u2014is a legal and human rights nightmare. It exposes the regime\u2019s intent to normalize abuse, secrecy, and human rights violations as tools of immigration enforcement.Source: Associated PressExclusive: Hundreds at Alligator Alcatraz have no criminal charges, Miami Herald learnsWhat Happened: At least 250 people held at Trump\u2019s internment camp have no U.S. criminal convictions or charges, despite officials branding detainees as \u201cvicious\u201d criminals. Many are asylum seekers or migrants detained for civil immigration violations, including traffic stops and ICE check-ins.Why It Matters: This underscores a mass detention system that targets nonviolent immigrants under the guise of public safety. Detaining people without charges or due process mirrors the tactics of authoritarian regimes.Source: Miami HeraldCalifornia farm worker injured in immigration raids dies; More than 300 arrested, feds sayWhat Happened: Over 300 immigrants were arrested during massive ICE and CBP raids on two California cannabis farms, with one farmworker later dying after a fall during the operation. The raid triggered violent clashes, injuries, and a temporary court-ordered halt after the ACLU intervened.Why It Matters: This is state-sponsored terror. Trump\u2019s raids are tearing families apart, brutalizing peaceful workers, and turning legal job sites into militarized zones. A man is dead, children were detained, and citizens were caught in the sweep. Source: CBS NewsDisabled veteran who is a US citizen was taken during Camarillo immigration raid, family saysWhat Happened: George Retes, a 25-year-old disabled veteran and U.S. citizen, was allegedly beaten, pepper-sprayed, and detained by ICE agents during the Camarillo cannabis farm raid. His family says he was trying to leave the area when officers smashed his car window and dragged him out. His whereabouts remain unknown days later.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass raids are disappearing American citizens, including veterans. Retes\u2019 disappearance is a stark example of unchecked federal power\u2014and the terrifying collapse of due process. Disappearing people off the streets is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.Source: ABC 7 Los AngelesTrump says he wants to deport \u2018the worst of the worst.\u2019 Government data tells another storyWhat Happened: Trump says his mass deportation push targets \u201cthe worst of the worst,\u201d but ICE data shows over 70% of detainees have no criminal convictions\u2014and only a tiny share are violent offenders. Arrests of non-criminals surged after Trump imposed daily quotas.Why It Matters: This exposes the deportation campaign as a propaganda tool\u2014not a public safety initiative. Trump\u2019s lies fuel fear, justify sweeping crackdowns and expansion of power, and dehumanize immigrant communities. Immigrants are the test case for a broader assault on civil rights and the stripping of due process protections.Source: Associated PressICE may deport migrants to countries other than their own with just six hours notice, memo saysWhat Happened: A new Trump memo allows ICE to deport migrants to third countries\u2014not their home nations\u2014with as little as six hours\u2019 notice. The change follows a Supreme Court ruling lifting prior legal limits on such removals.Why It Matters: This fast-track deportation policy bypasses basic due process and will send people to unfamiliar and dangerous countries. It's a brutal escalation of Trump\u2019s mass deportation operation\u2014and a threat to legal rights and safety.Source: ReutersN.H. green card holder denied re-entry to U.S. after visiting native CanadaWhat Happened: Chris Landry, a Canadian-born legal U.S. resident of 43 years, was denied re-entry into the U.S. after a family trip to Canada. Border agents cited past minor convictions from over 15 years ago, warning him not to return without facing detention and an immigration judge.Why It Matters: This shows how Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies are targeting even longtime green card holders over decades-old offenses. Families are being torn apart\u2014including those who support him\u2014revealing a system with no regard for stability, contribution, or due process.Source: NBC NewsICE handcuffs 71-year-old grandmother, a U.S. citizen, at San Diego immigration courtWhat Happened: Barbara Stone, a 71-year-old U.S. citizen, was handcuffed and detained for eight hours by ICE agents at a San Diego courthouse after being accused of \u201cpushing\u201d an officer\u2014a charge she denies. Stone was there to observe immigration hearings and support asylum seekers.Why It Matters: This alarming detention of a peaceful elderly woman sends a chilling message to court observers and immigrant advocates and highlights escalating federal intimidation tactics under Trump\u2019s DHS against those defending civil liberties.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDOGE staffer takes on Trump reform role at independent Nuclear Regulatory CommissionWhat Happened: A DOGE operative has been placed inside the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to implement Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at \u201creforming\u201d the independent agency. The staffer, Adam Blake, is overseeing purges and structural changes meant to accelerate nuclear licensing.Why It Matters: This undermines the NRC\u2019s independence and exposes Trump\u2019s drive to seize control of agencies traditionally protected from political meddling. Infiltrating regulators with unvetted loyalists dismantles safeguards and erodes critical checks on executive power.Source: The HillFEMA Didn\u2019t Answer Thousands of Calls From Flood Survivors, Documents ShowWhat Happened: FEMA failed to answer most survivor calls after the Texas floods, with response rates plunging below 20% after Kristi Noem let key call center contracts lapse. She waited five days to renew them, stalling aid.Why It Matters: Noem\u2019s micromanagement paralyzed FEMA\u2019s disaster response. Survivors were left in limbo, highlighting how Trump\u2019s cuts and politicized oversight are crippling basic emergency services.Source: New York TimesFBI Deputy Director Bongino May Resign Over Epstein Files FalloutWhat Happened: Dan Bongino is considering resigning after a blowup with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case. Tensions peaked over missing video footage and public backlash from MAGA allies, who feel the DOJ downplayed Epstein\u2019s death and is withholding the files.Why It Matters: The scandal has exposed deep rifts between Trump\u2019s FBI and DOJ leadership, fueled MAGA conspiracies, and raised doubts about Trump\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d in the MAGA universe.Source: CNNFallout Over Handling of Epstein Case Erupts Into the OpenWhat Happened: Tensions over the Epstein case burst into the open as Pam Bondi accused Dan Bongino of leaking stories blaming her for public backlash. Bongino, once a top Epstein conspiracy promoter, is reportedly considering resignation amid the chaos.Why It Matters: The Epstein case has become a full-blown political liability for Trump. Infighting among top officials reveals more dysfunction at the highest levels, as threats to the U.S. remain high at home and abroad.Source: New York TimesTrump Is Gutting Weather Science and Reducing Disaster ResponseWhat Happened: Trump is gutting FEMA, NOAA, and the National Weather Service\u2014purging staff, closing labs, and cutting billions from climate and disaster programs. Forecasting tools, hurricane data flights, and flood gauges are being defunded, while FEMA grants for resilience and recovery are frozen or eliminated.Why It Matters: As extreme weather intensifies, Trump is tearing down the federal capacity to predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters. Americans will face floods, fires, and storms with fewer warnings, less aid, and no safety net.Source: New York TimesHHS facing billion-dollar backlog of delayed grants after DOGEWhat Happened: HHS has over $1 billion in delayed grants after Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE imposed new bureaucratic hurdles. Purges gutted key staff, forcing HHS to ask some back temporarily. Vital programs for HIV care, migrant children, and Indigenous survivors have been affected.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s war on public services is sabotaging basic government functions. DOGE\u2019s chokehold on funding is delaying aid to vulnerable communities and threatening long-standing federal programs.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s NASA Cuts Would Hurt America for a Long, Long TimeWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s proposed budget slashes NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division by over 50%, threatening satellite missions, climate research, and the training of future scientists. Former NASA leaders warn it would dismantle decades of scientific progress for just 0.03% of federal spending.Why It Matters: These cuts gut U.S. leadership in climate science and space innovation at a time of increasing global crisis. Source: 404 MediaTrump yanks $15m in research into Pfas on US farms: \u2018not just stupid, it\u2019s evil\u2019What Happened: Trump abruptly canceled nearly $15 million in PFAS contamination studies on U.S. farmland, despite evidence that toxic sludge used as fertilizer is tainting crops and water. The move, pushed by Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, halts research into how these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d enter food systems.Why It Matters: Ending PFAS research shields polluters and leaves millions exposed to cancer-linked toxins in food and water. Experts say the decision is \u201cnot just stupid, it\u2019s evil.\u201dSource: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump\u2019s 30 percent tariff threat provokes anger and frustration in EuropeWhat Happened: Trump threatened to impose 30% tariffs on European and Mexican goods starting August 1, derailing trade talks and provoking outrage across the EU. European leaders, led by Ursula von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron, are warning of immediate retaliatory tariffs if no deal is reached.Why It Matters: This escalates the risk of a transatlantic trade war. Trump\u2019s erratic tariff moves will devastate exporters, fuel inflation, and fracture U.S.\u2013EU relations\u2014just as Russia and China seek to divide the West.Source: New York TimesRussia Warns US, South Korea and Japan Against Forming Security Alliance Targeting North KoreaWhat Happened: During a high-level visit to North Korea, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the U.S., South Korea, and Japan against forming a trilateral military alliance. Lavrov defended North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and praised Pyongyang for backing Russia\u2019s genocidal war on Ukraine, including sending troops.Why It Matters: This underscores a dangerous deepening of the Moscow\u2013Pyongyang axis. As Trump weakens U.S. alliances, Russia is strengthening an anti-Western military bloc\u2014one that includes a nuclear-armed North Korea openly supporting Russia\u2019s genocidal war in Europe.Source: Military.comFrance launches criminal investigation into Musk\u2019s X over algorithm manipulationWhat Happened: French prosecutors launched a criminal probe into Musk\u2019s X for alleged algorithm manipulation and illegal data harvesting tied to foreign interference. Complaints accuse the platform of amplifying hateful content to distort France\u2019s democratic debate.Why It Matters: France\u2019s investigation adds legal firepower to EU efforts under the Digital Services Act to hold Musk accountable for fueling extremism and destabilizing elections, something the U.S. should have done.Source: Politico\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchSenate panel approves $500M of Ukraine aidWhat Happened: The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a $500 million defense package for Ukraine in the 2026 defense bill, extending the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through 2028. The vote passed 26\u20131, amid growing Russian genocidal aggression and renewed NATO coordination.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s hostility toward Ukraine, this would signal a tactical pivot\u2014though actions speak louder than words. NATO\u2019s missile deployments and rising defense budgets show the West bracing for prolonged conflict with Russia.Source: The HillTrump-whisperer Laura Loomer sharpens her knives for Pam BondiWhat Happened: Far-right influencer Laura Loomer is demanding that Pam Bondi resign over her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein probe. Loomer claims Bondi created a PR crisis by failing to release Epstein\u2019s so-called \u201cclient list,\u201d stirring outrage among MAGA supporters and allegedly clashing with top DOJ officials.Why It Matters: The MAGA base is ramping up its attacks on Bondi, revealing fractures inside Trump\u2019s inner circle. Loomer\u2019s influence shows how conspiracy-driven loyalty tests are reshaping power dynamics in Trump\u2019s world.Source: PoliticoTrump faces a revolt from his MAGA base over the Epstein filesWhat Happened: There was backlash at a Turning Point summit after Trump defended Pam Bondi on Truth Social and downplayed Epstein revelations, despite a DOJ memo claiming no client list or blackmail evidence. Why It Matters: After years of hyping Epstein disclosures, Trump is now seen by parts of his base as covering up for Epstein\u2014fueling backlash, betrayal, and growing rebellion within the MAGA movement.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsVietnam Surprised by Trump Tariff Decision, Seeks Lower RateWhat Happened: Trump blindsided Vietnam with a 20% tariff\u2014double what they expected. Vietnam is still pushing for a lower rate, while scrambling to meet U.S. demands on Chinese transshipments without angering Beijing.Why It Matters: The move highlights Trump\u2019s erratic trade policy and signals broader chaos as Trump plans blanket tariffs on more countries.Source: BloombergTrump announces 30% tariffs against EU, Mexico to begin Aug. 1, rattling major US trading partnersWhat Happened: Trump announced 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, set to begin Aug. 1, blaming \u201cunfair trade\u201d and accusing Mexico of failing to stop fentanyl and migration. Why It Matters: These tariffs will upend U.S. relations with key allies and rattle global markets. Trump\u2019s escalating trade war risks economic fallout at home and deepens diplomatic rifts abroad.Source: Associated PressUnder Attack by Trump\u2019s Tariffs, Asian Countries Seek Out Better FriendsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariff threats have shaken Asian economies, prompting countries like South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia to pursue new trade deals and alliances. Some are fast-tracking regional agreements, increasing bilateral trade, and reducing reliance on the U.S. as a dominant buyer.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s escalating tariffs risk isolating the U.S. and weakening long-standing alliances.

He also defended dropping the Eric Adams case, which sparked DOJ resignations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Bove\\u2019s answers reveal the growing normalization of Trumpist extremism within the judiciary.

Over a dozen agencies, including State and HHS, are set to purge thousands of jobs, with legal challenges expected from unions and civil rights groups.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s planned purge is an erasure of institutional knowledge and a calculated effort to take full control of federal agencies\\u2014part of a broader authoritarian agenda to replace seasoned officials with loyalists and consolidate power.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/white-house-reviews-mass-federal-layoff-plans-aims-swift-action-2025-07-11/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>A Half Dozen Trump Officials Hold More Than One Big Job</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> At least six Trump officials are holding multiple top roles, including Marco Rubio, who now serves as Secretary of State, acting national security adviser, acting archivist, and head of USAID. Others like Russ Vought and Richard Grenell oversee both budget and oversight agencies. Most appointments followed purges of prior leadership.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is textbook authoritarian power consolidation.

Trump officials are using bulk IRS data to target undocumented immigrants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shatters post-Watergate safeguards meant to prevent government abuse.

New taxes target immigrants as mass deportations ramp up nationwide.</p><p>Why It Matters: This is the infrastructure of a police state, and immigrants are the test case.

Experts say this undermines claims that the footage was untouched. The FBI and DOJ offered no clear explanation, and the footage includes a one-minute gap during a crucial time frame.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> In a case shrouded in mistrust, the DOJ\\u2019s mishandling of key evidence fuels public suspicion.

The raid triggered violent clashes, injuries, and a temporary court-ordered halt after the ACLU intervened.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is state-sponsored terror.

His family says he was trying to leave the area when officers smashed his car window and dragged him out. His whereabouts remain unknown days later.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s mass raids are disappearing American citizens, including veterans.
