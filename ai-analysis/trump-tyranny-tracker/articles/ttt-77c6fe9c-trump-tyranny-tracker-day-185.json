REUTERS/Jeenah MoonShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 23Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 9Google Meet: July 29, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption News\u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Investment Fund Seals Deal for Japan and Expands Trump\u2019s InfluenceWhat Happened: As part of a trade agreement, Japan will create a $550 billion investment fund that Trump will personally control, channeling funds into U.S. sectors like semiconductors and shipbuilding. The U.S. will take 90% of the fund\u2019s profits.Why It Matters: Trump is bypassing institutions to seize direct control over foreign capital, blurring diplomacy with personal power and steering billions toward politically favored industries.Source: New York TimesUS House Democrats raise concerns about T-Mobile role in Trump Mobile serviceWhat Happened: House Democrats are investigating T-Mobile\u2019s role in powering Trump Mobile, a new $499 smartphone service branded by the Trump Organization. Lawmakers cite ethical concerns over potential conflicts of interest during Trump\u2019s presidency.Why It Matters: The deal raises red flags about presidential self-enrichment and undue corporate influence. T-Mobile recently secured FCC approvals after dropping DEI policies\u2014prompting concerns of a quid pro quo with Trump.Source: ReutersTrump administration to supercharge AI sales to allies, loosen environmental rulesWhat Happened: Trump launched an AI initiative to boost exports, roll back Biden-era protections, and fast-track data center construction by weakening environmental rules. He signed 3 executive orders and vowed to \u201cwin the AI race\u201d against China.Why It Matters: This greenlights AI militarization and Big Tech dominance. Trump\u2019s plan prioritizes geopolitical rivalry over safety, consumer rights, and climate protections\u2014marking a dramatic erosion of U.S. regulatory oversight.Source: ReutersAs Palantir Cashes In on Trump 2.0, Peter Thiel Is Bankrolling Republicans AgainWhat Happened: Peter Thiel has quietly resumed political donations, giving over $850,000 to help Republicans hold the House. The move coincides with a surge in Palantir\u2019s stock, fueled by lucrative government contracts\u2014including ICE tracking platforms and a $1.3 billion Pentagon AI deal.Why It Matters: As Palantir helps build Trump\u2019s surveillance state, Thiel is bankrolling the GOP to block Democratic investigations and shield his company from oversight. It's influence-buying with massive national security stakes.Source: Mother Jones17 White House aides hold up to $2.25 million in Big Oil stocksWhat Happened: 17 senior Trump White House officials hold between $820,000 and $2.25 million in oil and gas stocks, according to new financial disclosures analyzed by CREW. Some aides hold up to $750,000 in Chevron or ExxonMobil. At least one official received a certificate to divest but has not yet done so.Why It Matters: As Trump delivers major wins to Big Oil, his top aides are personally profiting. The overlap of policymaking and oil holdings exposes deep conflicts of interest at the heart of the regime.Source: CREW\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s AI Action Plan Is a Crusade Against \u2018Bias\u2019\u2014and RegulationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new AI Action Plan calls for sweeping deregulation, favors Big Tech growth, and targets so-called \u201cideological bias\u201d in AI systems. It urges federal agencies to limit state oversight, scraps Biden-era consumer protections, and ties government contracts to companies that reject \u201cwoke\u201d AI.Why It Matters: The plan prioritizes profit and political loyalty over safety and civil rights. It hands unchecked power to Silicon Valley giants while weaponizing AI policy\u2014accelerating corporate dominance, authoritarian control, and state-sponsored propaganda. With AI now enlisted to shape public opinion, the line between information and manipulation is vanishing.Source: WIREDFar beyond Harvard, conservative efforts to reshape higher education are gaining steamWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s assault on Harvard is part of a wider GOP push to control public universities. Republican officials in states like Indiana, Florida, and Texas are replacing boards, cutting DEI programs, and restricting academic freedom.Why It Matters: This is a nationwide effort to politicize higher education, enforce ideological conformity, silence dissent, and reshape universities into conservative strongholds\u2014undermining academic independence. Trump continues weaponizing federal power to transform universities.Source: Associated Press GOP House members want to run in other races. Trump is telling them to stay in their seatsWhat Happened: Trump is pressuring Republican House members not to run for Senate or governor, urging them to stay in their current seats to protect the GOP\u2019s slim House majority. In recent weeks, Reps. Bill Huizenga, Mike Lawler, and Zach Nunn all dropped bids for higher office after private meetings with Trump.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s grip on the GOP remains ironclad. By micromanaging the 2026 midterms, he\u2019s trying to avoid loss of power and ensure total control of Congress.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsIn Seeking More on Epstein, Justice Dept.\u2019s No. 2 Official Occupies Unusual RoleWhat Happened: Deputy AG Todd Blanche, formerly Trump\u2019s defense lawyer, is now handling the Ghislaine Maxwell case. He filed court documents using his old law firm\u2019s address and is negotiating directly with Maxwell\u2019s attorney\u2014his personal friend\u2014after the DOJ fired lead Epstein prosecutor Maurene Comey.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the Justice Department to protect himself. By using Blanche, he\u2019s turning a high-profile sex trafficking case into a political shield\u2014erasing the line between public duty and personal loyalty to cover up the truth.Source: New York TimesAttorney General Told Trump His Name Is in Epstein FilesWhat Happened: Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche briefed Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein files. Trump has publicly denied being informed. The DOJ later declared the investigation closed\u2014claiming no further prosecutions were warranted and no \u201cclient list\u201d existed.Why It Matters: The abrupt closure after Trump learned his name was implicated underscores political interference and a coverup. It\u2019s a clear case of weaponizing justice to shield Trump and bury the case.Source: New York TimesGabbard uses surprise White House appearance to attack Trump\u2019s enemies on the Russia investigationWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard accused Obama of plotting a \u201ccoup\u201d against Trump over Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, presenting unverified claims in a surprise White House appearance. Trump promoted her remarks, and DOJ launched a \u201cstrike force\u201d based on her referral.Why It Matters: Gabbard is rewriting U.S. intelligence to echo Trump\u2019s lies, politicizing national security and laying the groundwork for prosecutions of political opponents\u2014undermining trust with allies and democratic institutions.Source: Associated PressJustice Department to assess claims of 'alleged weaponization' of US intelligence communityWhat Happened: The DOJ is forming a \u201cstrike force\u201d to investigate Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s claims that Obama officials \u201cweaponized\u201d U.S. intelligence in 2016 to sabotage Trump. Gabbard declassified documents and accused top Democrats of a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d\u2014allegations Trump amplified while calling Obama a \u201ctraitor.\u201d No evidence has been presented.Why It Matters: This is a classic authoritarian tactic. Trump and Gabbard are using the DOJ to rewrite history to punish those who exposed Russia\u2019s election interference. The real threat isn\u2019t past intel work\u2014it\u2019s the criminalization of truth and the politicization of national security.Source: ReutersBondi Fires Newly Appointed New Jersey Prosecutor in Clash With JudgesWhat Happened: Pam Bondi fired Desiree Grace, the judges\u2019 pick to replace Trump ally Alina Habba as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, after the court declined to extend Habba\u2019s interim role. Habba, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, had launched partisan probes into Democrats during her brief tenure.Why It Matters: DOJ is attacking judicial independence to install loyalists. By overruling court decisions and politicizing prosecutions, they\u2019re dismantling the rule of law and continue to weaponize justice for partisan gain.Source: Wall Street JournalNJ law banning immigration detention contracts overturned by US appeals courtWhat Happened: A federal appeals court struck down New Jersey\u2019s 2021 law banning contracts for immigration detention, allowing private prison firm CoreCivic to keep operating the Elizabeth Detention Center. Why It Matters: The decision limits state power to resist federal immigration enforcement, expanding Trump\u2019s ability to grow detention networks and bypass local opposition to ICE operations.Source: Associated PressDOJ meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell set for Thursday: SourcesWhat Happened: Deputy AG Todd Blanche is set to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, following Trump\u2019s directive to \u201crelease all credible evidence\u201d in the Epstein case. Why It Matters: This reeks of a quid pro quo to shield Trump. Blanche\u2014Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer\u2014is leading a secretive meeting with a convicted sex trafficker, raising fears that Maxwell may be offered a pardon in exchange for silence or deflection. It\u2019s a despicable abuse of power to cover up the sex trafficking of over 1,000 children.Source: ABC NewsTrump violated law in delaying US Head Start education funding, GAO report findsWhat Happened: A GAO report found that Trump violated federal law by freezing nearly $1 billion in Head Start early education funding. The delay lasted until April and disrupted services for low-income families.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk\u2019s freeze shut down programs, caused layoffs, and left 800,000 kids and families without support. It\u2019s a ruthless attack on the most vulnerable, all to concentrate power.Source: ReutersTexas' Fort Bliss Set to Host 5,000-Bed Immigrant Detention CampWhat Happened: Trump awarded a $1.26 billion contract to build a massive 5,000-bed immigrant detention facility at Fort Bliss, Texas\u2014with $232 million coming directly from Army funds. The facility will be ICE-run but built and overseen by the military.Why It Matters: This escalates the militarization of immigration enforcement. Trump is diverting military resources to expand internment camps\u2014fueling human rights abuses with no oversight or accountability.Source: Military.com and Texas TribuneHarvard under investigation over participation in visa program for foreign students and researchersWhat Happened: The State Department is investigating whether Harvard can remain in a U.S. visa program for foreign students and researchers. It\u2019s the latest in a string of retaliatory actions after Harvard rejected Trump\u2019s demands and sued over his $2.6 billion in federal funding cuts.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating efforts to punish Harvard, threatening its ability to host international students and its tax-exempt status. This political retaliation endangers academic freedom and U.S. global leadership.Source: Associated PressSupreme Court Lets Trump Fire Consumer Product Safety RegulatorsWhat Happened: The Supreme Court allowed Trump to fire 3 Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, despite laws shielding them from removal without cause. The unsigned emergency order aligns with recent decisions giving Trump sweeping control over independent agencies, overriding a 90-year precedent.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling bipartisan safeguards to seize total control of regulatory bodies. This ruling guts agency independence, empowers Trump to purge dissenters, and marks another step toward executive dominance\u2014echoing authoritarian tactics to eliminate all checks on power.Source: New York TimesJustice Department Prepares Crackdown on Trump Tariff ViolatorsWhat Happened: The Justice Department is preparing criminal charges against companies and individuals accused of evading Trump\u2019s tariffs. A new unit is being staffed to target trade fraud, including underreporting, country mislabeling, and supply chain deception\u2014violations that were previously handled with civil fines.Why It Matters: Trump is using the DOJ to enforce his economic agenda with threats of criminal prosecution. This shift escalates trade policy into criminal territory\u2014which will fuel fear and chaos across global supply chains.Source: BloombergSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsAppeals court won\u2019t reinstate AP access to presidential eventsWhat Happened: A federal appeals court denied the Associated Press\u2019s request to regain full access to Trump's presidential events while its lawsuit proceeds. The AP was banned in February after refusing to adopt Trump\u2019s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico.Why It Matters: The ruling gives Trump a green light to punish critical media by restricting access\u2014chilling press freedom and gutting First Amendment protections. It\u2019s another step toward authoritarian control of information.Source: Associated PressFar beyond Harvard, conservative efforts to reshape higher education are gaining steamWhat Happened: Beyond headline harassment of Harvard, Trump-aligned officials are reshaping higher education nationwide\u2014banning DEI programs, replacing trustees, and seizing control over curricula. States like Indiana, Florida, and Ohio have gutted faculty power and defunded progressive initiatives.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated campaign to seize control of universities, silence dissent, and dictate what students can learn. It\u2019s an assault on academic freedom and a dangerous step toward indoctrination.Source: Associated PressHouse Oversight subcommittee takes step to subpoena Justice Dept. for Epstein filesWhat Happened: A House Oversight subcommittee voted to subpoena the DOJ for Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s files, with bipartisan support.

The move comes amid FCC scrutiny, CBS\u2019s $16 million donation to Trump\u2019s foundation, and the axing of Stephen Colbert\u2019s show.Why It Matters: Trump is reshaping media through mergers and pressure campaigns. Promises of \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d mask efforts to purge dissent and enforce ideological loyalty\u2014threatening press freedom and accelerating the capture of major news outlets.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsEducation Department Will Investigate Scholarships for DACA StudentsWhat Happened: Trump officials launched civil rights investigations into five universities for offering scholarships to DACA recipients, claiming these programs discriminate against U.S.-born students. Why It Matters: By twisting civil rights law, Trump\u2019s Education Department is targeting DACA recipients\u2014using legal pretense to strip them of financial aid and deny them access to higher education.Source: New York TimesFamily, supporters urge release of Spanish-language journalist in ICE custodyWhat Happened: Mario Guevara, a longtime Spanish-language journalist in Atlanta, was arrested while covering a protest and later detained by ICE. Though a judge granted him bond, ICE blocked his release, citing \u201cpublic safety.\u201dWhy It Matters: Guevara\u2019s detention raises alarm about press freedom and retaliation. He was visibly identified as media and has legal status, yet now sits in isolation for documenting immigration enforcement.Source: Associated PressLawyers say Venezuelan migrant ordered returned to US sent to home country under prisoner exchangeWhat Happened: A Venezuelan migrant known as Cristian was disappeared to El Salvador, then sent to Venezuela last week as part of a U.S. prisoner exchange\u2014despite a federal judge\u2019s order to return him to the U.S. His lawyers now can\u2019t locate him and say the deportation violated a legal settlement protecting asylum seekers.Why It Matters: Cristian\u2019s case exposes Trump\u2019s continued defiance of court orders and erosion of due process. By using a vulnerable asylum seeker as a bargaining chip, the U.S. is not only breaking legal agreements\u2014it\u2019s abandoning its obligations under international law.Source: Associated PressVenezuelan makeup artist returns home, describes torture during El Salvador detentionWhat Happened: Andry Hernandez, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist, was disappeared and spent months in El Salvador\u2019s gulag. U.S. officials accused him of \u201cgang affiliation\u201d due to tattoos\u2014without evidence. Hernandez says he was tortured, abused, and sexually assaulted in custody.Why It Matters: Hernandez was denied due process despite having a pending asylum claim. His treatment shows how Trump is weaponizing emergency power to disappear vulnerable people\u2014 while violating human rights.Source: ReutersVenezuela's Returning Migrants Allege Abuses in El Salvador's 'Hell' Prison Where US Sent ThemWhat Happened: Venezuelan migrants who were disappeared say they were tortured in El Salvador\u2019s gulag, where the U.S. paid $6 million to detain them as suspected \u201cgang members\u201d\u2014often based on tattoos alone. Many were later freed and repatriated in a U.S.-Venezuela prisoner swap.Why It Matters: Migrants allege beatings, rape, and psychological torture in a facility notorious for abuse. Trump and his officials are committing grave human rights violations and need to be held accountable.Source: Military.comSeizure of Former Afghan US Translator from Connecticut Threatens National Security, Vets SayWhat Happened: Zia, an Afghan translator granted a U.S. visa for aiding American forces, was seized by masked ICE agents in Connecticut while attending a routine appointment. He has no criminal record, a pending green card, and a family\u2014but is now detained in Massachusetts without explanation.Why It Matters: If Zia is sent back, he\u2019ll be executed for helping U.S. forces. Detaining trusted partners sends a brutal message: America breaks its promises and abandons those who risked their lives for us.Source: Military.comU.S. Quietly Drafts Plan to End Program That Saved Millions From AIDSWhat Happened: Leaked State Department documents show Trump plans to dismantle PEPFAR, the global HIV/AIDS relief program, and replace it with a stripped-down model focused on disease detection and U.S. pharmaceutical exports.Why It Matters: This is a humanitarian betrayal. Trump plans to end a program that saved 26 million lives, replacing it with a profit-driven model. Millions will die as America abandons global health leadership.Source: New York TimesFlorida attorney general investigating restaurant that hosted LGBTQ Pride eventWhat Happened: Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier subpoenaed Vero Beach Vice Mayor Linda Moore over a Pride event with drag performers at her wine bar. The state claims it may have violated laws barring children from \"adult\" performances, despite courts having blocked enforcement of the law since 2023.Why It Matters: By targeting a local official over a family-friendly Pride event, the state is using subpoenas and vague legal threats to attack the LGBTQ+ community and intimidate political opponents.Source: The HillVideo reveals conditions in Manhattan immigration court holding cellsWhat Happened: Footage obtained by the New York Immigration Coalition shows asylum-seekers packed into ICE holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza\u2014some held for up to two weeks\u2014sleeping on the floor with limited food, no medical care, and no change of clothes. The facility was originally meant for brief detentions.Why It Matters: This is more evidence that ICE is detaining legal asylum applicants in inhumane, jail-like conditions, in clear violation of basic rights. The abuse is systemic and part of a broader campaign of cruelty.Source: The HillEswatini opposition attacks US deal as \u2018human trafficking disguised as deportation\u2019What Happened: The U.S. quietly deported five foreign nationals convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini under a secretive third-country deal. They are held in solitary confinement with U.S. funding, sparking protests and outrage from local opposition and civil society.Why It Matters: Critics call the pact \u201chuman trafficking disguised as deportation,\u201d warning it endangers human rights, lacks transparency, and turns Eswatini into a prison for U.S. deportees.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Signal messages came from email classified \u2018SECRET,\u2019 watchdog toldWhat Happened: The Pentagon inspector general uncovered that Pete Hegseth\u2019s Signal messages about U.S. operations in Yemen were based on a classified \u201cSECRET/NOFORN\u201d email. The intel was shared in group chats, one of which included a journalist\u2014contradicting claims from Trump officials that no classified information was involved.Why It Matters: More evidence that Hegseth and other Trump officials committed a serious breach of national security. Trump\u2019s team downplayed what may be one of the most reckless disclosures of his regime\u2014potentially violating federal law and putting lives at risk.Source: Washington PostUS Justice Dept civil rights unit faces mass exodusWhat Happened: Since Trump returned to office, 368 staff have left the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division amid a radical shift in mission. Trump appointee Harmeet Dhillon has redirected the office away from traditional civil rights enforcement toward targeting DEI policies and trans rights.Why It Matters: The mass exodus signals the collapse of one of America\u2019s key civil rights watchdogs. Longstanding efforts to protect marginalized groups are being dismantled\u2014and replaced with prosecutions that advance Trump\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: ReutersTrump canceled a $4.9B loan guarantee for a line to deliver green powerWhat Happened: Trump revoked a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, a major transmission line meant to deliver wind and solar power from the Midwest to the East Coast. The Department of Energy claimed the project wasn\u2019t critical to national interests.Why It Matters: Canceling support for the largest clean power line in the U.S. deals a major blow to renewable energy expansion, weakens grid reliability, and underscores a return to fossil fuel\u2014despite skyrocketing power demand and electricity costs.Source: Associated PressUS ends use of flu shots with thimerosal in latest move by health secretary KennedyWhat Happened: RFK Jr. ended U.S. distribution of flu vaccines containing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. Though only 5% of last season\u2019s doses included it and studies show no safety risk, Kennedy cited long-standing conspiracy claims linking it to autism\u2014despite FDA assurances to the contrary.Why It Matters: Kennedy continues reshaping national vaccine policy based on debunked conspiracy theories, sidelining scientific consensus, and undermining trust in immunization programs.Source: ReutersTrump EPA will propose repealing finding that climate change endangers public healthWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s EPA is preparing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding that legally declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health. This landmark Obama-era decision enabled the government to regulate emissions from vehicles and power plants. EPA chief Lee Zeldin confirmed the plan, calling climate regulations \u201ctrillions worth of overreach.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is erasing the government\u2019s ability to fight the climate crisis. By scrapping the legal foundation for carbon rules, he\u2019s locking in pollution, sabotaging future action, and continuing his war on science and public health.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchVon der Leyen Says EU-China Ties Are at \u2018Inflection Point\u2019What Happened: At a tense summit in Beijing, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Xi Jinping that EU-China ties are at an \u201cinflection point.\u201d The EU pressed China on trade imbalances, support for Russia, and rare earth restrictions\u2014while talks ended early without a joint statement.Why It Matters: Europe\u2019s frustration with China is growing, fueled by trade tensions and Beijing\u2019s backing of Putin. As Trump\u2019s tariffs strain transatlantic ties, the EU is reevaluating its global alliances.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchDeferring to Trump, Senate Pulls Back on New Russia SanctionsWhat Happened: A bipartisan Senate bill to sanction Russia has been shelved after Trump said he would \u201chandle\u201d Putin directly, demanding a cease-fire within 50 days. Despite overwhelming Senate support, GOP leaders delayed the bill targeting Russian oil and its trade with China and India.Why It Matters: Congress continues to surrender its authority, letting Trump control domestic and foreign policy unilaterally. As Ukraine faces escalating genocidal attacks, lawmakers are enabling Trump to provide cover to Putin.Source: New York TimesFox News has mentioned Obama over 3 times more than Epstein since Tulsi Gabbard released her reportWhat Happened: Since Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s report accusing Obama officials of \u201ctreason,\u201d Fox News has mentioned Obama 445 times\u2014over three times more than Jeffrey Epstein, despite renewed scrutiny of Trump\u2019s Epstein ties. Why It Matters: Fox is echoing Trump\u2019s strategy\u2014reviving old enemies to distract from the Epstein scandal. The skewed coverage reveals a coordinated effort to bury a sex trafficking case to shield Trump.Source: Media MattersThe GOP's Message for Tech Billionaires: Be Like Peter ThielWhat Happened: As Elon Musk faces mounting criticism, Republicans are gravitating toward Peter Thiel\u2014whose firm Palantir quietly powers Trump\u2019s surveillance state. Thiel funds GOP campaigns while avoiding Musk-style theatrics.Why It Matters: The GOP\u2019s embrace of Thiel\u2019s model shows how the party is formalizing an alliance with tech oligarchs who fund their agenda and build the surveillance tools to enforce it. This isn\u2019t just cronyism\u2014it\u2019s the architecture of authoritarianism.Source: WIREDThe nefarious message behind the DHS \u2018manifest destiny\u2019 painting: \u2018four pillars of propaganda\u2019What Happened: The Department of Homeland Security posted a 2020 painting of white settlers titled A Prayer for a New Life, captioned \u201cRemember your Homeland\u2019s Heritage.\u201d Critics say the image\u2014shared amid mass immigration raids\u2014glorifies white nationalism and echoes fascist propaganda.Why It Matters: Experts warn the post is part of a broader strategy to evoke nostalgia, erase Indigenous and immigrant histories, and stir extremist far-right sentiment. DHS says it\u2019s \u201cproud of American heritage\u201d\u2014but the message is exclusionary and dangerous.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsUS existing home sales hit nine-month low in JuneWhat Happened: U.S. home sales fell 2.7% in June, hitting their lowest level since September 2024. With mortgage rates near 7% and median prices at a record $435,300, buyers are backing off despite a 16% rise in supply.Why It Matters: The sluggish housing market is weighing on the economy. Trump blamed Fed Chair Powell for high rates and floated a capital gains tax cut to revive sales\u2014injecting politics into an already fragile sector.Source: ReutersUS automakers say Trump\u2019s 15% tariff deal with Japan puts them at a disadvantageWhat Happened: Trump agreed to a 15% tariff on Japanese vehicles\u2014lower than the 25% he had threatened. U.S. automakers and unions say it gives Japan an edge, while American manufacturers still face steep costs under other Trump trade rules.Why It Matters: Trump is calling it a win, but industry leaders see a betrayal.

The U.S. will take 90% of the fund\\u2019s profits.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is bypassing institutions to seize direct control over foreign capital, blurring diplomacy with personal power and steering billions toward politically favored industries.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/business/economy/japan-fund-trump-tariffs-trade.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>US House Democrats raise concerns about T-Mobile role in Trump Mobile service</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Democrats are investigating T-Mobile\\u2019s role in powering Trump Mobile, a new $499 smartphone service branded by the Trump Organization. Lawmakers cite ethical concerns over potential conflicts of interest during Trump\\u2019s presidency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The deal raises red flags about presidential self-enrichment and undue corporate influence. T-Mobile recently secured FCC approvals after dropping DEI policies\\u2014prompting concerns of a quid pro quo with Trump.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-house-democrats-raise-concerns-about-t-mobile-role-trump-mobile-service-2025-07-23/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump administration to supercharge AI sales to allies, loosen environmental rules</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump launched an AI initiative to boost exports, roll back Biden-era protections, and fast-track data center construction by weakening environmental rules. He signed 3 executive orders and vowed to \\u201Cwin the AI race\\u201D against China.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This greenlights AI militarization and Big Tech dominance. Trump\\u2019s plan prioritizes geopolitical rivalry over safety, consumer rights, and climate protections\\u2014marking a dramatic erosion of U.S. regulatory oversight.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-supercharge-ai-sales-allies-loosen-environmental-rules-2025-07-23/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>As Palantir Cashes In on Trump 2.0, Peter Thiel Is Bankrolling Republicans Again</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Peter Thiel has quietly resumed political donations, giving over $850,000 to help Republicans hold the House. The move coincides with a surge in Palantir\\u2019s stock, fueled by lucrative government contracts\\u2014including ICE tracking platforms and a $1.3 billion Pentagon AI deal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As Palantir helps build Trump\\u2019s surveillance state, Thiel is bankrolling the GOP to block Democratic investigations and shield his company from oversight. It's influence-buying with massive national security stakes.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/peter-thiel-republican-donations-palantir-federal-contracts-house-control-trump/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>17 White House aides hold up to $2.25 million in Big Oil stocks</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> 17 senior Trump White House officials hold between $820,000 and $2.25 million in oil and gas stocks, according to new financial disclosures analyzed by CREW. Some aides hold up to $750,000 in Chevron or ExxonMobil. At least one official received a certificate to divest but has not yet done so.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As Trump delivers major wins to Big Oil, his top aides are personally profiting. The overlap of policymaking and oil holdings exposes deep conflicts of interest at the heart of the regime.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/17-white-house-aides-hold-up-to-2-25-million-in-big-oil-stocks/\\\\\\\">CREW</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump\\u2019s AI Action Plan Is a Crusade Against \\u2018Bias\\u2019\\u2014and Regulation</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s new AI Action Plan calls for sweeping deregulation, favors Big Tech growth, and targets so-called \\u201Cideological bias\\u201D in AI systems. It urges federal agencies to limit state oversight, scraps Biden-era consumer protections, and ties government contracts to companies that reject \\u201Cwoke\\u201D AI.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The plan prioritizes profit and political loyalty over safety and civil rights. It hands unchecked power to Silicon Valley giants while weaponizing AI policy\\u2014accelerating corporate dominance, authoritarian control, and state-sponsored propaganda. With AI now enlisted to shape public opinion, the line between information and manipulation is vanishing.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-ai-action-plan-crusade-against-bias-regulation/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Far beyond Harvard, conservative efforts to reshape higher education are gaining steam</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s assault on Harvard is part of a wider GOP push to control public universities. Republican officials in states like Indiana, Florida, and Texas are replacing boards, cutting DEI programs, and restricting academic freedom.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a nationwide effort to politicize higher education, enforce ideological conformity, silence dissent, and reshape universities into conservative strongholds\\u2014undermining academic independence.

Trump is telling them to stay in their seats</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is pressuring Republican House members not to run for Senate or governor, urging them to stay in their current seats to protect the GOP\\u2019s slim House majority. In recent weeks, Reps. Bill Huizenga, Mike Lawler, and Zach Nunn all dropped bids for higher office after private meetings with Trump.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s grip on the GOP remains ironclad.
