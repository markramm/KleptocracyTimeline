  "content": "Representative Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat, protests against Doge on 25 February. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 25Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk\u2019s Starlink Lands FAA ContractWhat Happened: The FAA awarded SpaceX\u2019s Starlink a contract to modernize its air traffic control communications, despite Elon Musk\u2019s role in gutting agencies, canceling contracts, and purging federal workers\u2014including at the FAA. The contract, which could include 4,000 terminals over 12-18 months, follows Musk\u2019s claim that the FAA\u2019s existing Verizon system \u201cis not working\u201d and endangers travelers.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unelected position in the government while securing lucrative federal contracts for his companies highlights serious ethical concerns and corruption. Watchdogs warn of a \u201ccharade\u201d where Musk, as a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d avoids financial disclosures while influencing policy in ways that directly benefit his businesses, including future space mining ventures.Source: CNNTrump Unveils \u2018Gold Card\u2019 Visa for Wealthy InvestorsWhat Happened: Trump proposed a new \u201cGold Card\u201d visa program granting residency and a path to citizenship for foreign investors\u2014including Russian oligarchs he specifically mentioned\u2014who pay $5 million. The initiative, set to launch in two weeks, replaces the EB-5 visa program and, according to Trump, does not require congressional approval.Why It Matters: While Trump escalates his crackdown on undocumented migrants, he is openly selling U.S. residency to the ultra-rich. This blatant pay-to-play scheme prioritizes oligarchs and billionaires while shutting the door on those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum.Source: BloombergTrump Staffers Keep Private Clients While Shaping PolicyWhat Happened: Key Trump officials, including Elon Musk and top aides, are operating as \"Special Government Employees,\u201d allowing them to work for both the government and private clients. These SGEs, exempt from public financial disclosures, influence federal policy while maintaining ties to corporations, lobbying firms, and foreign-backed entities.Why It Matters: The blurred lines between public service and private business create massive conflicts of interest and endanger national security. Musk, overseeing government restructuring while leading Tesla and SpaceX, and others with deep corporate ties highlight corruption and private enrichment at the expense of transparency.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s SEC Pick Built Career Defending Corporations From RegulatorsWhat Happened: Paul Atkins, Trump\u2019s nominee for SEC chairman, has a history of defending corporations against regulatory enforcement. As a consultant, he has worked for major Wall Street firms, including AT&T and SAC Capital, often arguing that companies did not violate financial regulations. His role will lead to a rollback of SEC enforcement on issues like cryptocurrency and environmental disclosures.Why It Matters: Atkins\u2019s deep ties to the financial sector raise serious conflict-of-interest concerns. His history of advocating for companies facing SEC scrutiny highlights Trump\u2019s plans for deregulation and weaker corporate oversight, favoring Wall Street over investors and his billionaire cronies.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s Ukraine Mineral Deal Seen as \u2018Protection Racket\u2019 DiplomacyWhat Happened: Trump is pressuring Ukraine to hand over a portion of its mineral revenues in exchange for continued U.S. support against Russia. The deal offers no explicit security guarantees.Why It Matters: This transactional approach marks a radical departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy, and is an extortion scheme rather than an alliance. This will undermine trust among allies and signals to adversaries that Trump will gladly sacrifice strategic commitments for economic gain.Source: The New York TimesLawmakers Warn China Could Leverage Musk to Influence TrumpWhat Happened: Bipartisan leaders of the House Select Committee on China warned that Beijing may use Elon Musk\u2019s business interests in China to shape U.S. policy through his close relationship with Trump. Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s deep ties to China\u2014through Tesla and other ventures\u2014make him a potential conduit for Beijing to bypass hardline China hawks in Trump\u2019s regime. Lawmakers fear Trump may put key U.S. interests, like support for Taiwan, on the table in future negotiations with Xi Jinping.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDOGE Developing AI to Automate Mass FiringsWhat Happened: Elon Musk is modifying AutoRIF, a Defense Department program, to automate mass government firings. Internal records show Musk operatives actively editing the software, with ex-Tesla engineer Riccardo Biasini leading the effort.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are fast-tracking an AI-powered purge, gutting the federal workforce with mass firings that bypass due process, turning civil service into a political loyalty test.Source: WIREDTrump Puts Don Jr.\u2019s Hunting Buddy in Charge of U.S. Food SafetyWhat Happened: Trump appointed Kyle Diamantas, a Florida attorney and Don Jr.\u2019s hunting pal, as acting deputy commissioner for human foods at the FDA, overseeing 80% of the U.S. food supply without Senate confirmation. His appointment follows mass firings at the FDA and the resignation of its food safety chief.Why It Matters: Trump prioritizes loyalty over expertise, which will endanger food safety, especially as the U.S. grapples with bird flu and a deadly Listeria outbreak.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Large-Scale Federal Workforce Cuts Enter Next PhaseWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime has begun notifying employees across multiple agencies of their dismissals as part of a \u201creduction in force\u201d order. Housing and Urban Development, the General Services Administration, and USAID are among the agencies affected, with USAID set to cut 2,000 employees. This follows a wave of firings targeting probationary workers.Why It Matters: The mass layoffs are causing chaos within agencies, with unclear directives and legal challenges from labor unions. The regime\u2019s rushed approach is legally questionable and will severely impact government operations.Source: The New York TimesTrump Allies Push Plan for \u2018Processing Camps\u2019 and Private Deportation ForceWhat Happened: A group led by ex-Blackwater CEO Erik Prince proposed a $25 billion plan to deport 12 million people by 2026. The plan includes military-run \u201cprocessing camps,\u201d a fleet of 100 planes, and a private force empowered to make arrests.Why It Matters: This would privatize immigration enforcement, raising human rights concerns and the risk of a private army that Trump may use to later target Americans. Given Prince\u2019s extremist operations and Trump\u2019s past pardons of Blackwater contractors, it sets a dangerous precedent.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump\u2019s Capitol Riot Pardon Shields Vet from Weapons, Classified Docs CaseWhat Happened: The Justice Department determined that Trump\u2019s pardon of Army veteran Jeremy Brown for his role in the Capitol riot also clears him of separate charges for possessing stolen grenades, an unregistered rifle, and classified military documents. This is due to the broad interpretation of Trump\u2019s blanket pardon for Jan. 6 rioters and insurrectionists.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass pardons are shielding violent offenders and those with unrelated criminal convictions, sending a clear message that loyalty to him outweighs the rule of law. Source: Associated PressTrump\u2019s AG threatens 3 states over transgender sports policiesWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi warned California, Maine, and Minnesota officials to ban transgender athletes from women\u2019s sports or face legal action. The Education Department has also launched investigations that could lead to federal funding cuts for non-compliant schools.Why It Matters: This weaponizes the Justice Department to enforce Trump\u2019s attack on transgender rights, using federal funding as a coercive tool. It\u2019s a blatant effort to erase Title IX protections and strong-arm states into adopting discriminatory policies and Trump\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: PoliticoOutcry as DC US attorney claims he and colleagues are \u2018President Trump\u2019s lawyers\u2019What Happened: Interim US Attorney Ed Martin blatantly declared on X that he and his team are \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lawyers.\u201d This is a direct slap in the face to their constitutional oath to uphold the law\u2014not to serve any president.Why It Matters: Martin is acting as a political pawn and failing to serve the American people. Lawmakers called for Martin\u2019s resignation for betraying his duty.Source: GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News\ud83d\udea8White House Moves to Control Press Access, Picking Trump\u2019s Pool ReportersWhat Happened: Trump announced it will now handpick which media outlets can participate in the White House press pool, breaking decades of precedent where the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association selected journalists. The move allows the regime to control which reporters have direct access to the president\u2019s daily activities.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on press freedom, giving Trump control over media access and sidelining independent journalism. The WHCA and major news organizations have condemned the decision as an attempt to undermine accountability. The is an authoritarian tactic used to shape propaganda and limit transparency and is exactly what happens in Russia.Source: The New York TimesTrump\u2019s State Media: Propagandists Replace JournalistsWhat Happened: Trump has filled the White House press corps with far-right influencers while sidelining traditional media. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt openly targets legacy outlets, and the regime barred the AP from briefings for refusing to adopt Trump\u2019s preferred terminology.Why It Matters: Trump is manufacturing a pro-regime media bubble, ensuring only flattering coverage while blocking critical reporting\u2014an authoritarian tactic to control public discourse.Source: Mother JonesTrump Moves to Suspend Security Clearances of Lawyers Assisting Jack SmithWhat Happened: Trump ordered the suspension of security clearances for attorneys at Covington & Burling, the law firm representing special counsel Jack Smith, as retaliation for Smith\u2019s investigations into Trump. The firm, which had no role in prosecuting Trump\u2019s cases, is now under direct political attack after it provided Smith with legal representation.Why It Matters: This is a blatant abuse of power to punish legal professional. Targeting lawyers for defending a prosecutor undermines the rule of law and sends a chilling message: anyone who challenges Trump can expect government retaliation.Source: Associated PressMusk\u2019s Shadow Rule Over DOGE Sparks Legal ChaosWhat Happened: Despite the White House naming Amy Gleason as acting unauthorized FAKE DOGE administrator, Trump and Musk continue to assert Musk is running the agency. The Justice Department has taken contradictory positions in court, sometimes arguing that Musk is merely an advisor to shield him from legal challenges over his unchecked authority.Why It Matters: This deliberate obscurity is an authoritarian tactic\u2014shuffling titles and legal definitions to avoid accountability while unelected Musk wields enormous power over the federal government without Senate confirmation or oversight.Source: NBC NewsFAKE DOGE releases updated \"wall of receipts\" with more discrepanciesWhat Happened: FAKE DOGE\u2019s updated \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d doubled its listed contract cancellations, yet claimed savings dropped from $16.6B to $9.6B\u2014while its overall savings claim jumped to $65B without documentation. Errors, double-counting, and zero-savings contracts plague the report.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian style data manipulation\u2014fabricated figures to justify mass layoffs and agency purges. With no transparency or independent verification, Musk and Trump are gutting the government under false pretenses.Source: CBS News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Plans to Deport Unaccompanied Migrant ChildrenWhat Happened: Trump is planning a nationwide ICE operation to track down and potentially deport unaccompanied migrant children whose sponsors failed to answer check-in calls or who lack scheduled court dates. The move follows Trump\u2019s previous decision to cut legal aid services for migrant children, further limiting their ability to fight deportation.Why It Matters: This inhumane crackdown targets vulnerable children, many of whom fled violence and have no legal representation. By using ICE to target unaccompanied minors, Trump is weaponizing the immigration system against the most defenseless while dismantling safeguards meant to protect them.Source: NBC NewsTrump Proposes Fines, Prison Time for Undocumented Immigrants Who Don\u2019t RegisterWhat Happened: Trump has launched a mandatory registry for undocumented immigrants, requiring them to submit personal information\u2014including fingerprints and home addresses\u2014or face a $5,000 fine and up to six months in prison. Immigrants have 30 days to comply, with the Justice Department prioritizing prosecutions for non-compliance.Why It Matters: This registry criminalizes undocumented status, a drastic shift from previous immigration policies. It sets the stage for mass surveillance, deportations, and internment while overwhelming the justice system. Source: Wall Street JournalGOP Lawmakers Push to Undermine Same-Sex Marriage in 9 StatesWhat Happened: Legislators in at least nine states introduced measures attacking same-sex marriage, with five states \u2014MI, ID, MT, ND, SD\u2014 urging the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges. Meanwhile, MO, OK, TN, and TX proposed \u201ccovenant marriage\u201d laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman.Why It Matters: This is a direct attempt to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Despite national support for same-sex marriage, GOP lawmakers are escalating attacks to erode protections and legal recognition.Source: NBC NewsNJ Attorney General Warns of Special Education Crisis Amid Trump\u2019s DEI CrackdownWhat Happened: New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin is warning that Trump\u2019s directive to end DEI programs in schools would jeopardize critical federal funding for special education and low-income students. Schools risk losing Title I and IDEA funds if they fail to comply by March 1, but the vague wording of the order has left educators uncertain about what programs will be targeted.Why It Matters: Millions of vulnerable students\u2014including those with disabilities\u2014would lose essential services as Trump forces schools to dismantle diversity initiatives. Legal challenges are coming, but Platkin warns the immediate disruption to education will be devastating.Source: NOTUSSudan Faces Famine as Trump\u2019s USAID Freeze Takes TollWhat Happened: As Sudan's civil war rages, millions face starvation amid a collapsing economy. With USAID funds frozen under Trump\u2019s executive order, critical humanitarian aid has vanished. Why It Matters: This is a man-made disaster\u2014Trump\u2019s USAID halt is accelerating famine and depriving Sudan\u2019s war-torn population of essential food and medical aid. The consequences are catastrophic, with no clear plan for resuming assistance.Source: CBS NewsOhio University Enforces Trans Bathroom BanWhat Happened: The University of Cincinnati has begun displaying signs restricting restroom use based on \"biological sex,\" making it the first Ohio college to comply with a controversial new state law. The law, signed by Gov. Mike DeWine, mandates bathroom restrictions in both public and private schools and universities.Why It Matters: This further marginalizes transgender students and sets a precedent for other schools to follow. With vague enforcement measures, the law leaves room for discrimination, escalating the battle over LGBTQ+ rights in education.Source: NBC NewsUS threatens permanent visa bans on trans athletes based on sex markersWhat Happened: The State Department ordered global visa bans on transgender athletes, enforcing Trump\u2019s Feb. 5 executive order. Trans applicants deemed to have \u201cmisrepresented\u201d their birth sex face a permanent fraud bar, banning them from the U.S. for life.Why It Matters: This unprecedented expansion of immigration law targets trans people as a disfavored group, weaponizing visa policies to enforce Trump\u2019s anti-LGBTQ+ agenda.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch\ud83d\udea8DOGE to cancel government contracts that help veteransWhat Happened: Musk is canceling 875 contracts at The Department of Veterans Affairs, eliminating funding for medical services, cancer programs, doctor recruitment, and burial services for veterans. VA Secretary Douglas Collins claims the cuts, totaling nearly $2 billion, target \u201cwaste,\u201d but records show they affect critical veteran support programs.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are gutting critical programs at the expense of veterans\u2014who Republicans see as government \u201cwaste.\u201d The cuts eliminate oversight, environmental safety measures, and crucial healthcare services, that will harm veterans and their families.Source: The Washington PostFired VA Cybersecurity Chief Warns Veterans' Data at RiskWhat Happened:Jonathan Kamens, the former cybersecurity lead for VA.gov, warns that sensitive health and financial data for millions of veterans is now at risk after he and dozens of other U.S. Digital Service employees were abruptly fired as part of Elon Musk\u2019s purge. Kamens says his role is unlikely to be replaced, leaving a major security gap.Why It Matters: The reckless gutting of cybersecurity experts leaves veterans\u2019 personal data vulnerable to breaches, identity theft, and cyberattacks. With no replacement in sight, Musk and Trump\u2019s mass firings are actively endangering the security of critical government systems.Source: Associated PressUpheaval and firings at CDC raise fears about disease outbreak responseWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass firings at the CDC have left the agency short-staffed amid rising infectious disease threats, including measles outbreaks, bird flu, and Ebola abroad. Over 750 CDC employees have been terminated, including disease detection experts, outbreak modelers, and lab scientists responsible for developing critical diagnostic tests.Why It Matters: The cuts are crippling the America\u2019s ability to respond to emerging health crises, leaving gaps in vaccine policy, outbreak tracking, and lab testing. Infectious disease experts warn that Trump\u2019s politicization of public health will cost lives by delaying responses and creating chaos within the agency.Source: NPRFederal Employees Face More Demands to Justify Work at Musk\u2019s DirectionWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management hinted that federal employees could face ongoing demands to justify their work after Elon Musk\u2019s initial email directive. While OPM initially stated compliance was optional, a later memo suggested agencies should consider making such reports a regular requirement and sanction those who refuse. Trump reinforced the pressure, stating that non-compliance \u201ceventually\u201d leads to termination.Why It Matters: This regime is actively vilifying civil servants, creating a hostile work environment designed to push them out. By making federal jobs intolerable, Trump and Musk are gutting agencies through intimidation rather than legal terminations, forcing critical government functions into collapse.Source: Associated PressMass Federal Firings Hit Alaska, Hundreds Expected to Lose JobsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass firings of federal employees are having a major impact on Alaska\u2019s 15,000 federal workers, with over 1,378 probationary employees expected to be fired. The layoffs have affected multiple agencies, including the Air Force, DHS, Interior, and Agriculture.Why It Matters: The cuts will cripple Alaska\u2019s economy and disrupt critical services, including national parks, energy development, and tourism. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R) warns that the firings will do more harm than good and is urging Congress to push back. Unions are preparing a class-action lawsuit against the regime.Source: High North News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Aligns U.S. With Russia, North Korea, and Belarus at U.N.What Happened: The U.S., under Trump, voted against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, siding with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus. This starkly contrasted with traditional U.S. allies like Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Japan, who supported the measure.Why It Matters: Trump is openly shifting U.S. foreign policy, aligning with autocratic regimes and isolating Western allies. His deference to Moscow is unraveling decades-long alliances, weakening NATO unity, and emboldening Russia\u2019s geopolitical ambitions.

The contract, which could include 4,000 terminals over 12-18 months, follows Musk\\u2019s claim that the FAA\\u2019s existing Verizon system \\u201Cis not working\\u201D and endangers travelers.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s unelected position in the government while securing lucrative federal contracts for his companies highlights serious ethical concerns and corruption. Watchdogs warn of a \\u201Ccharade\\u201D where Musk, as a \\u201Cspecial government employee,\\u201D avoids financial disclosures while influencing policy in ways that directly benefit his businesses, including future space mining ventures.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/business/musk-faa-starlink-contract/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Unveils \\u2018Gold Card\\u2019 Visa for Wealthy Investors</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump proposed a new \\u201CGold Card\\u201D visa program granting residency and a path to citizenship for foreign investors\\u2014including Russian oligarchs he specifically mentioned\\u2014who pay $5 million. The initiative, set to launch in two weeks, replaces the EB-5 visa program and, according to Trump, does not require congressional approval.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>While Trump escalates his crackdown on undocumented migrants, he is openly selling U.S. residency to the ultra-rich. This blatant pay-to-play scheme prioritizes oligarchs and billionaires while shutting the door on those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/trump-to-launch-gold-card-visa-program-for-wealthy-investors?cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics&amp;embedded-checkout=true\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Staffers Keep Private Clients While Shaping Policy</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Key Trump officials, including Elon Musk and top aides, are operating as \\\\\\\"Special Government Employees,\\u201D allowing them to work for both the government and private clients. These SGEs, exempt from public financial disclosures, influence federal policy while maintaining ties to corporations, lobbying firms, and foreign-backed entities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The blurred lines between public service and private business create massive conflicts of interest and endanger national security. Musk, overseeing government restructuring while leading Tesla and SpaceX, and others with deep corporate ties highlight corruption and private enrichment at the expense of transparency.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-special-government-employees-75b2b6e5?mod=politics_lead_pos2\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s SEC Pick Built Career Defending Corporations From Regulators</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Paul Atkins, Trump\\u2019s nominee for SEC chairman, has a history of defending corporations against regulatory enforcement. As a consultant, he has worked for major Wall Street firms, including AT&amp;T and SAC Capital, often arguing that companies did not violate financial regulations. His role will lead to a rollback of SEC enforcement on issues like cryptocurrency and environmental disclosures.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Atkins\\u2019s deep ties to the financial sector raise serious conflict-of-interest concerns. His history of advocating for companies facing SEC scrutiny highlights Trump\\u2019s plans for deregulation and weaker corporate oversight, favoring Wall Street over investors and his billionaire cronies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/who-is-paul-atkins-trump-sec-chair-c68b0610?mod=hp_lista_pos5\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Ukraine Mineral Deal Seen as \\u2018Protection Racket\\u2019 Diplomacy</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is pressuring Ukraine to hand over a portion of its mineral revenues in exchange for continued U.S. support against Russia. The deal offers no explicit security guarantees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This transactional approach marks a radical departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy, and is an extortion scheme rather than an alliance.

Internal records show Musk operatives actively editing the software, with ex-Tesla engineer Riccardo Biasini leading the effort.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump and Musk are fast-tracking an AI-powered purge, gutting the federal workforce with mass firings that bypass due process, turning civil service into a political loyalty test.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Puts Don Jr.\\u2019s Hunting Buddy in Charge of U.S. Food Safety</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump appointed Kyle Diamantas, a Florida attorney and Don Jr.\\u2019s hunting pal, as acting deputy commissioner for human foods at the FDA, overseeing 80% of the U.S. food supply without Senate confirmation. His appointment follows mass firings at the FDA and the resignation of its food safety chief.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump prioritizes loyalty over expertise, which will endanger food safety, especially as the U.S. grapples with bird flu and a deadly Listeria outbreak.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/kyle-diamantas-fda\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Large-Scale Federal Workforce Cuts Enter Next Phase</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s regime has begun notifying employees across multiple agencies of their dismissals as part of a \\u201Creduction in force\\u201D order. Housing and Urban Development, the General Services Administration, and USAID are among the agencies affected, with USAID set to cut 2,000 employees. This follows a wave of firings targeting probationary workers.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The mass layoffs are causing chaos within agencies, with unclear directives and legal challenges from labor unions.

The plan includes military-run \\u201Cprocessing camps,\\u201D a fleet of 100 planes, and a private force empowered to make arrests.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would privatize immigration enforcement, raising human rights concerns and the risk of a private army that Trump may use to later target Americans.

This is due to the broad interpretation of Trump\\u2019s blanket pardon for Jan. 6 rioters and insurrectionists.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s mass pardons are shielding violent offenders and those with unrelated criminal convictions, sending a clear message that loyalty to him outweighs the rule of law. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardons-capitol-riot-jeremy-brown-4a06a284fd2f8a2bd723b1a26970a2e7\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s AG threatens 3 states over transgender sports policies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Attorney General Pam Bondi warned California, Maine, and Minnesota officials to ban transgender athletes from women\\u2019s sports or face legal action.
