Eric Thayer/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: June 9Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session #2Google Meet: June 10, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ize2tO9wo7BCGqa0AGeK82sK_6DFVny5TRM4SQiRAD8/editDon\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsUS team investigating foreign bribery dwindles, sources sayWhat Happened: The Justice Department\u2019s team enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been slashed from 32 to just 15 prosecutors after Trump ordered a pause on the decades-old anti-bribery law. The move triggered staff departures and a shift in focus away from foreign corruption toward cases involving drug cartels.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling key anti-corruption tools, protecting corporate and foreign allies while deprioritizing white-collar crime. Weakening FCPA enforcement allows open season for bribery and global corruption.Source: ReutersA Trump Family Project Spurs Resignations and a Criminal Charge in SerbiaWhat Happened: A Trump-branded hotel project in Belgrade\u2014backed by Jared Kushner and involving Eric and Donald Trump Jr.\u2014triggered a political firestorm after Serbian officials stripped cultural protections from a bombed-out military building to pave the way for development. The move led to mass protests, resignations, and a criminal charge against the director of Serbia\u2019s cultural preservation institute for falsifying documents. Intelligence agents reportedly pressured dissenters to back off.Why It Matters: This is textbook corruption\u2014foreign government favors, backroom deals, threats to whistleblowers, and a criminal cover-up, all to enrich the Trump family. Source: New York TimesNorth Dakota Ethics Commission Has No Authority to Punish Officials Violating Ethics Laws, State Leaders ArgueWhat Happened: State leaders in North Dakota claim the Ethics Commission\u2014created by voters in 2018\u2014has no legal power to punish officials, despite a record number of complaints. Lawmakers rejected bills to strengthen the agency, slashed its budget, and passed laws shielding themselves from accountability.Why It Matters: Officials are neutering a watchdog voters demanded\u2014gutting oversight, denying enforcement power, and protecting themselves from consequences. It\u2019s a clear move to shield corruption and dismantle democratic accountability.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsFor Trump, seizing emergency powers has become central to governingWhat Happened: Trump has declared at least 8 national emergencies since returning to office, using them to bypass laws, override opposition, and justify extreme actions, including sending the National Guard to Los Angeles against the state\u2019s wishes. Many of the \u201cemergencies\u201d are manufactured to consolidate power and incite fear.Why It Matters: Trump is abusing emergency declarations to rule unilaterally, sidestep Congress, and militarize domestic policy. This pattern mirrors authoritarian governance, where fabricated crises are used to justify expansion of power, crackdowns, silence dissent, and erode democracy.Source: Washington Post and NPRPentagon Races to Set Rules for Marines Deployed to LAWhat Happened: The Pentagon is drafting use-of-force rules for 700 Marines sent to Los Angeles protests, following Trump\u2019s order to deploy troops alongside ICE and National Guard. Marines are authorized to use force in self-defense and temporarily detain civilians.Why It Matters: This marks a dangerous shift toward using active-duty troops for domestic law enforcement, without invoking the Insurrection Act. The tactics mirror those used by regimes like Russia.Source: Associated PressLocal Police Join ICE Deportation Force in Record Numbers Despite Warnings Program Lacks OversightWhat Happened: ICE is deputizing local cops in record numbers under Trump\u2019s revived 287(g) Program, letting them act as immigration agents. Over 500 new agreements have been signed since January, even in states like Tennessee and Florida, despite past scandals of racial profiling and abuse.Why It Matters: Trump is turning local cops into deportation squads\u2014no training, no rules\u2014tearing families apart and fueling racial profiling. It\u2019s how a police state takes root: unchecked federal power, enforced through local forces, and it won\u2019t stop with immigrants. This system will expand to target all Americans who dissent.Source: ProPublicaTrump Limits Cyber Rules Targeting U.S. Election MeddlersWhat Happened: Trump issued an executive order blocking the use of cyber sanctions against Americans and U.S. firms, limiting them to foreign actors. The order guts Obama and Biden-era rules that punished election interference and cyberattacks.Why It Matters: This removes key protections against domestic election meddling and cyber threats\u2014shielding U.S.-based actors who engage in attacks or disinformation. It\u2019s a dangerous rollback that makes America more vulnerable to internal attacks by Trump\u2019s allies.Source: Defense One\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsFTC Targets Top Ad Agencies in Elon Musk Boycott ProbeWhat Happened: The Federal Trade Commission has demanded records from major ad firms, including Omnicom, WPP, Dentsu, Publicis, and Interpublic, as part of an antitrust probe into alleged \u201ccollusion\u201d to boycott Musk\u2019s platform X. The investigation also includes watchdog groups like Media Matters and Ad Fontes Media.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s FTC is weaponizing antitrust laws to protect Musk, his top donor, and punish media accountability groups. This politicized probe is meant to chill corporate free speech and further dismantle democratic oversight of disinformation platforms.Source: Wall Street JournalUnder Patel, FBI heightens focus on violent crime, illegal immigration. Other threats abound, tooWhat Happened: Kash Patel has reoriented the bureau to focus on violent crime, drug trafficking, and immigration, sidelining counterintelligence and corruption. Units investigating foreign influence and public corruption have been disbanded, and agents reassigned to cartel and Hamas-related cases.Why It Matters: The FBI has become a politicized enforcement arm of Trump\u2019s agenda, ignoring major national security threats from Russia and China while criminalizing immigration and ignoring domestic extremism.Source: Associated PressMasked ICE Agents Spark Outrage Amid LA RaidsWhat Happened: ICE agents wearing masks and balaclavas during mass immigration raids in Los Angeles and across the country have ignited backlash from lawmakers and civil rights groups. The tactic is meant to intimidate and avoid accountability. Why It Matters: Masked, unidentifiable agents on U.S. streets look less like law enforcement and more like secret police. It\u2019s a dangerous break from democratic norms\u2014and a tactic straight out of the authoritarian playbook.Source: ReutersDemocrats Accuse Gabbard of Illegal Meddling in Intelligence OversightWhat Happened: Top Democrats say Tulsi Gabbard violated federal law by interfering with the Intelligence Community Inspector General\u2019s office, firing key legal staff, and inserting a Trump loyalist who reports directly to her. They warn the move compromises the watchdog\u2019s independence.Why It Matters: The inspector general\u2019s office is one of the last internal checks on Trump\u2019s politicized intelligence machine. Gutting it removes critical oversight just as Trump purges dissent and weaponizes national security. This is part of a broader crackdown to silence watchdogs and consolidate control.Source: Washington PostDemocratic lawmakers denied entry to detention centers in LA and New YorkWhat Happened: Multiple Democratic members of Congress were denied entry to federal detention centers in Los Angeles and New York. They attempted visits to inspect conditions following mass immigration raids and arrests of protesters. Some lawmakers said they were met with chemical irritants and locked gates, accusing DHS of obstructing oversight.Why It Matters: Blocking elected officials from accessing detention facilities is a direct attack on the balance of power. It marks a troubling escalation in Trump\u2019s crackdown\u2014shutting out accountability while human rights abuses grow in the shadows.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump mobilizes Marines and more National Guard troops for duty in LAWhat Happened: Trump deployed 700 Marines and 2,000 more National Guard troops, bringing the total to 4,000, to L.A. without state approval, prompting a lawsuit from Governor Newsom. He labeled protesters \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d and warned the city would be \u201cobliterated\u201d without federal force.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous abuse of power\u2014preparing to use military force against civilians while defying state authority and sovereignty. The regime is priming the public with language like \u201cinsurrection\u201d to justify crackdowns and normalize domestic military deployment.Source: NPR'I would': Trump says he'd arrest California Gov. Gavin NewsomWhat Happened: Trump said he \u201cwould\u201d arrest California Gov. Gavin Newsom, calling it a \u201cgreat thing.\u201d The threat followed Newsom\u2019s public defiance of Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles to suppress protests against immigration raids. Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, also hinted at arresting local officials who interfere with federal enforcement.Why It Matters: Threatening to arrest a sitting governor is authoritarian thuggery. Trump is weaponizing federal power to crush opponents and break democratic norms. Newsom warns this is a constitutional crisis.Source: USA TodayJournalists Caught in Crossfire as Trump\u2019s Crackdown EscalatesWhat Happened: Police in Los Angeles shot Australian journalist Lauren Tomasi with a rubber bullet live on air, tear-gassed another, and seriously injured British photojournalist Nick Stern. LAPD also detained CNN\u2019s Jason Carroll live on air and arrested two of his camera operators, despite clear press credentials.Why It Matters: Journalists are being targeted, just like in authoritarian regimes. Attacking both foreign and U.S. press on American soil is a global disgrace.Source: The GuardianLAPD Detains CNN Reporter Live On Air, Arrests Two Camera OperatorsWhat Happened: CNN correspondent Jason Carroll was briefly detained live on air by LAPD officers while covering immigration protests in Los Angeles, despite clearly identifying as press. Officers threatened him with arrest if he returned. CNN confirmed two of its camera operators were arrested.Why It Matters: Detaining and arresting journalists mid-broadcast violates press freedom and California law. It\u2019s increasingly dangerous to operate as a journalist in the U.S., and the media must stand together.Source: TheWrapAmid Trump standoff, Smithsonian says only secretary can hire and fireWhat Happened: The Smithsonian Board of Regents reaffirmed that only Secretary Lonnie Bunch can make personnel decisions, after Trump claimed to have fired National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet for alleged partisanship. Sajet continues reporting to work, defying Trump\u2019s announcement.Why It Matters: The board\u2019s stance is a rare institutional rebuke of Trump\u2019s overreach, defending the Smithsonian\u2019s independence from political interference. As Trump purges other cultural agencies, this fight signals a broader battle to shield U.S. arts and history from authoritarian control.Source: Washington PostAn LAPD Helicopter Claimed Cops Identified Protesters From Above and Would \u201cCome to Your House\u201dWhat Happened: During anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, an LAPD helicopter announced over the loudspeaker, \u201cI have all of you on camera. I\u2019m going to come to your house,\u201d raising fears of facial recognition and targeted retribution. Civil liberties groups say this is an attempt to intimidate people from exercising their First Amendment rights.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian policing\u2014using state surveillance to threaten dissenters and suppress protest. Whether real or performative, it sends a chilling message that dissent may get you tracked and punished.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsCalifornia union leader\u2019s arrest at immigration protest sparks outcryWhat Happened: SEIU California president David Huerta was arrested during an immigration protest and charged with conspiracy to \u201cimpede\u201d federal agents. His arrest is part of a wave of felony prosecutions targeting Trump critics, including judges and members of Congress who have opposed immigration sweeps.Why It Matters: The Justice Department is weaponizing the law to criminalize dissent, targeting political opponents, labor leaders, and protesters. The arrest of Dolores Huerta, coupled with threats to jail Gov. Gavin Newsom, reiterates a dangerous shift where protest becomes a crime and opposition a target.Source: Washington Post\u2018Kidnapped\u2019: Families and Lawyers Desperate for Info on LA ICE Raid VictimsWhat Happened: After sweeping ICE raids in LA, families say their loved ones, many longtime workers with no criminal records, have vanished without communication or legal access. Federal officials confirmed at least 118 arrests and admitted some detainees have no prior offenses. Legal groups say people were held in basements without food or water, and at least one was deported without paperwork.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass raids, detentions, and deportations\u2014carried out without transparency or due process\u2014are sowing fear and chaos in immigrant communities. The tactics resemble disappearances in Russia, where families struggle to get basic information. Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s travel ban could cement racism as his most dangerous legacyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s latest travel ban targets predominantly Black and Muslim-majority nations, reviving tactics from his 2017 \u201cMuslim ban\u201d with little public outcry. Critics argue the move is rooted in white nationalist ideology, further normalizing racism in U.S. immigration policy.Why It Matters: The expanded ban is part of a broader pattern \u2014 from DEI rollbacks to refugee disparities \u2014 that cements racism as a core element of Trumpism. Experts warn this normalization of hate-fueled policy may be Trump\u2019s most enduring and dangerous legacy.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Aide Upended Pentagon Leak Probe With Fake Wiretap ClaimWhat Happened: Justin Fulcher, a former Musk staffer close to Pete Hegseth, falsely claimed to have NSA surveillance proof identifying leakers of a classified Pentagon document about military plans for Panama. His bogus intel led to the firing of three top aides\u2014claims that were relayed to the White House as fact before being debunked.Why It Matters: This bizarre episode highlights the chaos and insanity inside the Pentagon, where unverified conspiracies and internal power plays now shape national security decisions. It raises urgent concerns about the growing weaponization of fake intelligence to justify purges of perceived disloyalty, placing ideology above military discipline and truth.Source: The GuardianKennedy Removes All C.D.C. Vaccine Panel ExpertsWhat Happened: RFK Jr. fired all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which sets national vaccine guidelines. Kennedy, a vocal vaccine skeptic, claimed the purge was needed to \u201crestore trust\u201d and eliminate \u201cconflicts of interest.\u201d Public health experts warned that the move guts science-based policymaking.Why It Matters: This is an assault on medical science. Replacing leading vaccine experts with political loyalists and extremists threatens national immunization efforts, undermines public trust, and risks millions losing access to critical, life-saving vaccines.Source: New York TimesN.I.H. Workers Denounce Trump\u2019s \u2018Harmful\u2019 Health PoliciesWhat Happened: Over 60 employees at the National Institutes of Health signed a public letter\u2014The Bethesda Declaration\u2014condemning Trump\u2019s health policies as unethical, politically driven, and dangerous. They accuse him of censoring science, cutting $18 billion from the NIH budget, halting over 1,300 grants, and endangering patients in ongoing clinical trials. Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling the U.S.\u2019s premier medical research agency from within. By slashing budgets, politicizing science, and censoring research, the regime is turning public health into a partisan battlefield\u2014at the cost of lives, innovation, and global credibility.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Loan Caps Could Deepen U.S. Doctor Shortage, Critics WarnWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill includes a cap of $150,000 on federal loans for graduate students, well below the cost of medical school, and eliminates the Grad PLUS loan program. Medical and osteopathic schools warn this will deter students from low- and middle-income backgrounds, worsen the looming doctor shortage, and limit access to care in rural and underserved communities.Why It Matters: At a time when the U.S. faces a shortage of nearly 200,000 physicians by 2037, Trump\u2019s plan makes medical school affordable only for the wealthy. Critics say it guts health equity, undercuts public service, and puts patient care\u2014and the future medical workforce\u2014at risk.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIran Rejects U.S. Proposal to End Uranium Enrichment, Trump ConfirmsWhat Happened: Trump announced that Iran has rejected a key element of a U.S. proposal to halt uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. Trump declared any enrichment \u201cunacceptable\u201d and confirmed ongoing talks would continue, though he warned the current path is \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d The proposal aimed to replace Iran\u2019s domestic enrichment with an international fuel consortium.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Launches Biggest Drone Assault of the War, Ukraine SaysWhat Happened: Russia launched 479 drones and 20 missiles at Ukraine in the largest aerial assault of the war, according to Ukrainian officials. While most were intercepted, strikes were recorded in Rivne, Kyiv, and Sumy. A maternity hospital in Odesa was also bombed, and one person was killed.Why It Matters: As Trump pushes Ukraine toward surrender, Russia escalates with overwhelming aerial attacks and brutal civilian targeting. The scale and frequency of these assaults reiterate Moscow\u2019s intent to continue its genocidal war.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsGOP bill could worsen inflation and lead to financial crisis, economists warnWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax-and-tariff bill, now in the Senate, is facing backlash from economists, investors, and even Musk. Critics argue that the $3 trillion plan will drive up inflation and interest rates, while exacerbating the national debt. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has warned that it puts the U.S. \u201con the foothills of stagflation.\u201dWhy It Matters: The bill\u2019s passage will destabilize the economy, combining massive borrowing with trade barriers that raise consumer prices. Economists warn that the policy mix resembles conditions that triggered 1970s-style stagflation and could spark a financial crisis if enacted.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/14- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501States Sue to Stop Return of Seized Machine Gun Conversion DevicesWhat Happened: A coalition of 15 Democratic-led states and D.C. sued Trump after it agreed to return thousands of seized \u201cforced-reset triggers\u201d\u2014devices that convert semi-automatic rifles into near-machine guns. The devices, previously banned under Biden, are now being returned even to residents of states where they're illegal, including convicted felons.Source: New York TimesTrump's Budget Bill Sparks Backlash at GOP Town HallsWhat Happened: At a heated town hall in Mahopac, NY, Rep. Mike Lawler faced boos and pointed questions over Trump\u2019s sweeping tax and spending bill, which slashes Medicaid, expands tax cuts for the wealthy, and returns machine gun conversion devices. Lawler defended the bill\u2019s work requirements for Medicaid recipients but struggled to calm the crowd. Source: ReutersCalifornia suing Trump over deployment of National Guard in Los AngelesWhat Happened: California has filed a lawsuit against Trump over his unilateral deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid protests against ICE raids. Governor Gavin Newsom argues the deployment, ordered without state request or consent, violates constitutional limits on federal military power and state sovereignty.Source: ReutersLatinas for Trump Co-Founder Slams Immigration Arrests: \u201cUnacceptable and Inhumane\u201dWhat Happened: Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia, a co-founder of Latinas for Trump, condemned Trump\u2019s immigration arrests as \u201carbitrary,\u201d \u201cinhumane,\u201d and a betrayal of what supporters voted for.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Public Health in Collapse \u2014 RFK Jr.\u2019s purge of the CDC\u2019s vaccine panel and Trump\u2019s $18 billion cut to NIH funding have gutted science-based health policy. Over 1,300 research grants have been halted, and access to lifesaving vaccines is at risk.Militarized Immigration Crackdown \u2014 From masked ICE agents and secret detentions to Marines deployed in Los Angeles, the regime is turning immigration enforcement into a tool of fear and control, with tactics pulled straight from authoritarian playbooks and set to expand.Corruption is Open Season \u2014 With FCPA enforcement gutted, the DOJ is deprioritizing foreign bribery cases. Meanwhile, Trump family deals abroad, like the scandal-plagued Belgrade hotel, are sparking criminal charges and cover-ups.Press Freedom Under Assault \u2014 Journalists are being shot, arrested, and threatened on live TV.

Critics say it guts health equity, undercuts public service, and puts patient care\u2014and the future medical workforce\u2014at risk.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em><span> </span><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/health/trump-budget-student-loans-doctors.html\" rel=\"\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7imperial-and-geopolitical-watch\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/165597875/imperial-and-geopolitical-watch\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p></p><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Iran Rejects U.S. Proposal to End Uranium Enrichment, Trump Confirms<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7iran-rejects-us-proposal-to-end-uranium-enrichment-trump-confirms\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/165597875/iran-rejects-us-proposal-to-end-uranium-enrichment-trump-confirms\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump announced that Iran has rejected a key element of a U.S. proposal to halt uranium enrichment on Iranian soil.

The move triggered staff departures and a shift in focus away from foreign corruption toward cases involving drug cartels.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is dismantling key anti-corruption tools, protecting corporate and foreign allies while deprioritizing white-collar crime.

Lawmakers rejected bills to strengthen the agency, slashed its budget, and passed laws shielding themselves from accountability.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Officials are neutering a watchdog voters demanded\\u2014gutting oversight, denying enforcement power, and protecting themselves from consequences.

Many of the \\u201Cemergencies\\u201D are manufactured to consolidate power and incite fear.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is abusing emergency declarations to rule unilaterally, sidestep Congress, and militarize domestic policy.

Marines are authorized to use force in self-defense and temporarily detain civilians.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks a dangerous shift toward using active-duty troops for domestic law enforcement, without invoking the Insurrection Act.

Over 500 new agreements have been signed since January, even in states like Tennessee and Florida, despite past scandals of racial profiling and abuse.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is turning local cops into deportation squads\\u2014no training, no rules\\u2014tearing families apart and fueling racial profiling.

The order guts Obama and Biden-era rules that punished election interference and cyberattacks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This removes key protections against domestic election meddling and cyber threats\\u2014shielding U.S.-based actors who engage in attacks or disinformation.

The investigation also includes watchdog groups like Media Matters and Ad Fontes Media.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s FTC is weaponizing antitrust laws to protect Musk, his top donor, and punish media accountability groups.

Units investigating foreign influence and public corruption have been disbanded, and agents reassigned to cartel and Hamas-related cases.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The FBI has become a politicized enforcement arm of Trump\\u2019s agenda, ignoring major national security threats from Russia and China while criminalizing immigration and ignoring domestic extremism.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/fbi-patel-shifting-priorities-violent-crime-c0924b31e1d1a8ca4c2e3b53184bafa2\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Masked ICE Agents Spark Outrage Amid LA Raids</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE agents wearing masks and balaclavas during mass immigration raids in Los Angeles and across the country have ignited backlash from lawmakers and civil rights groups. The tactic is meant to intimidate and avoid accountability. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Masked, unidentifiable agents on U.S. streets look less like law enforcement and more like secret police.

They warn the move compromises the watchdog\\u2019s independence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The inspector general\\u2019s office is one of the last internal checks on Trump\\u2019s politicized intelligence machine.

They attempted visits to inspect conditions following mass immigration raids and arrests of protesters. Some lawmakers said they were met with chemical irritants and locked gates, accusing DHS of obstructing oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Blocking elected officials from accessing detention facilities is a direct attack on the balance of power.
