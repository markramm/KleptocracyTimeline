This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ize2tO9wo7BCGqa0AGeK82sK_6DFVny5TRM4SQiRAD8/editDon\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsWho\u2019s the Businessman Who Set Up the New Private Trump Club in DC?What Happened: A new private club called The Executive Branch opened in D.C., charging up to $500,000 for access to Trump insiders. It\u2019s backed by David Sacks, the Winklevoss twins, Donald Trump Jr., and is legally run by Sacks\u2019s longtime business partner, Glenn Gilmore.Why It Matters: More blatant pay-to-play corruption. The Trump family and allies are selling elite access and using government positions to enrich themselves. The swamp is now a private club with a $500,000 price tag.Source: Mother JonesTrump touts $5 million \"Trump card\" on social media, says waitlist is openWhat Happened: Trump launched a waitlist for the \u201cTrump Card,\u201d a $5 million residency scheme for the global elite. Promoted via Trumpcard.gov, it promises green card-style residency with Trump\u2019s face on it and no Congressional approval required.Why It Matters: Trump is selling U.S. residency like a luxury product. It\u2019s a pay-to-play scheme that rewards the ultra-rich, sidelines democratic checks, endangers national security, and turns immigration policy into personal branding and profit.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump's Deployment of Troops to LA Prompts Legal Showdown With CaliforniaWhat Happened: Trump deployed Marines and National Guard troops to assist ICE in Los Angeles using a little-known law\u2014Section 12406 of Title 10\u2014sidestepping both the Insurrection Act and state consent. Governor Gavin Newsom is suing to block the move, calling it unconstitutional. Legal experts warn it dangerously skirts the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement.Why It Matters: Trump continues testing the legal limits of military power on U.S. soil. If allowed to stand, this sets a chilling precedent, eroding the line between civilian protest and military force, and opening the door to control through armed federal intervention\u2014as seen in Russia and other authoritarian countries.Source: ABC NewsTrump Calls Fed Chair \u2018Numbskull,\u2019 Threatens to \u2018Force Something\u2019 on Interest RatesWhat Happened: At a bill signing event, Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and accusing him of stalling rate cuts. Trump claimed the U.S. could save hundreds of billions if Powell acted and hinted he might \u201cforce something\u201d on the Fed, though he didn\u2019t clarify what that meant.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s repeated threats signal a dangerous move to erode the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence, long seen as a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. Undermining it would rattle global markets and mirror authoritarian regimes, where political leaders control monetary policy for personal or political gain.Source: The HillTrump\u2019s Use of National Guard in Limbo After Court RulingsWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled Trump illegally seized control of California\u2019s National Guard, ordering troops returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom. However, active-duty Marines deployed nearby remain under federal control for now. The Ninth Circuit temporarily blocked the ruling from taking effect pending appeal.Why It Matters: The judge called it a dangerous overreach that threatens democracy and public safety. The fight is likely headed to the Supreme Court.Source: New York Times\u2018We\u2019re gonna have troops everywhere\u2019: Trump\u2019s use of the military to quell protests is a shocking abuse of powerWhat Happened: Trump has federalized 4,000 National Guard troops and deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to suppress protests over immigration raids\u2014the largest domestic military deployment in over half a century. He\u2019s also hinting at broader crackdowns nationwide.Why It Matters: Trump is militarizing dissent, testing authoritarian tools, and exploiting patriotic imagery to justify political control. It sets the stage for invoking the Insurrection Act and turning the U.S. into a police state.Source: The Independent\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsSen. Alex Padilla Handcuffed and Forcibly Removed from Noem\u2019s Press ConferenceWhat Happened: California Sen. Alex Padilla was violently restrained and handcuffed by Secret Service and FBI agents after attempting to question Kristi Noem at a press event in Los Angeles. Video shows Padilla identifying himself as a U.S. Senator and shouting \u201chands off!\u201d as he was pinned to the ground and handcuffed. DHS lied that he failed to identify himself and posed a \u201cthreat.\u201dWhy It Matters: A sitting U.S. senator was manhandled and silenced for demanding accountability, while Congresswoman McIver was recently indicted, a mayor arrested, and judges hauled away. This is how authoritarian regimes operate. If they can do this to a Senator, no one is safe.Source: The GuardianTrump Deploys IRS to Hunt Protest Funders in Los AngelesWhat Happened: Trump and Kristi Noem have ordered the IRS to assist in Los Angeles by identifying \u201cfinancial backers\u201d of protests. The move is being framed as a crackdown on \u201coutside agitators,\u201d possibly by \u201cforeign adversaries.\u201d Trump baselessly claimed California officials paid protesters, then later walked back the statement.Why It Matters: More abuse of power and weaponizing of agencies\u2014using the IRS to hunt political enemies and intimidate dissenters. It weaponizes financial surveillance against protest movements and mirrors tactics used by authoritarian regimes to crush opposition. These actions mimic Russia\u2019s tactics.Source: NPRDOJ Orders Prosecutors to Publicize Charges Against Trump Immigration ProtestersWhat Happened: The Justice Department reportedly prepared guidance for all 93 U.S. attorney offices and its criminal division to be on standby this weekend, ready to swiftly file federal charges against protesters. The draft directive outlines over a dozen potential charges, including statutes previously used against January 6 insurrectionists, and encourages publicizing arrests with press releases. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signaled \u201czero tolerance\u201d for protest-related offenses.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DOJ continues laying the groundwork to equate peaceful protest with \u201cinsurrection\u201d and \u201crebellion,\u201d using legal threats to intimidate dissent. This threatens First Amendment rights and reiterates a growing embrace of authoritarian tactics and the ongoing weaponization of federal agencies.Source: New York Times and ReutersU.S. Immigration Agency Using Drones Capable of Surveillance During L.A. ProtestsWhat Happened: DHS confirmed it is flying Predator drones over Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement during protests against Trump\u2019s immigration raids. The drones are capturing aerial footage\u2014some of which DHS has posted online with inflammatory captions. Officials insist it\u2019s for \u201csituational awareness,\u201d but this amounts to militarized surveillance of civilians.Why It Matters: Trump is normalizing the use of wartime surveillance tech against Americans. Deploying military-grade drones to monitor protests pushes the U.S. toward authoritarian territory.Source: TIMEHegseth Won\u2019t Commit to Following Court Order on LA Troop DeploymentWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth refused to say whether he would comply with a federal court order if it rules that Trump\u2019s deployment of troops to Los Angeles is illegal. Pressed by lawmakers, Hegseth dodged questions and dismissed district court authority over \u201cnational security decisions.\u201d Why It Matters: When the Defense Secretary won\u2019t commit to obeying court orders, it signals a dangerous erosion of civilian oversight and the rule of law. Defying the judiciary is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes\u2014and under Trump, it\u2019s policy.Source: Military.com House Republicans vote to claw back $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid, NPR and PBSWhat Happened: House Republicans passed a $9.4 billion rescissions package targeting public broadcasting and foreign aid. The cuts slash $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $1 billion from global health, HIV, and refugee programs.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting public media and humanitarian aid to weaken institutions that inform, support, and connect communities at home and abroad. It's also an attack on independent journalism\u2014silencing nonpartisan sources of information.Source: NBC NewsHouse Votes to Nullify D.C.\u2019s Sanctuary City Law, Forcing Cooperation with ICEWhat Happened: The House passed a bill overriding D.C.\u2019s \u201csanctuary city\u201d policy, which would force local officials to comply with federal immigration enforcement, including ICE detainer requests. 11 Democrats joined Republicans in the vote, the third GOP override of D.C. policy this week.Why It Matters: Trump is using Congress to punish sanctuary cities and force federal control over local law enforcement. It erodes D.C. self-governance and targets immigrant communities, making public safety a casualty of political retribution.Source: The Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsHow MAGA Took Over America\u2019s 250th BirthdayWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s America250 military parade\u2014marking the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th and Trump\u2019s birthday\u2014is being organized by January 6 figures, MAGA operatives, and crypto financiers. Sponsors include Palantir, Coinbase, UFC, and Tron, whose founder, Justin Sun, is a major Trump donor and recently had an SEC investigation dropped. What was once a bipartisan celebration is now a Trump spectacle, complete with tanks and campaign branding.Why It Matters: Trump hijacked a national celebration to glorify himself and project authoritarian power. With Jan. 6 insiders at the helm and crypto elites funding the show, Trump is using the military, symbols of national unity, and patriotic events to stage a propaganda spectacle. Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDHS Ends Parole for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Migrants; Urges Self-DeportationWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security has terminated the CHNV parole program, revoking legal status and work permits for over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Migrants are being urged to self-deport via an app and are being offered $1,000 if they comply.Why It Matters: Terminating a key humanitarian program risks mass destabilization, family separation, and deportation to unsafe countries\u2014while normalizing a digital infrastructure designed to expedite deportations and erode due process.Source: CBS News\u2018Snatching Off the Streets\u2019: ICE Raids Churches, Workplaces, and Homes What Happened: In the latest escalation of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, ICE agents have conducted aggressive raids across California, arresting people at churches, car washes, parking lots, playgrounds, homes, and near schools. Why It Matters: ICE is rounding people up without warrants, backed by the military, and ignoring basic rights and due process. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is spreading fear, separating families, and terrorizing communities.Source: The GuardianRaids in Southern California rattle immigrant communities \u2014 including those in the US legallyWhat Happened: ICE raids in Los Angeles swept up over 100 immigrant workers, many with no criminal records, during aggressive operations at garment warehouses and Home Depot lots. Families report being left in the dark about their loved ones\u2019 whereabouts. Even legal residents fear being targeted.Why It Matters: These raids aren\u2019t about deporting violent criminals\u2014they\u2019re about spreading fear. Trump is using mass arrests, military deployments, and disregard for basic rights to terrorize immigrant communities and create chaos.Source: Associated PressFlorida Sheriff Threatens Protesters: \u201cWe Will Kill You, Graveyard Dead\u201dWhat Happened: Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey issued a violent warning ahead of national \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests, saying deputies would kill anyone who attacks them. In a press conference, Ivey stated, \u201cWe will kill you, graveyard dead,\u201d if protesters throw bricks or firebombs and threatened severe physical retaliation for even spitting on law enforcement.Why It Matters: The sheriff\u2019s insane threats normalize the use of violent rhetoric and mark a dangerous turn toward authoritarian policing. When officials threaten protesters with lethal force, it erodes the rule of law and trust. We have courts, not firing squads, for a reason.Source: KATV News\u201cDelay, Interfere, Undermine\u201dWhat Happened: Despite praising El Salvador\u2019s crackdown on MS-13, President Bukele secretly blocked extraditions of key gang leaders wanted by the U.S.\u2014leaders who were reportedly tied to a federal investigation into diverted USAID funds. Prosecutors suspected Bukele\u2019s allies cut deals with MS-13 for political gain. Now aligned with Bukele on mass deportations, Trump has deprioritized the case, and two MS-13 indictments are being dismissed.Why It Matters: Trump is protecting an authoritarian ally by derailing a major terrorism and corruption case. This undermines U.S. prosecutors, shields foreign criminals, and signals to the world that autocrats can cut deals with Trump if they play to Trump\u2019s agenda.Source: ProPublicaInside a Courthouse, Chaos and Tears as Trump Accelerates DeportationsWhat Happened: ICE agents are now conducting arrests inside New York City immigration courts, ambushing immigrants during routine check-ins and hearings. At 26 Federal Plaza, fear is spreading: missed appearances, overcrowded holding cells, and abrupt family separations have turned the courthouse into a flashpoint of chaos.Why It Matters: Trump has turned legal compliance into a trap. By targeting people who show up to court, his regime is eroding trust in the justice system, bypassing due process, and weaponizing fear to accelerate deportations and silence vulnerable communities.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchGOP Megabill Boosts Wealthy Households While Hurting Poor, CBO SaysWhat Happened: A new Congressional Budget Office analysis shows that Republicans\u2019 tax-and-spending bill would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, granting the top 10% an average gain of $12,000, while slashing Medicaid and food aid for the poorest Americans, who would lose about $1,600 on average. Middle-income families see only modest relief.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s economic plan doubles down on inequality, extending tax breaks for the rich while gutting support for those most in need. The poorest Americans are being sacrificed for tax cuts for the wealthy.Source: Wall Street Journal and New York TimesTrump to end DHS program designed to thwart terrorist attacksWhat Happened: Trump is eliminating the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s $18 million terrorism prevention grant program, which experts say has helped thwart mass casualty attacks by identifying radicalized individuals early. The program supported local efforts like school-based threat assessments and mental health interventions.Why It Matters: This will leave the U.S. more vulnerable to domestic terrorism, especially lone-wolf violence, which has surged in recent years. The move reflects a shift away from prevention, despite growing threats and recent deadly attacks in Boulder, D.C., New Orleans, and New York.Source: NBC NewsTrump Orders Wildland Firefighter Merger Despite Warnings of ChaosWhat Happened: Trump ordered the consolidation of federal wildland firefighting forces into a single program under the Interior Department, shifting thousands of firefighters from the Forest Service in the middle of peak wildfire season. Experts say the move is costly, disruptive, and could worsen fire risks.Why It Matters: This is reckless and dangerous. Trump is reshaping wildfire response during fire season with no plan, no budget, and no mention of climate change, risking more destruction.Source: The GuardianGOP Backs Deep Job Cuts at VA and PentagonWhat Happened: House Republicans advanced spending bills that would purge up to 45,000 civilian Pentagon jobs and 83,000 VA positions. The plan, backed by Musk\u2019s initiative, targets career staff for mass removal. A Democratic effort to block the VA firings was voted down.Why It Matters: These cuts would gut veterans\u2019 healthcare and hollow out national defense. Behind the rhetoric of reform, Trump\u2019s team is executing a systematic purge\u2014crippling public institutions while consolidating control.Source: Military.comShattered Science: The Research Lost as Trump Targets NIH FundingWhat Happened: Trump has terminated more than 1,450 NIH biomedical research grants worth over $750 million, targeting studies related to HIV, cancer, maternal health, mental illness, and LGBTQ+ care. Officials claim the projects were \u201cduplicative\u201d or misaligned with agency priorities, while bypassing the NIH\u2019s normal review process.Why It Matters: The cuts have devastated scientific progress, with researchers forced to abandon clinical trials, lay off staff, and leave studies unfinished. Experts warn the politically motivated purge will delay medical breakthroughs, deepen health disparities, and cost lives.Source: ProPublicaHead of FEMA\u2019s Storm Response Center Resigns Amid Mass Exodus and Trump Policy ShiftWhat Happened: Jeremy Greenberg, head of FEMA\u2019s National Response Coordination Center, is resigning just weeks into hurricane season, joining a growing wave of senior officials leaving the agency. The resignations come as Trump calls to \"wean\" states off FEMA and push disaster response to the state level.Why It Matters: The loss of top leadership at FEMA, coupled with Trump's push to weaken federal disaster aid, threatens the nation\u2019s ability to respond to hurricanes, wildfires, and other crises. This will leave millions vulnerable amid escalating climate disasters and during hurricane season.Source: CBS NewsTrump Withdraws From Tribal Salmon AgreementWhat Happened: Trump has unilaterally canceled a Biden-era agreement with Native American tribes aimed at restoring salmon in the Pacific Northwest. The deal had paused decades of litigation over dams blocking fish migration in the Columbia River Basin and provided $360 million in restoration and clean energy funds.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move revives a bitter legal fight and severs a rare federal-tribal compromise. Tribes say this is yet another broken promise and betrayal of treaty obligations. The White House falsely framed the issue as a climate hoax, ignoring treaty rights, ecological warnings, and tribal sovereignty.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchCzech Leader Calls on Trump to Give Europe More Time to RearmWhat Happened: Czech President Petr Pavel called on the U.S. to give Europe more time and realistic goals to boost defense spending and prepare for a future with less American security support. While supporting higher NATO spending, he cautioned Trump not to pressure allies too aggressively ahead of the NATO summit. Pavel also criticized Trump\u2019s unwillingness to confront Russia or increase pressure on the Kremlin.Why It Matters: As Trump flirts with abandoning NATO commitments, European leaders are rushing to close the defense gap. Pavel\u2019s remarks reflect growing concern that Trump is weakening Western unity against Russia while laying the groundwork for postwar deals with the Kremlin\u2014as Europe sounds the alarm that Russia is preparing an attack on a NATO country. Source: BloombergIran Announces New Nuclear Enrichment Site After UN CensureWhat Happened: Just hours after being censured by the IAEA for failing to meet nuclear commitments, Iran announced a third uranium enrichment site and plans to upgrade centrifuges to boost production. The move came shortly before Israeli airstrikes hit Iranian nuclear targets. While the U.S. has pushed for negotiations, it is also preparing for possible escalation.Why It Matters: Iran is edging closer to a nuclear breakout while U.S. strategy veers between diplomacy and crisis control. With Israeli airstrikes escalating and Tehran accelerating enrichment, the region is moving toward war, while the U.S. has no coherent policy to prevent it.Source: Associated PressWhat\u2019s at Stake If Trump Scraps Security Pact With UK, AustraliaWhat Happened: Trump is reconsidering U.S. support for the AUKUS pact with Australia and the UK, which includes helping Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines to counter China. Officials argue the deal may conflict with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda and are demanding major increases in allied defense spending. The review has alarmed Australian leaders who have already committed billions based on the agreement.Why It Matters: Scrapping AUKUS would gut a key Indo-Pacific alliance and betray America\u2019s closest partners, just as China grows more aggressive. It would deal a blow to regional stability, weaken deterrence, and signal to allies that U.S. security commitments can\u2019t be trusted.Source: BloombergHegseth testifies Pentagon has \"plans for any contingency\" when asked about taking over Greenland by forceWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth told Congress that the Pentagon has \u201cplans for any contingency,\u201d including potential military takeovers of Greenland and Panama. When Rep. Adam Smith asked if this meant invading Denmark, Hegseth did not deny it, saying planners prepare for \u201cwhatever\u2019s needed.\u201d A Republican lawmaker attempted to walk back the remarks, but Hegseth stood by the broad scope of Pentagon planning. Trump has previously declared, \u201cWe\u2019ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%.\u201dWhy It Matters: This stunning admission reveals how Trump is carrying out military planning to illegally seize foreign territory, evoking imperial ambitions and undermining U.S. credibility and respect for sovereignty.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchUS Marks Russia Day for First Time Since Invasion of UkraineWhat Happened: The State Department congratulated Russia on its national holiday, breaking from past policy since Russia\u2019s full-scale 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The statement expressed support for the Russian people and called for \u201cconstructive engagement.\u201d Why It Matters: As Russia escalates its genocidal assault on civilians in Ukraine, the U.S. is congratulating Moscow\u2014rewarding war crimes with diplomacy. It\u2019s grotesque, highlights complicity, and abandons any claim to moral leadership on the world stage.Source: BloombergRussia is amplifying conspiracy theories about the L.A. protestsWhat Happened: Russian state media and pro-Kremlin accounts are flooding social media with disinformation about the Los Angeles protests, echoing U.S. far-right conspiracy theories. Fabricated claims include that Mexico is orchestrating the protests, the CIA and Democrats are staging unrest, and the demonstrations are part of a socialist \u201ccoup attempt\u201d against Trump.Why It Matters: This is hybrid warfare in action\u2014Russia continues weaponizing unrest to deepen divisions and legitimize Trump\u2019s crackdowns. By framing dissent as foreign sabotage, Moscow aids Trump\u2019s narrative, undermines U.S. civil society, and sows chaos.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsUS household wealth dropped in first quarter as tariff concerns hit stocksWhat Happened: U.S. household wealth fell by $1.6 trillion in Q1 2025, the first decline in over a year, driven by a $2.3 trillion plunge in stock holdings and a dip in real estate value. The drop was fueled by investor fears that Trump\u2019s tariffs would spark inflation or recession.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies are destabilizing markets and eroding American wealth. Economists warn this may be a preview of deeper financial volatility.Source: ReutersDollar Slides to Three-Year Low While FTSE 100 Hits Record HighWhat Happened: The U.S. dollar fell to its weakest level in over three years following Trump\u2019s renewed tariff threats and signs of a slowing economy, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a record high. Currency traders shifted to the yen and euro, and investors began looking outside the U.S. amid market uncertainty.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policies and weakening economic indicators are eroding global confidence in the U.S. economy, driving capital toward more stable markets. The dollar\u2019s sharp decline and growing investor flight reiterates diminishing faith in American leadership.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News50501 EventsCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Protesters in Chicago return to the streets.What Happened: Hundreds gathered in downtown Chicago to protest Trump\u2019s immigration policies.

The lawsuit argues Trump\u2019s move, made without the governor\u2019s consent, violates constitutional limits and escalates fear.Source: New York TimesRussian Scientist Released After Four Months in U.S. CustodyWhat Happened: Kseniia Petrova, a Russian researcher at Harvard, was released on bail after spending four months in U.S. detention for failing to declare frog embryo samples at customs. Despite admitting the mistake, she faces deportation and federal smuggling charges carrying up to 20 years in prison. Judges have questioned the legal basis of the case, calling the samples harmless.Source: New York TimesCalifornia and 10 States Sue Trump Over 2035 EV RollbackWhat Happened: California and ten other states filed a lawsuit against Trump after he signed resolutions repealing EPA waivers that allowed California to ban gas-only vehicle sales by 2035.

It\\u2019s backed by David Sacks, the Winklevoss twins, Donald Trump Jr., and is legally run by Sacks\\u2019s longtime business partner, Glenn Gilmore.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More blatant pay-to-play corruption.

Promoted via Trumpcard.gov, it promises green card-style residency with Trump\\u2019s face on it and no Congressional approval required.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is selling U.S. residency like a luxury product.

Governor Gavin Newsom is suing to block the move, calling it unconstitutional. Legal experts warn it dangerously skirts the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues testing the legal limits of military power on U.S. soil. If allowed to stand, this sets a chilling precedent, eroding the line between civilian protest and military force, and opening the door to control through armed federal intervention\\u2014as seen in Russia and other authoritarian countries.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-deployment-troops-la-prompts-host-legal-questions/story?id=122692795\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Calls Fed Chair \\u2018Numbskull,\\u2019 Threatens to \\u2018Force Something\\u2019 on Interest Rates</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> At a bill signing event, Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a \\u201Cnumbskull\\u201D and accusing him of stalling rate cuts. Trump claimed the U.S. could save hundreds of billions if Powell acted and hinted he might \\u201Cforce something\\u201D on the Fed, though he didn\\u2019t clarify what that meant.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s repeated threats signal a dangerous move to erode the Federal Reserve\\u2019s independence, long seen as a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability.

Gavin Newsom. However, active-duty Marines deployed nearby remain under federal control for now. The Ninth Circuit temporarily blocked the ruling from taking effect pending appeal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The judge called it a dangerous overreach that threatens democracy and public safety.

He\\u2019s also hinting at broader crackdowns nationwide.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is militarizing dissent, testing authoritarian tools, and exploiting patriotic imagery to justify political control.

Video shows Padilla identifying himself as a U.S. Senator and shouting \\u201Chands off!\\u201D as he was pinned to the ground and handcuffed. DHS lied that he failed to identify himself and posed a \\u201Cthreat.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> A sitting U.S. senator was manhandled and silenced for demanding accountability, while Congresswoman McIver was recently indicted, a mayor arrested, and judges hauled away.

The move is being framed as a crackdown on \\u201Coutside agitators,\\u201D possibly by \\u201Cforeign adversaries.\\u201D Trump baselessly claimed California officials paid protesters, then later walked back the statement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More abuse of power and weaponizing of agencies\\u2014using the IRS to hunt political enemies and intimidate dissenters. It weaponizes financial surveillance against protest movements and mirrors tactics used by authoritarian regimes to crush opposition.

The draft directive outlines over a dozen potential charges, including statutes previously used against January 6 insurrectionists, and encourages publicizing arrests with press releases. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signaled \\u201Czero tolerance\\u201D for protest-related offenses.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s DOJ continues laying the groundwork to equate peaceful protest with \\u201Cinsurrection\\u201D and \\u201Crebellion,\\u201D using legal threats to intimidate dissent.

The drones are capturing aerial footage\\u2014some of which DHS has posted online with inflammatory captions. Officials insist it\\u2019s for \\u201Csituational awareness,\\u201D but this amounts to militarized surveillance of civilians.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is normalizing the use of wartime surveillance tech against Americans. Deploying military-grade drones to monitor protests pushes the U.S. toward authoritarian territory.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://time.com/7293743/drones-los-angeles-protests-law-enforcement/\\\\\\\">TIME</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Hegseth Won\\u2019t Commit to Following Court Order on LA Troop Deployment</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Pete Hegseth refused to say whether he would comply with a federal court order if it rules that Trump\\u2019s deployment of troops to Los Angeles is illegal. Pressed by lawmakers, Hegseth dodged questions and dismissed district court authority over \\u201Cnational security decisions.\\u201D </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> When the Defense Secretary won\\u2019t commit to obeying court orders, it signals a dangerous erosion of civilian oversight and the rule of law.

The cuts slash $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $1 billion from global health, HIV, and refugee programs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is gutting public media and humanitarian aid to weaken institutions that inform, support, and connect communities at home and abroad.

In a press conference, Ivey stated, \\u201CWe will kill you, graveyard dead,\\u201D if protesters throw bricks or firebombs and threatened severe physical retaliation for even spitting on law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The sheriff\\u2019s insane threats normalize the use of violent rhetoric and mark a dangerous turn toward authoritarian policing. When officials threaten protesters with lethal force, it erodes the rule of law and trust.

Prosecutors suspected Bukele\\u2019s allies cut deals with MS-13 for political gain. Now aligned with Bukele on mass deportations, Trump has deprioritized the case, and two MS-13 indictments are being dismissed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is protecting an authoritarian ally by derailing a major terrorism and corruption case.

A Democratic effort to block the VA firings was voted down.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These cuts would gut veterans\\u2019 healthcare and hollow out national defense.

Officials claim the projects were \\u201Cduplicative\\u201D or misaligned with agency priorities, while bypassing the NIH\\u2019s normal review process.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The cuts have devastated scientific progress, with researchers forced to abandon clinical trials, lay off staff, and leave studies unfinished.

The resignations come as Trump calls to \\\\\\\"wean\\\\\\\" states off FEMA and push disaster response to the state level.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The loss of top leadership at FEMA, coupled with Trump's push to weaken federal disaster aid, threatens the nation\\u2019s ability to respond to hurricanes, wildfires, and other crises.

While supporting higher NATO spending, he cautioned Trump not to pressure allies too aggressively ahead of the NATO summit. Pavel also criticized Trump\\u2019s unwillingness to confront Russia or increase pressure on the Kremlin.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As Trump flirts with abandoning NATO commitments, European leaders are rushing to close the defense gap. Pavel\\u2019s remarks reflect growing concern that Trump is weakening Western unity against Russia while laying the groundwork for postwar deals with the Kremlin\\u2014as Europe sounds the alarm that Russia is preparing an attack on a NATO country. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/czech-leader-calls-on-trump-to-give-europe-more-time-to-rearm\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Iran Announces New Nuclear Enrichment Site After UN Censure</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Just hours after being censured by the IAEA for failing to meet nuclear commitments, Iran announced a third uranium enrichment site and plans to upgrade centrifuges to boost production. The move came shortly before Israeli airstrikes hit Iranian nuclear targets. While the U.S. has pushed for negotiations, it is also preparing for possible escalation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Iran is edging closer to a nuclear breakout while U.S. strategy veers between diplomacy and crisis control. With Israeli airstrikes escalating and Tehran accelerating enrichment, the region is moving toward war, while the U.S. has no coherent policy to prevent it.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-sanctions-728b811da537abe942682e13a82ff8bd\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>What\\u2019s at Stake If Trump Scraps Security Pact With UK, Australia</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is reconsidering U.S. support for the AUKUS pact with Australia and the UK, which includes helping Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines to counter China. Officials argue the deal may conflict with Trump\\u2019s \\u201CAmerica First\\u201D agenda and are demanding major increases in allied defense spending. The review has alarmed Australian leaders who have already committed billions based on the agreement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Scrapping AUKUS would gut a key Indo-Pacific alliance and betray America\\u2019s closest partners, just as China grows more aggressive. It would deal a blow to regional stability, weaken deterrence, and signal to allies that U.S. security commitments can\\u2019t be trusted.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/what-is-aukus-what-happens-if-trump-scraps-it\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Hegseth testifies Pentagon has \\\\\\\"plans for any contingency\\\\\\\" when asked about taking over Greenland by force</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Pete Hegseth told Congress that the Pentagon has \\u201Cplans for any contingency,\\u201D including potential military takeovers of Greenland and Panama.
