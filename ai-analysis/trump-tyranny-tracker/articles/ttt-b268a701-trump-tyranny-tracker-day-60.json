Photo: will oliver/ShutterstockShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 20Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Offers $100 to Wisconsin Voters, Reviving Controversial TacticWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC is offering $100 to Wisconsin voters who sign a petition against \"activist judges,\" aiming to mobilize conservative voters ahead of the April 1 Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The PAC has already spent $11 million backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a Trump ally.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s cash-for-signatures strategy mirrors his 2024 election efforts, which faced legal challenges over potential election interference. The petition serves as a data-gathering tool to identify likely Republican voters. Additionally, Musk has personal stakes in Wisconsin, with Tesla suing the state over dealership restrictions.Source: The New York TimesConnolly calls for investigation into Lutnick encouraging Americans to buy Tesla stockWhat Happened: Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) has called for an investigation into Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after he urged Americans to buy Tesla stock on Fox News. Connolly argues this violates ethics rules.Why It Matters: This is part of broader concerns about Musk\u2019s unchecked influence and power in the Trump regime while personally profiting from federal contracts and policy decisions. Connolly has requested financial disclosures, internal communications, and ethics records to determine if Lutnick\u2019s remarks broke government rules.Source: The HillInterior to open millions of acres in Alaska to drilling and miningWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Interior Department is gutting environmental protections, opening 82% of Alaska\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve, and reinstating drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump is also approving a pipeline and mining road, reversing Biden-era restrictions.Why It Matters: Massive land giveaway to Big Oil and mining companies at the expense of Indigenous communities and Arctic wildlife. Conservationists call it destructive, while oil execs and Republicans celebrate deregulation.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMusk Set to Get Access to Top-Secret U.S. War Plan for ChinaWhat Happened: The Pentagon is set to brief Musk on the U.S. military\u2019s classified operational plan for a potential war with China. Musk, who has extensive business ties to China and leads SpaceX\u2014one of the Pentagon\u2019s largest contractors\u2014is expected to receive details on military strategy, potential targets, and force deployment.Why It Matters: This is a major national security risk. Granting Musk access to highly classified military strategies raises serious concerns about conflicts of interest, potential intelligence leaks, and foreign influence over U.S. defense policy\u2014especially given China pouring billions into his businesses and the ability to pressure him through Tesla\u2019s operations.Source: The New York TimesAdministration\u2019s Details on Deportation Flights \u2018Woefully Insufficient,\u2019 Judge SaysWhat Happened: A federal judge blasted Trump for failing to comply with a court order pausing the deportation of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department\u2019s response was deemed \u201cwoefully insufficient,\u201d and the judge warned of potential contempt charges.Why It Matters: This is blatant defiance of the judiciary. Trump is testing the limits of executive power, ignoring court rulings, and pushing the U.S. toward a constitutional crisis. If unchecked, this sets a dangerous precedent for lawless governance.Source: The New York TimesDOGE Moves to Dismantle Library and Museum Funding AgencyWhat Happened: Trump appointed Keith E. Sonderling as acting director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services after issuing an executive order to eliminate the agency. Musk\u2019s operatives arrived at IMLS headquarters Thursday, signaling imminent cuts.Why It Matters: The IMLS funds workforce training, rural internet access, and museum grants\u2014but its $266 million budget is now in jeopardy. Libraries warn of cuts to digital services, and museums say there's no efficiency argument when they generate $50 billion in economic impact while IMLS accounts for just 0.0046% of the federal budget. The agency\u2019s staff expects mass suspensions by the weekend.Source: NPR\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Signs Executive Order to Dismantle Education DepartmentWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, shifting authority to states. The move triggered mass layoffs and uncertainty over student loans, special education, and civil rights protections.Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented attack on public education. Cutting federal oversight threatens funding for low-income schools, students with disabilities, and Pell Grants\u2014while gutting protections for marginalized students. Source: CNNTrump Wants USAID on the BlockchainWhat Happened: Trump plans to rename USAID as the U.S. International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) and place it under the State Department\u2019s control. A leaked memo reveals plans to use blockchain technology to track aid distribution, though details remain unclear. Experts warn this is a \u201cfake technological solution\u201d that offers no real advantage over existing systems.Why It Matters: This move is part of Trump and Musk\u2019s agenda to gut USAID while pretending to modernize it. Humanitarian groups fear critical aid programs will continue to be disrupted under the guise of blockchain \u201cefficiency,\u201d leaving vulnerable populations without support.Source: WIREDDuffy provides 30-day New York City congestion pricing extension, puts Hochul \u2018on notice\u2019What Happened: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy granted New York City a 30-day extension on its congestion pricing plan, accusing Gov. Kathy Hochul of \"disrespecting\" the federal government. Trump is demanding an end to the program, arguing it unfairly taxes working-class commuters.Why It Matters: This escalates tensions between federal and state authorities, with Hochul vowing to fight in court and defending congestion pricing as effective in reducing traffic and boosting local business. The regime\u2019s threat to withhold federal funds highlights a major federal overreach into state policy.Source: The HillDOJ reduces ADA compliance guidance, pointing to Trump\u2019s orderWhat Happened: The Department of Justice removed 11 ADA compliance guidelines, cutting regulations for businesses, hospitals, and public accommodations under the guise of reducing costs. The move follows Trump\u2019s January order aimed at deregulation, though it did not specifically target the Americans with Disabilities Act.Why It Matters: Disability advocates warn this will increase barriers in public spaces, reduce accessibility enforcement, and undermine civil rights protections. Source: The HillDOJ Moves to Shield Trump From Jan. 6 LawsuitsWhat Happened: The Justice Department filed court papers arguing that Trump acted in his official capacity as president on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to replace him as the defendant in lawsuits brought by Capitol Police officers and lawmakers injured in the attack. This maneuver could prevent Trump from facing legal or financial liability for his role in inciting the insurrection.Why It Matters: If successful, this move would block one of the last remaining legal efforts to hold Trump accountable for Jan. 6 after two criminal cases against him collapsed. Source: The New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Rescinds Executive Order After Law Firm Pledges $40M in Free ServicesWhat Happened: Trump revoked an executive order targeting Paul, Weiss, a Democratic-leaning law firm, after it agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services supporting his regime. The order initially threatened to suspend security clearances for the firm\u2019s attorneys and terminate federal contracts.Why It Matters: This is extortion, plain and simple. Trump is forcing corporations to bend to his agenda, using federal power to coerce law firms, tech giants, and media companies into eliminating DEI programs and making politically motivated concessions. Meta, ABC, and others have already paid settlements or rolled back DEI policies to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Crackdown on Universities Forces a Choice: Surrender or FightWhat\u2019s Happening: Trump is pressuring universities by threatening to cut millions in federal funds unless they comply with ideological demands. Columbia University faces a $400M funding freeze unless it disciplines pro-Palestinian protesters, revamps admissions, and places an academic department under outside control. UPenn lost $175M over its trans athlete policy.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian takeover of higher education. Universities face blatant First Amendment violations but few are fighting back\u2014some fear retaliation, others may secretly welcome Trump\u2019s pressure to push controversial policies. Academic freedom, free speech, and institutional independence are on the chopping block.Source: The GuardianTrump Calls for Judge\u2019s Impeachment, White House Backs Him Amid Power GrabWhat\u2019s Happening: Trump is demanding the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg after he blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, a move legal experts call unconstitutional. The White House supports Trump's attack on the judiciary, despite rare pushback from Chief Justice John Roberts, who warned impeachment isn\u2019t a tool for policy disputes.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian attempt to undermine judicial independence. Trump\u2019s continued defiance of court rulings and calls for judges' removals highlight a predictable and dangerous escalation against the rule of law. Source: The GuardianUniversities are caving to Trump with a stunning speed and scopeWhat Happened: Colleges across the U.S. are rapidly caving to Trump\u2019s demands to slash progressive policies, crack down on student activism, and implement conservative reforms. Columbia University is poised to comply, while other institutions are eliminating diversity programs, hiring GOP-aligned leaders, and restricting student protests to avoid financial retaliation.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal funding as a weapon to reshape higher education into a conservative stronghold, threatening academic freedom, student activism, and research programs. Universities that resist risk losing crucial federal grants and student aid, forcing them into compliance. This is an authoritarian takeover of higher education.Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Officials Claim Wartime Law Allows Warrantless Home RaidsWhat Happened: Trump lawyers argue that the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grants immigration agents the authority to enter homes without warrants to apprehend suspected Venezuelan \u201cgang members.\u201d This interpretation overrides the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections against unlawful searches.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on civil liberties, setting a dangerous precedent for warrantless home raids. Legal experts warn this move echoes historical abuses and will expand unchecked government power beyond immigration enforcement.Source: The New York TimesMan Deported Under Alien Enemies Act Over Soccer Tattoo, Lawyer SaysWhat Happened: Jerce Reyes Barrios, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and anti-Maduro protester, was deported under the Alien Enemies Act after U.S. immigration officials accused him of being a \u201cgang member.\u201d His attorney provided evidence that the so-called gang tattoo was a Real Madrid soccer logo and that Barrios had no criminal record. Why It Matters: This is a blatant case of wrongful deportation under Trump\u2019s misuse of wartime powers. The regime is disappearing migrants without due process, with ICE admitting that \u201cmany\u201d deportees had no U.S. criminal record. Deporting innocent people based on arbitrary evidence\u2014like a soccer tattoo\u2014sets a chilling precedent.Source: ABC NewsIntelligence Assessment Said to Contradict Trump on Venezuelan GangWhat Happened: Trump used the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans without due process, claiming Maduro\u2019s government-controlled gang Tren de Aragua. However, a U.S. intelligence assessment concluded this is not true. Only the FBI dissented, while most agencies, including the CIA and NSA, found no credible link.Why It Matters: Trump falsified national security claims to justify an illegal mass deportation, violating judicial orders and expanding authoritarian immigration policies. The move pushes the U.S. toward a constitutional crisis over executive power abuse.Source: The New York TimesDeported Colombian-Venezuelan Migrant Has No Gang Ties, Wife SaysWhat Happened: Andres Guillermo Morales, a Colombian-Venezuelan dual citizen, was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador. His wife, Deicy Aldana, insists he has no criminal record in any country and had a legal work permit in the United States as part of his U.S. asylum application when he was arrested and that his deportation is a violation of his rights.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportations face increasing legal scrutiny. Judge James Boasberg has ordered Trump to justify the expulsions, while families report that ICE wrongly linked tattoos to gang affiliations. Aldana vows to fight for her husband\u2019s release.Source: ReutersTrump Sends a New Group of Migrants to Guant\u00e1namo BayWhat Happened: Trump transferred another 20 migrants to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, claiming they have ties to Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but offered no evidence. This follows previous secret deportations of 177 migrants to Honduras and a court hearing where Trump\u2019s team emptied the base to avoid legal scrutiny.Why It Matters: Trump is disappearing migrants in secrecy, using a military prison notorious for housing terror suspects\u2014without due process or proof of criminal activity. This mirrors authoritarian disappearances, where individuals are removed without accountability under the guise of \u201cnational security.\u201dSource: The New York TimesTrump and Hegseth Erase Black and Latino Veterans from Military HistoryWhat Happened: The Pentagon deleted memorial pages for Black, Latino, and women service members from Arlington National Cemetery\u2019s website. This follows Hegseth\u2019s directive to remove content related to \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\u201d Among those erased were tributes to Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr. and the Tuskegee Airmen.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just an attack on diversity\u2014it\u2019s an attempt to rewrite military history and erase the contributions of Black, Latino, and women veterans. Trump and Hegseth are dishonoring the sacrifices of those who fought for America while enabling the whitewashing of the armed forces.Source: Rolling StoneAmerican Manufacturer of Life-Saving Baby Food Hit by USAID Funding CutsWhat Happened: Edesia Nutrition, a Rhode Island-based producer of therapeutic food for malnourished babies, was forced to lay off 10% of its workforce after USAID rejected two of its invoices, despite its contract surviving a massive foreign aid purge. The funding delay has halted production and affected its American supply chain, including farmers and manufacturers.Why It Matters: Trump, Musk, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have disrupted funding, crippling global health nonprofits and delaying critical food aid. Plumpy'Nut, Edesia\u2019s product, feeding famine-stricken children in South Sudan before shipments were stopped. Source: CBS NewsTrump Erases Indigenous Crisis Report, Undermining Vital ProtectionsWhat Happened: Trump removed the Not Invisible Act Commission\u2019s final report from federal websites, erasing critical research on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples crisis. This historic document, compiled through nationwide hearings, provided crucial data and policy recommendations to address violence against Native communities.Why It Matters: The move is part of a broader effort to erase Indigenous issues from public records\u2014federal agencies have even flagged terms like \u201cNative American\u201d and \u201ctribal\u201d for removal. Advocates warn that Native women will die without federal funding and resources, as Indigenous people face disproportionate rates of violence, abduction, and murder.Source: The GuardianTrump Orders Military to Purge Pentagon Websites, Erasing Historical RecordsWhat Happened: The Pentagon conducted a rushed mass purge of its public-facing websites, ordering the removal of DEI-related content. Military units were told to search and delete content using broad keyword searches like \u201chistory,\u201d \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201cprivilege,\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s purge erased key military history\u2014first Black general, first female Ranger, WWII Medal of Honor tributes, Holocaust remembrance, suicide prevention, and Navajo code talkers. Denied extensions led to permanent loss of records, violating federal laws. Now, the Pentagon is scrambling to recover data, exposing Trump\u2019s reckless, authoritarian military overhaul.Source: CNNBorder Agents Use More Aggressive Tactics to Question Visa Holders, TouristsWhat Happened: U.S. border agents are detaining and aggressively interrogating visa holders and tourists, shackling travelers, denying access to lawyers, and even strip-searching detainees. German, Canadian, and other foreign nationals have been caught in the crackdown, with some held for weeks without charges.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme vetting\u201d order is fueling unprecedented border abuses, deterring foreign travelers, and causing diplomatic backlash. Universities and businesses are warning visa holders to avoid U.S. travel as immigration policies grow more hostile and unpredictable.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s Cuts Signal End to Government Work on Terrorism PreventionWhat Happened: Trump has slashed or frozen tens of millions of dollars in terrorism prevention grants, forcing critical programs to shut down. Musk has gutted funding for community-based interventions, security programs for religious institutions, and violence prevention initiatives. Experts warn this is the government abandoning its role in counterterrorism.Why It Matters: Mass layoffs and program shutdowns have crippled efforts to prevent mass shootings, white supremacist violence, and Islamic extremism. DHS now prioritizes immigration enforcement over national security. Jewish security programs were defunded despite rising antisemitism, and school shooting prevention efforts were abruptly canceled.Source: ProPublicaSocial Security Declared Seattle Man Dead\u2014While He\u2019s Very Much AliveWhat Happened: 82-year-old Ned Johnson was mistakenly marked as deceased by the Social Security Administration, leading to canceled benefits, Medicare termination, and financial chaos. It took him nearly three weeks and multiple visits to an overwhelmed SSA office to prove he was alive and start reclaiming his funds.Why It Matters: This exposes the deep dysfunction at SSA under Musk\u2019s gutting of the agency. Offices are understaffed, errors are rampant, and seniors relying on Social Security are left in financial limbo\u2014sometimes declared \u201cdead\u201d with no explanation.Source: The Seattle Times90-Year-Old Veteran Declared Dead, Struggles to Restore Social Security BenefitsWhat Happened: Tom Kind, a 90-year-old veteran, was wrongly marked as deceased by the Social Security Administration, causing him to lose his benefits, healthcare coverage, and access to his bank account. Despite multiple attempts, he has been unable to fix the error for over 10 days.Why It Matters: SSA\u2019s bureaucratic failures under Musk\u2019s cuts leave vulnerable seniors without critical benefits. With offices understaffed and customer service in chaos, elderly Americans are being wrongfully erased from the system\u2014and struggling to prove they are still alive.Source: 9 News DenverTrump\u2019s VA Overhaul Guts Mental Health Services for VeteransWhat Happened: Trump fired 2,400 VA employees, with plans to cut 80,000 more, while banning remote work. The move has led to canceled mental health appointments, crisis hotline confusion, and increased wait times for veterans, many of whom suffer from PTSD and substance abuse.Why It Matters: Veterans\u2019 mental health care is collapsing under staffing shortages, with suicide rates already twice the national average. Rushed cuts and bans on telehealth are leaving vets without life-saving services, fueling anxiety among both providers and vets.Source: Reuters'We Don\u2019t Want an AI Demo, We Want Answers\u2019: Federal Workers Grill Trump Appointee During All-HandsWhat Happened: General Services Administration employees confronted Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian over job cuts, budget restrictions, and the agency\u2019s shift to AI tools. Employees expressed frustration over Musk\u2019s control, forced office returns, and lost access to critical software, while Ehikian avoided direct answers and instead showcased an AI chatbot.Why It Matters: Federal workers are in open revolt as Trump\u2019s cronies gut the government under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201d The backlash highlights widespread fear of mass layoffs, diminished public services, and the increasing use of AI to justify cost-cutting and job elimination.Source: WIREDJFK Files Release Exposes Social Security Numbers of Former StaffersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s rushed declassification of JFK assassination records accidentally exposed the Social Security numbers and personal data of 200+ former congressional staffers, including at least two living individuals, one of whom is Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Joseph diGenova. The National Archives and Social Security Administration are now scrambling to contain the fallout.Why It Matters: A stunning display of government incompetence. In its reckless push for \"transparency,\" the Trump regime exposed elderly former staffers to identity theft, jeopardizing their privacy and security. And, these are the same people stealing our sensitive data.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s NIH Cuts Quietly Gut Workforce, Threatening ResearchWhat Happened: The NIH has stopped renewing contracts for many of its employees, who make up nearly half of its workforce. The lapse follows a temporary HHS communication ban, leaving contract workers jobless with no clarity on renewals.Why It Matters: The cuts cripple key research programs, with scientists and technicians being forced out. Many affected are foreign nationals, risking deportation if they can\u2019t secure new jobs. The move aligns with RFK Jr.\u2019s push to cripple the NIH, further weakening U.S. scientific research.Source: NOTUSTrump\u2019s NWS Cuts Threaten U.S. Weather ForecastingWhat Happened: The National Weather Service indefinitely suspended weather balloon launches in Nebraska, South Dakota, and other states due to staffing shortages. Twice-daily launches will also be cut to once per day in multiple regions.Why It Matters: Weather balloons provide critical atmospheric data for forecast accuracy, especially during extreme weather like tornadoes and storms. Experts warn this will lead to a slow degradation in the ability to predict severe weather, risking public safety.Source: NOTUS\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUK Issues Travel Warning for US Amid Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: The United Kingdom has updated its travel advisory for the United States, warning British citizens about strict enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. This follows Germany\u2019s similar warning, issued yesterday after three of its citizens were detained at the U.S. border. The UK Foreign Office cautioned travelers to comply fully with entry rules to avoid arrest or detention.Why It Matters: U.S. allies are now warning their citizens about traveling to the U.S. because of Trump's extreme immigration crackdown. Foreign nationals are being detained despite valid visas or ESTA approvals. The U.S. now arbitrarily decides who gets in, fueling fears of unpredictable enforcement at the border. Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Pressures Ukraine Over Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant What Happened: In a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump suggested the U.S. take ownership of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear power plants, particularly the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Zelenskyy reaffirmed that all nuclear plants belong to the Ukrainian people.Why It Matters: Trump is once again using Ukraine as a bargaining chip\u2014first extorting mineral rights, now floating a U.S. takeover of a nuclear plant. Given his pro-Russia stance, this raises concerns that he's laying the groundwork to carve up Ukraine with Russia while Ukraine is left to bleed. The ZNPP is a critical leverage point in negotiations, and Trump's meddling aligns disturbingly with Russia\u2019s territorial and energy ambitions.Source: Associated PressU.S. Intelligence Contradicts Trump-Putin Claim on Ukrainian Forces in KurskWhat Happened: U.S. and European intelligence assessments confirm that Ukrainian troops in Kursk are not encircled, contradicting claims made by Trump and Putin. Intelligence agencies, including the CIA, have provided this information to the White House, but Trump continues to peddle Putin\u2019s lies.Why It Matters: Putin\u2019s claims are disinformation aimed at pressuring Ukraine into negotiations on Russia\u2019s terms. Trump\u2019s parroting of Russian propaganda, yet again, reiterates his alignment with Moscow.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Trade Policies Shake Global EconomyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariff upheaval is causing economic uncertainty, forcing foreign central banks to reassess policies. The Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank have all warned about the impact, with the IMF forecasting potential recessions in Canada and Mexico.Why It Matters: Analysts predict weaker U.S. growth and rising inflation, increasing risks of a global economic slowdown. Trump\u2019s planned 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada could further disrupt global trade and financial stability.Source: ReutersTesla Trade-Ins Surge Amid Musk-Trump BacklashWhat Happened: Tesla trade-ins hit a record high, with 1.4% of all vehicle trade-ins in March, up from 0.4% last year, as backlash grows over Musk. Activists are staging \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protests, and Tesla stocks are falling.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unpopularity erodes brand loyalty, with Tesla stock nearly halving since January. This shift allows competitors like Ford and Hyundai to capture former Tesla owners.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News'Hitting a fly with a sledgehammer': Judge blocks DOGE from accessing sensitive Social Security recordsWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that FAKE unauthorized DOGE violated privacy laws by accessing millions of Americans\u2019 Social Security records without justification. The ruling blocks DOGE from further access and orders the destruction of improperly obtained data. This is the data Musk and his operatives are collecting on all Americans.Source: ABC News and Court DecisionRight-Wing Radio Callers Revolt Against Trump\u2019s PoliciesWhat Happened: Conservative talk radio shows are flooded with calls from frustrated listeners\u2014many identifying as Trump supporters\u2014who are angry about economic instability, government layoffs, Social Security cuts, and Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy.

The spring equinox was yesterday and now the days outstrip the night. The time has arrived for the black tide of the coup to recede back out to the sea of hate and greed that are always there through the centuries.  But enormous damage has been done and we survivors must stiffen our backs and realize we can drain the flooded lands.  The universities and law firms must rise to their feet undaunted by the enormity of the task. The points of resistance nationwide must gain ground for the waters to recede.  We were all made fearful when the tide rolled over us.  Now we must become resolute.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex

The PAC has already spent $11 million backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a Trump ally.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s cash-for-signatures strategy mirrors his 2024 election efforts, which faced legal challenges over potential election interference. The petition serves as a data-gathering tool to identify likely Republican voters.

Gerry Connolly (D-VA) has called for an investigation into Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after he urged Americans to buy Tesla stock on Fox News. Connolly argues this violates ethics rules.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of broader concerns about Musk\\u2019s unchecked influence and power in the Trump regime while personally profiting from federal contracts and policy decisions. Connolly has requested financial disclosures, internal communications, and ethics records to determine if Lutnick\\u2019s remarks broke government rules.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5206684-connolly-investigation-lutnick-tesla-stock/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Interior to open millions of acres in Alaska to drilling and mining</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s Interior Department is gutting environmental protections, opening 82% of Alaska\\u2019s National Petroleum Reserve, and reinstating drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Trump is also approving a pipeline and mining road, reversing Biden-era restrictions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Massive land giveaway to Big Oil and mining companies at the expense of Indigenous communities and Arctic wildlife.

The Justice Department\\u2019s response was deemed \\u201Cwoefully insufficient,\\u201D and the judge warned of potential contempt charges.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is blatant defiance of the judiciary.

Musk\\u2019s operatives arrived at IMLS headquarters Thursday, signaling imminent cuts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The IMLS funds workforce training, rural internet access, and museum grants\\u2014but its $266 million budget is now in jeopardy. Libraries warn of cuts to digital services, and museums say there's no efficiency argument when they generate $50 billion in economic impact while IMLS accounts for just 0.0046% of the federal budget.

A leaked memo reveals plans to use blockchain technology to track aid distribution, though details remain unclear. Experts warn this is a \\u201Cfake technological solution\\u201D that offers no real advantage over existing systems.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move is part of Trump and Musk\\u2019s agenda to gut USAID while pretending to modernize it.

Kathy Hochul of \\\\\\\"disrespecting\\\\\\\" the federal government. Trump is demanding an end to the program, arguing it unfairly taxes working-class commuters.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This escalates tensions between federal and state authorities, with Hochul vowing to fight in court and defending congestion pricing as effective in reducing traffic and boosting local business.

The move follows Trump\\u2019s January order aimed at deregulation, though it did not specifically target the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Disability advocates warn this will increase barriers in public spaces, reduce accessibility enforcement, and undermine civil rights protections. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5205795-justice-department-ada-guidance/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>DOJ Moves to Shield Trump From Jan. 6 Lawsuits</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department filed court papers arguing that Trump acted in his official capacity as president on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to replace him as the defendant in lawsuits brought by Capitol Police officers and lawmakers injured in the attack. This maneuver could prevent Trump from facing legal or financial liability for his role in inciting the insurrection.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If successful, this move would block one of the last remaining legal efforts to hold Trump accountable for Jan. 6 after two criminal cases against him collapsed. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/jan-6-lawsuits.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Rescinds Executive Order After Law Firm Pledges $40M in Free Services</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump revoked an executive order targeting Paul, Weiss, a Democratic-leaning law firm, after it agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services supporting his regime. The order initially threatened to suspend security clearances for the firm\\u2019s attorneys and terminate federal contracts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is extortion, plain and simple. Trump is forcing corporations to bend to his agenda, using federal power to coerce law firms, tech giants, and media companies into eliminating DEI programs and making politically motivated concessions.

Columbia University faces a $400M funding freeze unless it disciplines pro-Palestinian protesters, revamps admissions, and places an academic department under outside control. UPenn lost $175M over its trans athlete policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian takeover of higher education.

The White House supports Trump's attack on the judiciary, despite rare pushback from Chief Justice John Roberts, who warned impeachment isn\\u2019t a tool for policy disputes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian attempt to undermine judicial independence.
