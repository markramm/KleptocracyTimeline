This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct6eN0zD4V-eFBAJgR2zCiIIo4ycjZysrCYixcdDpNfm1c1Q/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsNew York Mayor Eric Adams Led Criminal Enterprise at NYPD, Former Top Cop AllegesWhat Happened: Former NYPD Commissioner Thomas Donlon has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Mayor Eric Adams is operating the NYPD as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d The suit accuses Adams of racketeering, wire fraud, and obstruction, and demands federal oversight of the department.Why It Matters: The lawsuit intensifies corruption concerns surrounding Adams as he seeks re-election. If substantiated, the charges point to deep-rooted criminal conduct within one of America\u2019s largest police departments, directed from the top.Source: Wall Street JournalCritics of Trump's presidential library fundraising say \"there are no rules\"What Happened: Trump is quietly raising hundreds of millions for his future presidential library\u2014accepting a $400M jet bribe from Qatar and reaping up to $63 million from lawsuits\u2014without public transparency. Senators Warren and Blumenthal are pushing legislation to cap donations, ban foreign gifts, and require disclosures.Why It Matters: The fund is a vehicle for influence-peddling while Trump is still in office. With no rules in place, Trump is exploiting library fundraising as a backchannel for favors and policy influence. This creates a legalized bribery pipeline that shapes policy decisions and further undermines trust in government.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Has Draft of Letter to Fire Fed Chair. He Asked Republicans if He Should Send ItWhat Happened: Trump showed House Republicans a draft letter to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asking if he should send it. Although, when asked, he claimed no immediate plans, he has repeatedly attacked Powell for not slashing interest rates and ranted about \u201cfraud\u201d tied to a $2.5 billion Fed building renovation. Why It Matters: Trump is once again threatening the Fed\u2019s independence to gain political control over monetary policy. This would destabilize global markets, bond markets, and break a foundational norm of U.S. economic governance.Source: New York TimesThe IRS Is Building a Vast System to Share Millions of Taxpayers\u2019 Data With ICEWhat Happened: The Trump regime is building an IRS system to give ICE mass access to taxpayer data, including addresses, to speed up deportations. After the IRS counsel refused to release records on 7.3 million people, he was ousted. A leaked blueprint shows plans for an automated system that bypasses privacy safeguards and funnels bulk data to DHS.Why It Matters: This shatters the firewall between tax privacy and law enforcement.  Data that is supposed to be safe and protected is now a tool for mass targeting. As I keep saying, immigrants are a test case for a broader surveillance dragnet that will sweep up anyone. This is how authoritarian systems take root.Source: ProPublica\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDOJ hits states with broad requests for voter rolls, election dataWhat Happened: The DOJ is demanding voter rolls and pressing states to allow inspections of voting machines, sparking alarm across party lines. In Colorado, clerks say a Trump-connected operative linked to Stephen Miller is contacting counties about federal access to machines\u2014something election law forbids. Separately, the DOJ has quietly asked at least 9 states for full voter files, part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to centralize election control.Why It Matters: This is the 2020 coup playbook\u2014on steroids. After years of threats, lawsuits, and lies, Trump\u2019s team is using federal power to lay the groundwork for election interference in 2026. This is a power grab disguised as oversight, threatening to purge voters, intimidate clerks, and dismantle trust in U.S. elections. Source: Washington PostJustice Department Fires Ghislaine Maxwell Prosecutor Maurene ComeyWhat Happened: The DOJ abruptly fired Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and lead prosecutor in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Comey also handled parts of the Epstein and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs cases. No reason was given, but it follows Trump\u2019s attacks on DOJ officials and growing MAGA anger over withheld Epstein files.Why It Matters: This is political revenge and red meat for Trump\u2019s base. By firing Maurene Comey, Trump is targeting prosecutors tied to Epstein while deflecting from demands to release the files. It\u2019s both a purge of independent law enforcement and a calculated distraction to rile up supporters and shield elites.Source: Wall Street JournalUS considered charging Minnesota judges, lawyers in immigration crackdown, sources sayWhat Happened: The Justice Department considered prosecuting Minnesota judges and defense lawyers for requesting virtual court hearings to prevent ICE arrests. Internal emails and legal discussions sparked an FBI probe, though no charges have been filed.Why It Matters: This unprecedented move reveals how Trump\u2019s DOJ continues targeting the legal system\u2014seeking to intimidate judges and defense attorneys for doing their jobs and protecting due process. It would be another dangerous escalation in criminalizing resistance to Trump\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: ReutersDemocratic senators raise concerns about a new Trump citizenship data systemWhat Happened: 3 Democratic senators are sounding the alarm over Trump\u2019s new national citizenship verification system, warning it could wrongly flag eligible citizens and suppress votes. The DHS tool links immigration and Social Security data and is being quietly offered to state election officials without public transparency.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s team is building a centralized database with no oversight\u2014while briefing far-right election denial groups and bypassing Congress. Civil liberties advocates fear it will be weaponized to target naturalized citizens and people of color.Source: NPR900 Ex-Justice Dept. Lawyers Urge Senate Not to Confirm Bove as Federal Appeals JudgeWhat Happened: More than 900 former Justice Department attorneys urged the Senate to reject Trump\u2019s nomination of Emil Bove III to the federal appeals bench, citing his role in dropping charges against Trump allies, purging prosecutors, and instructing them to defy court orders to carry out mass deportations.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s nomination shows Trump is turning the courts into tools of political loyalty. Confirming him would reward obedience over impartial justice\u2014and further erode the line between law and authoritarian enforcement.Source: New York TimesSpurned U.S. Attorney Clings to Job by Being Appointed His Own AssistantWhat Happened: After a panel of federal judges refused to make John Sarcone the permanent U.S. attorney in Albany, the DOJ quietly reappointed him as \u201cspecial attorney to the attorney general,\u201d granting him indefinite authority over the office. The move bypasses Senate confirmation and defies judicial rejection.Why It Matters: The DOJ is warping legal norms to keep subservients in power\u2014no matter their qualifications, conduct, or public rejection. Sarcone\u2019s self-appointment exposes how Trump continues gutting oversight and reshaping the justice system to serve his political agenda.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsNative American radio stations at risk as Congress looks to cut $1B in public broadcasting fundingWhat Happened: Congress is moving to cut $1 billion from public broadcasting, threatening to shut down dozens of Native American radio stations that serve 1.5 million people. These stations are lifelines in remote areas\u2014providing news, weather alerts, and language preservation. Trump is pushing the cuts and warning Republicans not to oppose them.Why It Matters: Tribal communities and many other rural areas will lose their only trusted information source, silencing Native voices and endangering lives across rural America.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDHS Faces New Pressure Over DNA Taken From Immigrant ChildrenWhat Happened: DHS has quietly added the DNA of over 133,000 migrant children and teens to CODIS, the FBI\u2019s criminal database, treating them like future suspects in violent crimes. Senator Ron Wyden is demanding answers, calling it a \u201cchilling expansion\u201d of surveillance powers. At least 227 children were age 13 or younger, with 70% from Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti.Why It Matters: Migrant kids are now tagged for life in a law enforcement system built for rapists and murderers. Once normalized on immigrants, such surveillance is often expanded to citizens.Source: WIREDUS citizen says he was jailed for three days after California immigration raidWhat Happened: George Retes, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran, says he was beaten, tear-gassed, and jailed for three days without charges during a July 10 immigration raid in California. Despite identifying himself and showing proof of employment, DHS agents allegedly ignored him. DHS confirmed his arrest and said federal charges are under review.Why It Matters: This is what authoritarian policing looks like. Under Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, even U.S. citizens are being swept up, abused, and jailed without cause. Constitutional rights are vanishing under the guise of \u201cimmigration enforcement.\u201dSource: ReutersThe Message Is \u2018We Can Take Your Children\u2019What Happened: Trump is systematically rolling back protections for undocumented children, detaining record numbers of minors\u2014including toddlers\u2014for months under harsh new vetting rules. ICE has reopened family detention centers like Dilley, Texas, and is targeting children during traffic stops, raids, and at school. Many face deportation proceedings alone in court.Why It Matters: This is deliberate cruelty. The Trump regime is weaponizing child detention to terrorize immigrant families into \u201cself-deporting.\u201d Legal protections are being dismantled, and the message is clear: no child is safe.Source: The AtlanticUS set to destroy 500 tons of US-taxpayer funded emergency foodWhat Happened: The U.S. is preparing to destroy nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food\u2014high-energy biscuits stored in Dubai and funded by taxpayers\u2014because they expire this month. The aid, which could have saved lives in Gaza or other crisis zones, went unused after Trump\u2019s dismantling of USAID gutted its oversight and planning capacity. Disposal will cost another $100,000.Why It Matters: This is catastrophic waste and cruelty. Trump\u2019s sabotage of USAID has deadly consequences, turning life-saving aid into landfill and flushing taxpayer dollars down the drain.Source: CNNDespite vow to remove the worst offenders, ICE data shows less than 1% of deportees had murder convictionsWhat Happened: Despite vows to focus on violent offenders, less than 1% of the 100,000 people deported under Trump since January had murder convictions. The vast majority were removed for minor infractions like traffic or immigration violations. Only 729 deportees had homicide records, and just 3.3% were identified as gang members or terrorists. Meanwhile, nearly 60% of those detained had no criminal record at all.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine isn\u2019t targeting the \u201cworst\u201d\u2014it\u2019s sweeping up the innocent and nonviolent. The numbers expose the lie behind his crime rhetoric and reveal a mass expulsion campaign weaponized to spread fear and carry out cruelty.Source: CBS NewsThe Chaotic Early Days Inside Florida\u2019s \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 Detention CenterWhat Happened: Detainees at Florida\u2019s Everglades internment camp, Alligator Alcatraz, report hunger, illness, sleepless nights, and no access to lawyers or hygiene. Opened hastily on July 3 for Trump\u2019s mass deportation drive, the swamp-surrounded camp holds hundreds in tents plagued by bugs, flooding, and poor medical care.Why It Matters: This is state-run internment under the guise of immigration enforcement. With no federal oversight or court approval, Florida is modeling a system of mass detention rooted in fear and impunity, while other red states are lining up to copy it.Source: New York TimesUS deports migrants to Eswatini, African country with troubling human rights recordWhat Happened: The U.S. deported 5 migrants to Eswatini, a dictatorship with a record of torture and abuse, under Trump\u2019s revived \u201cthird country\u201d deportation policy. DHS claims the men were \u201cuniquely barbaric,\u201d but offered no evidence.Why It Matters: Trump is fast-tracking deportations to dangerous regimes, bypassing due process and committing human rights violations. Source: The GuardianImmigrants File Class-Action Lawsuit to Stop ICE Courthouse ArrestsWhat Happened: A coalition of legal groups filed a class-action lawsuit against DHS and DOJ to stop ICE from arresting migrants at immigration court. Dozens have been detained while attending routine hearings, then fast-tracked for deportation\u2014despite pending asylum claims.Why It Matters: The courts have been turned into traps. Migrants who follow the law are being ambushed, denied due process, and swept into mass deportation pipelines. Advocates warn this is a weaponization of the judicial system to erase legal protections.Source: New York TimesFather of 3 Marines Who Was Beaten by ICE Agents Released, Leaving Family to Process His DetentionWhat Happened: Narciso Barranco, an undocumented father of three U.S. Marines, was violently arrested by ICE agents while landscaping outside a California IHOP. Video shows agents pepper-spraying and beating him. He was held for over three weeks without water for 14 hours and released only after national outcry and a $3,000 bond. DHS claims he assaulted agents with a weed-wacker, without evidence or charges filed.Why It Matters: This is what Trump\u2019s deportation crackdown looks like\u2014military families terrorized, due process ignored, and federal agents beating up the parents of American servicemembers. Even those who\u2019ve sacrificed for the country aren\u2019t safe.Source: Military.comArkansas can enforce critical race theory ban in classrooms, federal court saysWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled Arkansas can enforce its classroom ban on critical race theory, siding with Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 education overhaul. The court said students have no First Amendment right to demand specific curriculum content and lifted a prior injunction won by Little Rock Central High students.Why It Matters: This ruling sets a major precedent for GOP-led efforts to censor discussions of systemic racism in schools. While critical race theory isn't taught in K\u201312 classrooms, the bans chill broader discussions on race, history, and inequality.Source: Associated PressA refugee deported to Bhutan by the U.S. finds himself stranded and statelessWhat Happened: A man born in a Nepalese refugee camp and raised in the U.S. was deported to Bhutan\u2014a country he had never lived in. Bhutan promptly ordered him to leave. Now stateless, he's hiding in India with no legal status or support.Why It Matters: This case exposes the cruelty and chaos of Trump\u2019s deportation machine. U.S. officials are forcibly sending people to nations that reject them, violating basic human rights and endangering lives. Source: NPRMAGA Republican Says He Doesn\u2019t Care If ICE Detains U.S. CitizensWhat Happened: Rep. Ralph Norman said he doesn't care if U.S. citizens are mistakenly detained by ICE, brushing off growing reports of American citizens\u2014like disabled veteran George Retes\u2014being swept up in raids. Fellow Republicans Troy Nehls and Tommy Tuberville also dismissed concerns, with Tuberville blaming citizens for \u201changing around illegals.\u201dWhy It Matters: When elected officials condone the unlawful detention of their own constituents, it stops being about immigration and becomes a raw display of unchecked power. Constitutional rights are being treated as optional.Source: The New Republic\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchWhite House Says Fentanyl Program Will Be Funded 'In Increments'What Happened: After NPR revealed Trump officials were withholding $140 million for overdose prevention, the White House now says the money will be disbursed in \u201cincrements.\u201d CDC insiders warn the delay could force mass layoffs and shut down public health programs as the Sept. 1 funding deadline approaches.Why It Matters: Public health departments can't plan, and the uncertainty is unraveling vital addiction care just as overdose deaths had begun to decline. Trump\u2019s promises ring hollow after clawing back COVID funds and gutting the CDC's trust.Source: NPRUS CFTC begins staff firings, agency source saysWhat Happened: The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has begun purging staff across key divisions, affecting at least two dozen employees. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that opened the door to mass federal workforce purges.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s plan to gut independent oversight is accelerating. With agencies like the CFTC now purging staff, the regime is clearing out watchdogs who could challenge deregulation, corruption, or market abuse.Source: ReutersCongress targeted Planned Parenthood for defunding, but also caught a Maine health care providerWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Medicaid defunding law targeting Planned Parenthood is also cutting off funds to Maine Family Planning, a key provider in one of the nation\u2019s poorest states. The law affects all clinics focused on family planning, halting reimbursements for cancer screenings, STI treatment, and routine care. Maine Family Planning is suing to restore funding.Why It Matters: This is a backdoor attack on reproductive and rural health care. In trying to punish Planned Parenthood, Trump is gutting essential services for vulnerable communities, and patients are already being turned away.Source: Associated PressRFK Jr. and Trump Officials Embrace Psychedelics After FDA SetbackWhat Happened: RFK Jr. is fast-tracking psychedelic drug approvals, with clinical use expected within a year. Trump\u2019s FDA chief reversed Biden-era decisions, making MDMA and other psychedelics a \u201ctop priority\u201d while cutting safety review timelines. Texas, with Rick Perry\u2019s backing, is spending $50 million to study ibogaine, a controversial hallucinogen.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s team is pushing mind-altering drugs with minimal oversight, prioritizing politics over science. Experts warn that bypassing clinical trials could harm patients and undermine legitimate medical research.Source: Associated PressSources describe disarray at State Department after Trump administration's layoffsWhat Happened: Rubio purged over 1,300 State Department staffers, dismantling key offices like refugee admissions, casualty assistance, and intelligence analysis. Some employees were fired mid-mission, with no clear communication to managers.Why It Matters: The abrupt, disorganized purge has crippled vital diplomatic functions and threatens U.S. national security. It's part of a broader effort to gut oversight and human rights work in favor of Trump\u2019s extremist \"America First\" agenda.Source: CBS NewsRFK Jr. fires two top staffers in leadership shakeupWhat Happened: RFK Jr. abruptly fired his chief of staff and top policy deputy, replacing them with White House loyalist Matt Buckham. No reason was given, but sources say Kennedy lost confidence in their leadership.Why It Matters: The ouster signals deeper political consolidation at HHS. Buckham\u2019s appointment tightens White House control over public health policy amid ongoing science purges.Source: The HillTrump officials halt \u2018dangerous\u2019 research, overriding NIH career scientistsWhat Happened: Trump officials paused 40 federally funded experiments\u2014some involving tuberculosis\u2014after political appointee Matthew Memoli overruled NIH scientists, labeling the studies as \"dangerous gain-of-function\" despite prior approval. Why It Matters: Safe, decades-old medical research may now be frozen not for risk, but ideology\u2014threatening future treatments and continuing to cede scientific leadership to global rivals.Source: Washington PostRural PBS Stations Could Bear Brunt of Public Media CutsWhat Happened: Congress is considering cutting $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, targeting already-approved funding. Trump\u2019s May 1 executive order demands defunding NPR and PBS, claiming media bias. Rural stations like Smoky Hills PBS in Kansas, where federal money covers half the budget, face collapse.Why It Matters: For isolated communities, PBS is a lifeline. Cuts would gut Sesame Street, weather alerts, emergency broadcasts, and vital programming for seniors and caregivers.Source: USA TodayTension over antitrust division crops up inside Trump administration, sources sayWhat Happened: Tensions are flaring inside the Trump regime over DOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater, who\u2019s taken on companies like Google and Capital One while resisting MAGA-aligned lobbyists. Officials are now weighing her removal after she blocked backchannel influence and pushed back on political interference.Why It Matters: Slater\u2019s independence has made her a target in a regime determined to rig the system. With Trump loyalists trying to hijack antitrust enforcement, the real fight is over whether justice can survive in a government where loyalty trumps law.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHungary opposition figures urge Democrats to organize against autocratic takeover by TrumpWhat Happened: Hungarian opposition lawmaker Katalin Cseh urged Democrats to urgently mobilize for the 2026 midterms, warning that Trump is replicating Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s authoritarian playbook. At a Washington forum, Cseh cited Hungary\u2019s descent into autocracy\u2014marked by media control, court capture, and persecution of minorities\u2014as a cautionary tale for America. Trump, she said, is drawing from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s model.Why It Matters: I\u2019ve been documenting how Trump\u2019s actions mirror Russia\u2019s playbook\u2014one Orb\u00e1n adopted and adapted for Hungary. Now that same model is unfolding here in America: media retaliation, surveillance, capture of independent institutions, and the normalization of propaganda. The warning from Hungary couldn\u2019t be clearer\u2014this is how it starts.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia drops 500-kg bomb on shopping center in Donetsk Oblast \u2014 killing 2, injuring 28What Happened: Russia bombed a shopping center in Dobropillia, Donetsk Oblast, killing two and injuring 28. The 500-kg airstrike damaged hundreds of homes and shops. It comes days after Trump issued yet another deadline for Russia to accept a deal or face tariffs.Why It Matters: Civilians are still being slaughtered while Trump blusters with empty ultimatums. His delay tactics are enabling Russia\u2019s genocide and war crimes and costing Ukrainian lives.Source: Kyiv IndependentRussia\u2019s increasing use of chemical weapons in Ukraine \u2018unbearable,\u2019 says top EU diplomatWhat Happened: EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that Russia is escalating its use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine, with intelligence showing at least 9,000 documented cases since the full-scale invasion began. She called the intensifying attacks \u201cunbearable,\u201d accusing Moscow of trying to inflict maximum pain to force a Ukrainian surrender.Why It Matters: Russia has been carrying out mass chemical attacks since the start of its genocidal full-scale invasion, yet the world has responded with silence. It\u2019s mind-blowing how little attention this war crime receives\u2014no meaningful action to stop it, no enforcement of red lines, and zero accountability. Source: PoliticoRussia Isn\u2019t Sounding Rattled by Trump\u2019s UltimatumWhat Happened: After Trump gave Moscow 50 days to make a deal in Ukraine or face steep new sanctions, the Kremlin and Russian commentators responded with indifference. Officials mocked Trump\u2019s shifting timelines, questioned his resolve, and dismissed U.S. weapons shipments as unlikely to alter the course of Russia\u2019s genocidal war.Why It Matters: The Kremlin doesn\u2019t take Trump seriously, viewing his threats as political theater. Putin\u2019s regime believes time is on its side, and Trump keeps proving them right by offering delays.Source: New York TimesTrump Lashes Out at Supporters for Fixating on \u2018Epstein Hoax\u2019What Happened: Trump lashed out at his base for pressing him on Epstein disclosures, calling them \u201cweaklings\u201d and accusing them of falling for a Democratic \u201choax.\u201d The tirade came after the DOJ refused to release more files, breaking Trump\u2019s promise to expose the truth. MAGA lawmakers like Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene are now backing a bill to force the DOJ\u2019s hand.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s sharpest break with his base yet. He\u2019s turning on loyal supporters as they demand answers about Epstein, fueling a GOP split and deepening suspicions about what he might be hiding.Source: Wall Street JournalFire, Brimstone, and Hegseth: Idaho Christian Nationalists Establish a DC BeachheadWhat Happened: A militant Christian nationalist church from Idaho, Christ Kirk, has launched a new branch in Washington, D.C., with backing from Pete Hegseth and other Trump-aligned officials. Tied to controversial preacher Doug Wilson, the church promotes a theocratic vision rejecting democracy, LGBTQ+ rights, and secular governance.Why It Matters: Christian nationalism is being embedded in the heart of federal power. With high-level allies, this movement is fusing religious extremism with MAGA authoritarianism to reshape the American government.Source: Talking Points Memo\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsWhy Political Pressure on Central Banks Is So Toxic for InvestorsWhat Happened: Markets dipped after reports that Trump is considering firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Though Trump said it\u2019s \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d the signal was clear: investors fear interference in Fed independence, especially if it leads to inflationary rate cuts.Why It Matters: Undermining the Fed would destabilize markets globally. From Nixon\u2019s push for cheap money to Erdogan\u2019s disastrous meddling, history shows political pressure on central banks leads to inflation, currency collapse, and investor flight. Wall Street fired another warning shot.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsFederal judge says she would block Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order nationwideWhat Happened: A second federal judge, Deborah Boardman of Maryland, said she would grant a nationwide injunction against Trump\u2019s order ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented or temporary immigrants, pending appeal. One judge in New Hampshire has already issued a nationwide block via class action. Trump\u2019s order is now on a fast track to the Supreme Court.Source: Associated Press20 states sue FEMA for canceling grant program that guards against natural disastersWhat Happened: 20 Democratic-led states are suing FEMA for abruptly killing the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, a key disaster mitigation grant system. Despite being funded by Congress, Trump officials called it \u201cwasteful\u201d and halted all projects, including ones already approved. The lawsuit argues the termination was unlawful and left communities vulnerable, especially amid worsening floods and storms.Source: Associated PressFederal lawsuit seeks to stop ICE agents from arresting people at immigration courtsWhat Happened: A federal class-action lawsuit filed in D.C. aims to stop ICE from arresting immigrants at court hearings and fast-tracking their deportations. Since May, ICE agents have been detaining people in courthouse hallways, despite having no criminal records. Legal advocates say this violates due process and deters migrants from participating in legal proceedings.Source: Associated PressJudge Chastises U.S. Over Secrecy in Moving to Drop Charges Against MS-13 LeaderWhat Happened: A federal judge rebuked the Justice Department for secretly trying to dismiss charges against MS-13 leader Vladimir Ar\u00e9valo Ch\u00e1vez and deport him to El Salvador as part of a deal with President Bukele. The court unsealed the case after rejecting the DOJ\u2019s request to hide it from the public.Source: New York TimesSupreme Court justice pauses ruling weakening Voting Rights ActWhat Happened: Justice Brett Kavanaugh temporarily blocked a federal ruling that would bar individuals in seven states from suing under the Voting Rights Act for racial discrimination.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. ICE Is a Tool of Political Repression \u2014 From courthouse ambushes to DNA databanks and internment camps, Trump\u2019s ICE is no longer about law\u2014it\u2019s about power, punishment, cruelty, and fear.Health Care Sabotage Is a Feature \u2014 From rural clinics to overdose prevention, Trump\u2019s policies are systematically dismantling care for the vulnerable\u2014replacing it with chaos.Child Detention Is a Deliberate Strategy \u2014 Trump is using children as leverage in his immigration crackdown\u2014detaining toddlers, reopening family prisons, and shredding protections.Authoritarianism Thrives on Secrecy and Delay \u2014 From Epstein records to aid destruction and court gag orders, the Trump regime hides evidence, dodges scrutiny, and dares the public to keep track.Corruption Is Baked Into the System \u2014 From bribes, presidential library influence peddling to self-dealing with court appointees, Trump\u2019s regime treats government like a private racket\u2014and rewards loyalty over law.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Court With Crimes Against Humanity.</span></p><p><span>Rather than debate Trump's laughable proposal that he be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the International Criminal Court should charge him with Crimes Against Humanity</span></p><p><span>Over the past several months,  our country has been flooded with horrendous stories about how Trump's faceless goons and thugs have been using NAZI storm trooper tactics to kidnap suspected illegal immigrants and their young children and throw them into nightmare detention facilities, including one guarded by huge alligators, not to mention Trump's own animals in uniform,  for immediate deportation to horrific prisons in impoverished third-world countries where they have no prior connection.</span></p><p><span>The last straw that prompted my proposal was the following narrative reported in the Trump Tyranny Tracker Substack, citing NPR as its source:</span></p><p><span>\t\"A refugee deported to Bhutan by the U.S. finds himself stranded and stateless. What Happened: A man born in a Nepalese refugee camp and raised in the U.S. was deported to Bhutan\u2014a country he had never lived in. Bhutan promptly ordered him to leave. Now stateless, he's hiding in India with no legal status or support. Why It Matters: This case exposes the cruelty and chaos of Trump\u2019s deportation machine. U.S. officials are forcibly sending people to nations that reject them, violating basic human rights and endangering lives.\"</span></p><p><span>While the United States is not a signatory to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and does not recognize its authority, the vastly mounting evidence of cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated throughout our country by Trump's hooligans against both legal and illegal immigrants should be submitted to the Court for its review and deliberations. While any decision by the Court may have no legal effect upon Donald Trump or the United States, an indictment would send a powerful symbolic message throughout the world of Trump's cruelties and inhumane treatment of our fellow human beings.</span></p><p><span>At a minimum, an indictment for crimes against humanity would deter Sweden and the world from even considering a proposal to award the Nobel Peace Prize or any prize or praise to this monster.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div

Senators Warren and Blumenthal are pushing legislation to cap donations, ban foreign gifts, and require disclosures.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The fund is a vehicle for influence-peddling while Trump is still in office. With no rules in place, Trump is exploiting library fundraising as a backchannel for favors and policy influence. This creates a legalized bribery pipeline that shapes policy decisions and further undermines trust in government.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-presidential-library-fundraising/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Has Draft of Letter to Fire Fed Chair. He Asked Republicans if He Should Send It</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump showed House Republicans a draft letter to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asking if he should send it. Although, when asked, he claimed no immediate plans, he has repeatedly attacked Powell for not slashing interest rates and ranted about \\u201Cfraud\\u201D tied to a $2.5 billion Fed building renovation. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is once again threatening the Fed\\u2019s independence to gain political control over monetary policy.

After the IRS counsel refused to release records on 7.3 million people, he was ousted. A leaked blueprint shows plans for an automated system that bypasses privacy safeguards and funnels bulk data to DHS.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shatters the firewall between tax privacy and law enforcement.  Data that is supposed to be safe and protected is now a tool for mass targeting. As I keep saying, immigrants are a test case for a broader surveillance dragnet that will sweep up anyone. This is how authoritarian systems take root.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-share-tax-records-ice-dhs-deportations\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>DOJ hits states with broad requests for voter rolls, election data</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The DOJ is demanding voter rolls and pressing states to allow inspections of voting machines, sparking alarm across party lines. In Colorado, clerks say a Trump-connected operative linked to Stephen Miller is contacting counties about federal access to machines\\u2014something election law forbids. Separately, the DOJ has quietly asked at least 9 states for full voter files, part of Trump\\u2019s broader effort to centralize election control.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is the 2020 coup playbook\\u2014on steroids. After years of threats, lawsuits, and lies, Trump\\u2019s team is using federal power to lay the groundwork for election interference in 2026. This is a power grab disguised as oversight, threatening to purge voters, intimidate clerks, and dismantle trust in U.S. elections. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/16/trump-voter-fraud-elections/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Justice Department Fires Ghislaine Maxwell Prosecutor Maurene Comey</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The DOJ abruptly fired Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and lead prosecutor in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Comey also handled parts of the Epstein and Sean \\u201CDiddy\\u201D Combs cases. No reason was given, but it follows Trump\\u2019s attacks on DOJ officials and growing MAGA anger over withheld Epstein files.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is political revenge and red meat for Trump\\u2019s base. By firing Maurene Comey, Trump is targeting prosecutors tied to Epstein while deflecting from demands to release the files. It\\u2019s both a purge of independent law enforcement and a calculated distraction to rile up supporters and shield elites.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/justice-department-fires-ghislaine-maxwell-prosecutor-maurene-comey-1edc5091?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhy3eKroOV7-nyyY3LAw7RVZ91k0L1HJJ7dQssz3DQbi20OOi1MEcVP68Sclx0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=687839ea&amp;gaa_sig=00DdQgq2xE8lKI18TfDQuQwYZbPqTRsMDjcN18xfxfZRylCOLQil2szOSWsJqCVBCz6KbmSHnrQE3x8BkSTV7A%3D%3D\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>US considered charging Minnesota judges, lawyers in immigration crackdown, sources say</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department considered prosecuting Minnesota judges and defense lawyers for requesting virtual court hearings to prevent ICE arrests. Internal emails and legal discussions sparked an FBI probe, though no charges have been filed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unprecedented move reveals how Trump\\u2019s DOJ continues targeting the legal system\\u2014seeking to intimidate judges and defense attorneys for doing their jobs and protecting due process. It would be another dangerous escalation in criminalizing resistance to Trump\\u2019s extremist agenda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-considered-charging-minnesota-judges-lawyers-immigration-crackdown-sources-2025-07-16/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Democratic senators raise concerns about a new Trump citizenship data system</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> 3 Democratic senators are sounding the alarm over Trump\\u2019s new national citizenship verification system, warning it could wrongly flag eligible citizens and suppress votes. The DHS tool links immigration and Social Security data and is being quietly offered to state election officials without public transparency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s team is building a centralized database with no oversight\\u2014while briefing far-right election denial groups and bypassing Congress. Civil liberties advocates fear it will be weaponized to target naturalized citizens and people of color.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5469815/democrats-citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>900 Ex-Justice Dept.

Confirming him would reward obedience over impartial justice\\u2014and further erode the line between law and authoritarian enforcement.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/us/politics/justice-dept-lawyers-emil-bove-federal-judge.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Spurned U.S. Attorney Clings to Job by Being Appointed His Own Assistant</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> After a panel of federal judges refused to make John Sarcone the permanent U.S. attorney in Albany, the DOJ quietly reappointed him as \\u201Cspecial attorney to the attorney general,\\u201D granting him indefinite authority over the office. The move bypasses Senate confirmation and defies judicial rejection.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The DOJ is warping legal norms to keep subservients in power\\u2014no matter their qualifications, conduct, or public rejection.

Senator Ron Wyden is demanding answers, calling it a \\u201Cchilling expansion\\u201D of surveillance powers. At least 227 children were age 13 or younger, with 70% from Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Migrant kids are now tagged for life in a law enforcement system built for rapists and murderers.

Despite identifying himself and showing proof of employment, DHS agents allegedly ignored him. DHS confirmed his arrest and said federal charges are under review.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is what authoritarian policing looks like.

ICE has reopened family detention centers like Dilley, Texas, and is targeting children during traffic stops, raids, and at school. Many face deportation proceedings alone in court.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is deliberate cruelty.

The aid, which could have saved lives in Gaza or other crisis zones, went unused after Trump\\u2019s dismantling of USAID gutted its oversight and planning capacity.

Opened hastily on July 3 for Trump\\u2019s mass deportation drive, the swamp-surrounded camp holds hundreds in tents plagued by bugs, flooding, and poor medical care.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is state-run internment under the guise of immigration enforcement.

Dozens have been detained while attending routine hearings, then fast-tracked for deportation\\u2014despite pending asylum claims.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The courts have been turned into traps.

The court said students have no First Amendment right to demand specific curriculum content and lifted a prior injunction won by Little Rock Central High students.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This ruling sets a major precedent for GOP-led efforts to censor discussions of systemic racism in schools.

Bhutan promptly ordered him to leave. Now stateless, he's hiding in India with no legal status or support.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This case exposes the cruelty and chaos of Trump\\u2019s deportation machine.

Fellow Republicans Troy Nehls and Tommy Tuberville also dismissed concerns, with Tuberville blaming citizens for \\u201Changing around illegals.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> When elected officials condone the unlawful detention of their own constituents, it stops being about immigration and becomes a raw display of unchecked power.

The law affects all clinics focused on family planning, halting reimbursements for cancer screenings, STI treatment, and routine care.
