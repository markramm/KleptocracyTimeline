We\u2019ll explore the latest geopolitical shifts, Russia\u2019s growing influence, and what it means for the U.S. and Europe going forward.This is an open AMA format\u2014come with your questions, insights, or just listen in on an urgent conversation.This event is open to all paid subscribers\u2014whether you\u2019re with me or with Julie Roginsky, Salty Politics, you\u2019re invited to join us.

The May 22 event at Trump\u2019s Virginia golf club offers access to a president for sale, a dinner, and a White House tour.Why It Matters: The $TRUMP coin has generated over $324 million for Trump-linked entities, turning the dinner into a corrupt presidential pay-for-access scheme. This violates the Foreign Emoluments Clause and opens the door to untraceable foreign influence\u2014all while embracing extremism and antisemitism through crypto.Source: CREWA Crypto Billionaire Who Feared Arrest in the U.S. Returns for Dinner With TrumpWhat Happened: Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin Sun\u2014under U.S. investigation for fraud and linked to illicit crypto flows\u2014returned to the U.S. to attend a VIP dinner with Trump. Sun, who previously avoided the U.S. for fear of arrest, is now Trump\u2019s biggest $TRUMP memecoin backer and invested $75 million in his World Liberty Financial venture. Of course, the SEC quietly \u201cpaused\u201d its case against him earlier this year.Why It Matters: A fugitive crypto billionaire bought face time with the Trump and poured millions into Trump\u2019s business. The dropped fraud case and Sun\u2019s red-carpet return reiterate that Trump\u2019s White House is open for sale. More blatant corruption and a national security threat.Source: Wall Street JournalTop $TRUMP holders head to crypto dinner with president that Democrats call \u2018orgy of corruption\u2019What Happened: Trump held an exclusive black-tie dinner at his Virginia golf club on Thursday for the top 220 holders of his $TRUMP meme coin\u2014many of them foreign investors. The top 25 buyers were granted private access to Trump. One attendee reportedly spent $500,000 for a seat, and some guests arrived wearing masks to conceal their identities.Why It Matters: This $148 million crypto scheme is a blatant pay-to-play scheme. While Trump\u2019s allies raked in millions, small investors lost nearly $4 billion. Ethics watchdogs say the event monetized the presidency, opened the door to foreign influence, and showcased Trump\u2019s ongoing abuse of power for personal profit.Source: CNBCThe Father Pursues Trump\u2019s Diplomatic Deals. The Son Chases Crypto Deals.What Happened: Trump\u2019s envoy and real estate developer, Steve Witkoff, and his son Zach are blurring the line between diplomacy and private profit. As Steve negotiates with foreign governments, his sons pitch them a dollar-backed crypto token (USD1) via their firm, World Liberty Financial\u2014raising conflict-of-interest concerns amid ongoing U.S. trade and diplomatic talks.Why It Matters: It\u2019s classic influence-peddling\u2014foreign policy and personal profit wrapped into one. This invites foreign bribery, undermines national security, and uses crypto to quietly sell access under the guise of diplomacy.Source: Wall Street JournalThe Largest Upward Transfer of Wealth in American HistoryWhat Happened: House Republicans narrowly passed a bill that slashes food aid and Medicaid for low-income Americans, while handing huge tax cuts to the wealthy. The measure includes new work requirements aimed at cutting millions off critical programs\u2014and it was pushed through without full CBO review.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s GOP is gutting support for working families to fund a massive wealth transfer to CEOs and billionaires. It\u2019s an aggressive, ideological attack on the social safety net\u2014and a warning of what\u2019s to come.Source: The AtlanticSmall Business Buys $2M in Trump Coin to Get President\u2019s AttentionWhat Happened: Freight Technologies, a California logistics company hurt by Trump\u2019s new tariffs, spent $2 million on Trump\u2019s $TRUMP meme coin to try to gain access to an exclusive dinner with Trump. While they didn\u2019t make the top tier of token holders invited, executives said the gamble was worth it to boost visibility.Why It Matters: It\u2019s a direct channel for influence-peddling aimed at shaping U.S.-Mexico trade policy, with this company using crypto to buy time with Trump.Source: CBS NewsFrom the Day 106 tracker\u2026A Tiny Company Wants to Buy $20M TRUMP Token to Change U.S.-Mexico Trade DealsWhat Happened: Freight Technologies, a struggling $4.8M logistics firm, announced plans to buy up to $20 million in a Trump token, claiming the move will promote \u201cfair trade\u201d with Mexico. The firm\u2019s CEO openly tied the investment to influencing U.S. trade policy under Trump, who has promised private dinners to top token holders.Why It Matters: More pay-to-play schemes. Trump has turned crypto into a tool for corporate influence and political access. Companies and countries are buying memecoins to sway U.S. policy and curry favor with Trump.Source: CoindeskMore Than a Dozen U.S. Officials Sold Stocks Before Trump\u2019s Tariffs Sent the Market PlungingWhat Happened: A ProPublica investigation revealed that over a dozen White House and federal officials sold stocks just before Trump\u2019s April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs triggered a market dive. Officials at the State Department, USTR, and other agencies made well-timed trades days ahead of the announcement, highlighting the corruption.Why It Matters: The trades reek of insider advantage. It undermines public trust and signals a rigged system where officials profit off chaos they help create. Calls are growing to tighten the rules and restore accountability.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsRepublican Bill Would Limit Judges\u2019 Contempt PowerWhat Happened: House Republicans passed a sweeping bill that would limit federal judges\u2019 power to hold officials in contempt\u2014especially in cases where plaintiffs were not required to post bond for injunctions. The bill arrives as multiple Trump officials face contempt threats for defying deportation-related court orders.Why It Matters: The measure would shield Trump allies from legal consequences, undermine judicial authority, and retroactively interfere with active court cases. It\u2019s another dangerous step toward dismantling checks on executive overreach.Source: New York TimesJD Vance Blasts Chief Justice Roberts Over Court\u2019s RoleWhat Happened: JD Vance attacked Chief Justice John Roberts for saying courts should check executive power, calling it \u201cprofoundly wrong.\u201d Vance accused the judiciary of blocking Trump\u2019s immigration agenda and overriding the will of voters.Why It Matters: The comments reiterate a disregard for the separation of powers and judicial independence. As Trump escalates attacks on courts that block his agenda\u2014and repeatedly ignores court orders\u2014it signals growing contempt for constitutional checks and a dangerous erosion of the rule of law.Source: USA TodaySupreme Court Allows Trump to Remove Independent Regulators \u2014 For NowWhat Happened: The Supreme Court allowed Trump to continue firing independent regulators without cause while a key legal challenge is ongoing. The unsigned order denied reinstatement of two Biden-era officials\u2014Gwynne Wilcox (NLRB) and Cathy A. Harris (MSPB)\u2014signaling support for expanded presidential control over executive agencies.Why It Matters: The decision would overturn nearly a century of precedent limiting presidential power over independent watchdogs. If Trump prevails, he will purge regulators across the federal government\u2014undermining civil service protections, eliminating oversight, and consolidating control.Source: Washington PostDOGE Used Meta\u2019s AI to Review Resignation Emails from Federal WorkersWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s operatives deployed Meta\u2019s Llama 2 AI model through the Office of Personnel Management to analyze federal employee responses to a mass email offering resignation for those unwilling to comply with Trump-era workforce changes. The surveillance was conducted locally, without internet-based data sharing.Why It Matters: This is the first confirmed case of Meta\u2019s AI being used for internal surveillance of federal workers. Critics warn it\u2019s part of Musk\u2019s growing arsenal\u2014tools like AutoRIF for mass firings and CamoGPT to erase DEI language\u2014fueling Musk\u2019s vision of an AI-powered, loyalty-screened federal government.Source: WIRED\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Blocks Harvard from Enrolling Foreign StudentsWhat Happened: Trump officials revoked Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll international students, citing alleged antisemitism and \u201cties\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party. Kristi Noem ordered the move, affecting nearly 7,000 students and demanding Harvard hand over protest records within 72 hours.Why It Matters: The crackdown threatens core academic freedoms and a major revenue stream for U.S. universities. Harvard called the move illegal and retaliatory, vowing to support its international students. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader attack on higher education as he seeks to politicize and control academic institutions.Source: ReutersPentagon Approves 1,100 More Troops for Southern Border What Happened: The Pentagon has approved the deployment of 1,115 additional active-duty troops to the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, bringing the total close to 10,000.Why It Matters: Trump is effectively normalizing the militarization of the border, designating areas as Defense Department land to let troops detain migrants\u2014dodging legal limits on military policing. Judges have already thrown out related charges, and this is a dangerous workaround that undermines both the law and military readiness. With troop levels rising, this tactic is poised to expand beyond immigration and into broader domestic enforcement.Source: Military TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump White House Purges Official Transcripts of President\u2019s RemarksWhat Happened: Trump officials have removed nearly all official transcripts of the president\u2019s public remarks from WhiteHouse.gov, replacing them with select videos. As of now, only Trump\u2019s 2025 inaugural address remains online. A White House official claimed the move was made to \"maintain consistency\" and to offer what they called a more \u201caccurate sense\u201d of Trump via video. Why It Matters: Trump is erasing the written record of his presidency\u2014scrubbing transcripts so his words can\u2019t be easily searched, quoted, or held against him. It\u2019s a calculated move to control the narrative, dodge accountability, and rewrite history on his terms. Transparency is gone, and this is how authoritarian regimes operate.Source: NBC NewsFTC Targets Media Matters in Musk-Ad Collusion ProbeWhat Happened: The FTC is investigating Media Matters over alleged \u201ccoordination with advertisers\u201d to harm Elon Musk\u2019s X platform. The probe follows Musk\u2019s lawsuit accusing the liberal watchdog of orchestrating a boycott.Why It Matters: This is blatant political retaliation and a dangerous overreach of federal power\u2014part of Trump\u2019s broader plan to weaponize the government against his enemies. By targeting ActBlue, Democratic law firms, and others, the regime is using sham investigations to intimidate, punish, and silence dissent. This is just the beginning.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Proposal Would Use Foreign Aid to Deport Ukrainians, HaitiansWhat Happened: Trump plans to divert $250 million in U.S. foreign aid to fund the voluntary deportation of up to 700,000 migrants, including Ukrainians, Haitians, Afghans, Syrians, and Sudanese. Internal documents show the plan bypasses the U.N. and targets those granted protected status under past administrations.Why It Matters: The plan is inhumane\u2014forcing refugees back into war zones and gang-controlled states. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to eliminate foreign aid, sideline international norms, and undermine refugee protections enshrined in U.S. and international law.Source: Washington PostThe Gang-Linked Prison Chief Taking Custody of Trump\u2019s DeporteesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s deportation plan has disappeared immigrants without due process to El Salvador\u2019s prison system run by Osiris Luna, sanctioned by the U.S. for secret deals with MS-13.Why It Matters: As Trump rants about MS-13, he\u2019s collaborating with a foreign official sanctioned for secret deals with that gang\u2014while disappearing people from U.S. soil without due process. The hypocrisy is staggering.Source: Wall Street JournalICE Agents Arrest Migrants After Court Hearings in New Trump TacticWhat Happened: ICE is detaining undocumented immigrants outside immigration courts\u2014during mandatory appearances. The tactic targets individuals admitted under Biden-era parole programs and has been reported in cities including Phoenix, New York, Miami, and Seattle.Why It Matters: Migrants who follow legal channels are being ambushed and detained. It\u2019s a direct assault on due process and an escalation of Trump\u2019s war on immigrants.Source: USA TodayTrump Is Trying to Scrap Basic Protections for Unaccompanied Immigrant ChildrenWhat Happened: Trump is trying again to terminate the Flores Settlement, which sets basic standards for housing unaccompanied migrant kids, like soap, clean water, and safe facilities.Why It Matters: Ending Flores would let the government detain children indefinitely in jail-like conditions. It\u2019s a sickening attack on the bare minimum protections for vulnerable kids.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s Tax Bill to Cost 830,000 Jobs, Raise Energy Bills, and Spike Emissions, Experts WarnWhat Happened: The House passed Trump\u2019s tax bill that slashes clean energy incentives from Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, ending EV credits in 2025, phasing out wind, solar, and nuclear tax breaks by 2032, and eliminating home efficiency subsidies after this year.Why It Matters: Experts warn the bill will slash 830,000 clean energy jobs by 2030, raise household energy bills by $230 a year, and spike U.S. emissions by 260 million tonnes by 2035. It jeopardizes $522 billion in investment, reversing climate gains and punishing workers across the board.Source: The GuardianMillions Could Lose Food Stamp Benefits Under Republican Bill, Analysis FindsWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than 3 million Americans could lose SNAP benefits monthly under House Republicans\u2019 new tax bill, which imposes stricter work requirements and shifts some program costs to states.Why It Matters: The bill\u2019s proposed $300 billion in anti-poverty cuts would hit low-income families hardest, reducing food aid eligibility, slashing benefits, and potentially pushing states to exit the program. Source: New York TimesRepublicans Pass Strictest Medicaid Work Requirement YetWhat Happened: The House passed a GOP bill that would impose the harshest Medicaid work requirements ever, forcing childless adults to prove 80 hours of work or volunteering each month to qualify. Millions risk losing coverage\u2014even if they\u2019re already working.Why It Matters: The CBO says 7.6 million people could be kicked off Medicaid, with $280 billion in \u201csavings\u201d redirected to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the rich. It\u2019s a cruel backdoor cut to healthcare access, targeting vulnerable Americans. The bill now heads to the Senate.Source: New York TimesFunding Cuts Are a \u2018Gut Punch\u2019 for STEM Education ResearchersWhat Happened: Since April, the National Science Foundation has canceled over 1,400 grants, with STEM education projects making up 54%\u2014a $773 million loss. Many of these grants focused on helping underserved students, such as Indigenous youth and rural Black students, enter science and engineering fields.Why It Matters: The cuts gut diversity and STEM programs on purpose. It\u2019s a politically driven attack on equity in science\u2014one that sabotages future innovation, weakens the workforce, and turns research into an ideological battleground.Source: New York TimesTrump Has Cut Science Funding to Its Lowest Level in DecadesWhat Happened: The National Science Foundation is awarding new grants at the slowest rate in 35+ years. Grant funding is down 51% this year, and over 1,600 active research awards worth $1.5 billion have been canceled. Fields like climate science, physics, engineering, and STEM education are among the hardest hit.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on America\u2019s scientific future. The cuts threaten U.S. innovation, economic growth, and global competitiveness\u2014crippling the next generation of researchers while targeting diversity and climate programs for an extremist agenda.Source: New York TimesWeather Service Enters Hurricane Season With Cuts to Staff, Office Hours and DataWhat Happened: As hurricane season begins, the National Weather Service is facing major staffing cuts\u2014600 jobs purged, six offices closed overnight, and a drastic reduction in weather balloon launches. Offices in high-risk regions like Houston and Nashville report vacancy rates nearing 50%, and NOAA is asking staff to cover critical roles without added pay.Why It Matters: With up to 19 named storms forecasted, degraded forecasting threatens lives. Experts warn that weakened tracking and slower warnings will leave communities vulnerable\u2014just as climate-fueled disasters are accelerating.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump's image of dead 'White farmers' from Reuters footage in Congo, not South AfricaWhat Happened: During an Oval Office ambush, Trump presented South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with a blog post falsely claiming to show \u201cwhite farmers being buried\u201d in South Africa. The image was in fact a still from verified Reuters footage of an M23 rebel attack in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo.Why It Matters: Trump invoked a fake genocide and used African war footage from Congo to promote the debunked \u201cwhite genocide\u201d conspiracy\u2014amplifying a white nationalist agenda under the guise of diplomacy. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s larger agenda: empowering extremists, spreading disinformation, and aligning U.S. foreign policy with white supremacist movements.Source: USA TodayU.S. Considers Withdrawing Thousands of Troops From South KoreaWhat Happened: Trump officials are considering withdrawing 4,500 U.S. troops from South Korea and repositioning them elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, such as Guam. The plan is part of a broader policy review on North Korea but hasn\u2019t yet been finalized.Why It Matters: Pulling troops from South Korea would upend decades of deterrence strategy and would destabilize the region. It would embolden North Korea and China while rattling key allies like Japan\u2014handing adversaries another strategic win.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Demands Zelensky\u2019s Removal to Sign War MemorandumWhat Happened: A senior Russian diplomat declared Zelenskyy must be replaced before any \u201cpeace deal\u201d is signed, calling him illegitimate. This came days after Putin\u2019s call with Trump, who then urged Zelenskyy to negotiate with Moscow and dropped talk of sanctions.Why It Matters: Russia is again trying to pick Ukraine\u2019s president\u2014and Trump is helping by providing the Russians cover. By backing off sanctions and continuing to push Kyiv to surrender, Trump is empowering Putin. It\u2019s another assault on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.Source: TASSG7 Finance Chiefs Threaten More Sanctions on RussiaWhat Happened: G7 finance ministers warned they may increase sanctions if Russia refuses a ceasefire in Ukraine, but used softer language than before Trump\u2019s reelection. Trump has reduced U.S. support for Kyiv and blamed Ukraine for Russia\u2019s full-scale genocidal invasion.Why It Matters: G7 unity is cracking as Trump cozies up to Putin. Germany is deploying 5,000 troops to Lithuania to deter Russian aggression, while Europe braces for a future without the U.S. The fractures are deepening\u2014and Russia is watching.Source: The GuardianTrump Tells European Leaders Putin Thinks He\u2019s Winning the WarWhat Happened: During a call with European leaders, Trump said Putin \u201cdoes not want peace\u201d and believes he\u2019s winning the war in Ukraine. Trump dismissed the idea of pushing for an unconditional ceasefire, suggesting the war is \u201cEurope\u2019s problem.\u201d He also walked back a previous indication that sanctions were on the table if Russia refused to negotiate.Why It Matters: Trump is doing Putin\u2019s bidding\u2014again, as Russia continues its genocidal war. Europe is now preparing to defend Ukraine without the U.S. because Trump is aligned with the KremlinSource: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsBond Market Shudders as Trump\u2019s Tax Bill Fuels Debt FearsWhat Happened: Financial markets reacted sharply after the House passed Trump\u2019s tax bill, which extends and adds tax cuts and is projected to increase the deficit by over $3 trillion. U.S. Treasury yields spiked, with the 30-year yield reaching 5.15%, as investors demand higher returns amid rising concerns over America\u2019s fiscal health.Why It Matters: The surge in borrowing costs threatens to ripple across mortgages, loans, and business credit. Moody\u2019s recently downgraded U.S. debt, and the Federal Reserve warned of growing investor skepticism. Analysts say Trump\u2019s policies are eroding confidence in U.S. assets and may delay Fed rate cuts, deepening economic risks.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite on June 6th in D.C.Judge Says Trump Cannot Downsize Federal Agencies Without CongressWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that Trump cannot carry out mass purges across federal agencies without congressional approval.

The image was in fact a still from verified Reuters footage of an M23 rebel attack in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump invoked a fake genocide and used African war footage from Congo to promote the debunked \\u201Cwhite genocide\\u201D conspiracy\\u2014amplifying a white nationalist agenda under the guise of diplomacy.
