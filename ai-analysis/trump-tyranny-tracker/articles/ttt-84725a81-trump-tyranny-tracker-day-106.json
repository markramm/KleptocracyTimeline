Credit...Sophie Park/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 5Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udea8 AnnouncementStarting this week, Zev Shalev and I are taking the Trump Tyranny Tracker to Substack LIVE \u2014 every Monday through Thursday at 2 PM ET.We\u2019ll break down the top stories the media isn\u2019t paying attention to \u2014 power grabs, agency purges, surveillance overreach, and the tactics being used to dismantle democracy. Please tune in and spread the word!\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Sons\u2019 Deals on Three Continents Directly Benefit the PresidentWhat Happened: Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have launched a global spree of lucrative real estate, crypto, and membership club ventures\u2014spanning the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Washington, D.C.\u2014that directly funnel money back to Trump. These deals include a $1 billion Dubai tower, crypto partnerships tied to foreign governments, and a $500,000-per-member private club in D.C. Many of the ventures are coordinated with foreign officials, often in countries where Trump has substantial diplomatic influence.Why It Matters: This is kleptocracy in action. Trump is openly profiting from the presidency through his sons\u2019 deals while dismantling oversight and gutting regulatory enforcement. Foreign governments and business elites are paying Trump\u2019s family for access and protection\u2014undermining U.S. ethics rules and endangering national security.Source: New York TimesWhat We Know About Trump\u2019s $1.5 Million-a-Head Fund-Raising DinnerWhat Happened: Trump headlined a $1.5 million-per-person \u201ccrypto and AI\u201d dinner at his Virginia golf club to raise funds for MAGA Inc., his super PAC that backs loyalist candidates and threatens GOP dissenters. The event featured top crypto allies like David Sacks and was closed to the press.Why It Matters: Trump is selling influence to the highest bidders\u2014using AI and crypto hype to bankroll his movement, reward loyalists, and shape the GOP into a pay-to-play machine. This is what naked corruption looks like.Source: New York TimesA Tiny Company Wants to Buy $20M TRUMP Token to Change U.S.-Mexico Trade DealsWhat Happened: Freight Technologies, a struggling $4.8M logistics firm, announced plans to buy up to $20 million in a Trump token, claiming the move will promote \u201cfair trade\u201d with Mexico. The firm\u2019s CEO openly tied the investment to influencing U.S. trade policy under Trump, who has promised private dinners to top token holders.Why It Matters: More pay-to-play schemes. Trump has turned crypto into a tool for corporate influence and political access. Companies and countries are buying memecoins to sway U.S. policy and curry favor with Trump.Source: CoinDeskTrump\u2019s Meme Coin Business Racks Up Fees as Buyers Jump for Access to TrumpWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s meme coin has generated over $320 million in fees, with the top holders offered exclusive access to a May 22 dinner and reception with Trump.Why It Matters: The scheme exposes how Trump is blatantly merging the presidency with personal profit\u2014using shady cryptocurrency to sell access to himself and funnel cash into his family business, with zero concern for ethics or accountability.Source: ABC NewsReport Spotlights Lobbying by White House Chief\u2019s Former ClientsWhat Happened: A new report from watchdog group Public Citizen reveals that several former lobbying clients of Trump Chief of Staff Susie Wiles have met with White House staff. Though Wiles denies participating in those meetings (except one call with General Motors), concerns have been raised over ethics and transparency.Why It Matters: With Trump having revoked prior executive orders requiring appointees to recuse from decisions affecting recent clients, Wiles faces no formal restriction, highlighting conflicts of interest and influence peddling inside the White House.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsFor Trump, the Constitution Is a Hindrance as He Pushes for DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump openly questioned whether he\u2019s bound by the Constitution, casting doubt on due process rights while pushing mass deportations. His regime is invoking fringe and unlawful legal theories like the Alien Enemies Act, defying Supreme Court rulings, and demanding the impeachment of judges who block his policies\u2014all to bulldoze the courts and subvert the rule of law.Why It Matters: This is a textbook authoritarian move\u2014manufacturing a national \u201cemergency\u201d to override constitutional rights and undermine judicial independence. Trump is not just targeting immigrants\u2014he\u2019s testing how far he can go in dismantling the rule of law.Source: New York TimesHegseth Orders 20 Percent Cut in Four-Star OfficersWhat Happened: Hegseth has gutted top military leadership, firing many women and people of color, and now has ordered a 20% cut in four-star officers. Why It Matters: This is a political purge of the military. Hegseth is eliminating experienced leadership under the pretext of fighting \u201cwokeness,\u201d undermining the chain of command, degrading readiness, and laying the groundwork for authoritarian control\u2014where illegal orders could be issued and followed without question.Source: New York TimesTrump Wades Into Confirmation Fight Over Controversial Pick for Top DC ProsecutorWhat Happened: Trump is personally lobbying GOP senators to confirm Ed Martin as U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., despite Martin\u2019s praise of a Nazi-linked January 6 insurrectionist, repeated nondisclosures, inflammatory media appearances\u2014and over 200 appearances on Russian state media parroting Kremlin propaganda. Why It Matters: As interim U.S. Attorney, Martin has weaponized the office to serve Trump\u2019s political agenda\u2014purging January 6 prosecutors, referring to DOJ staff as \u201cTrump\u2019s lawyers,\u201d and targeting perceived enemies. Confirming him would hand Trump full control over the most politically sensitive federal jurisdiction in the country.Source: CNN\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Directs DOJ to Intervene in Tina Peters Case, Calling Her a 'Political Prisoner'What Happened: Trump publicly ordered the Department of Justice to intervene in the case of convicted ex-Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, calling her imprisonment \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d and demanding her release, despite her conviction on multiple felony charges for tampering with election systems.Why It Matters: Trump is using presidential power to interfere in a state-level prosecution, escalating the politicization of the justice system to shield allies who spread election lies and tampered with election systems. This sets a dangerous precedent, undermining the rule of law and accelerating the collapse of judicial independence.Source: Colorado Public RadioStates Are Tightening Rules for Getting Citizen-Led Proposals on the BallotWhat Happened: After a wave of successful abortion rights ballot measures, GOP-led states like Florida and Arkansas are imposing harsh new restrictions on the citizen initiative process\u2014limiting signature collection, shortening deadlines, and threatening criminal penalties for unregistered petitioners. Why It Matters: Republican lawmakers are rigging the rules to block citizens from bypassing them on abortion, health care, and voting rights. When voters win at the ballot box, they rewrite the rules. Source: New York Times Trump Official Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research GrantsWhat Happened: Trump announced that Harvard is banned from receiving new federal research grants, citing \u201cdisastrous mismanagement,\u201d lack of conservative faculty, and resistance to government oversight. Why It Matters: More political retaliation. Trump is using federal funding as a weapon to punish elite institutions that defy him and to impose ideological conformity. It\u2019s an authoritarian assault on academic freedom and the independence of scientific research.Source: New York TimesTrump Threatens Schools With Student-Loan RestrictionsWhat Happened: Trump officials warned colleges that schools with high student-loan default rates could lose access to federal student aid.Why It Matters: This punitive move will devastate schools and students, weaponizing loan defaults to force colleges into political compliance, while accelerating aggressive collections that can lead to wage garnishment, seized tax refunds, and even Social Security checks.Source: Wall Street JournalSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFormer Official Targeted by Trump Says the President Is Trying to Silence CriticsWhat Happened: Miles Taylor, the former DHS official who anonymously warned of Trump\u2019s behavior in office, says he\u2019s now the subject of federal scrutiny after Trump accused him of \u201ctreason\u201d and ordered a review of his actions. Taylor believes the probe is politically motivated and designed to punish dissent.Why It Matters: Taylor\u2019s case is just the beginning of Trump\u2019s retribution. Trump is weaponizing executive power to punish critics and silence dissent, using the government against former officials who spoke out\u2014an authoritarian tactic that threatens free speech and the rule of law.Source: NBC NewsTrump Proposes Terms for Federal Oversight of Columbia UniversityWhat Happened: Trump offered Columbia University a consent decree that would place the school under judicial oversight, demanding it end \"race-based admissions and enforce \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d among faculty, as a condition for reinstating $400 million in revoked federal funding.Why It Matters: This is a direct attempt to force ideological conformity at elite universities\u2014using federal power to impose MAGA political goals and strip schools of their independence. This is how authoritarian regimes like Russia control education and suppress dissent.Source: Wall Street JournalAirport Detentions Have Travelers \u2018Freaked Out\u2019What Happened: Immigration lawyers, travel consultants, and foreign residents report an unprecedented level of fear around international travel due to escalating detentions, electronic device seizures, and secondary screenings under Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Even U.S. citizens are taking precautions, like traveling with burner phones, as reports grow of travelers being detained over expunged records or social media content.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s weaponization of border enforcement is creating an authoritarian climate where political expression, ethnicity, and digital footprints can be grounds for detention. This is undermining civil liberties, inflicting lasting damage on the tourism economy, and causing many countries to issue travel warnings to the U.S.Source: The AtlanticTexas Republicans Advance Bill to Seize Control of State UniversitiesWhat Happened: Texas lawmakers are pushing S.B. 37, a sweeping bill that would give the state power to control faculty hiring, academic programs, and course content across public universities, claiming it's needed to eliminate \u201cideological bias\u201d in higher education.Why It Matters: This bill mirrors Trump\u2019s authoritarian playbook\u2014a political takeover of public universities that strips faculty of independence, undermines academic freedom, and hands control of curricula to politicians. Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsSpy Agencies Do Not Think Venezuela Directs Gang, Declassified Memo ShowsWhat Happened: A newly released intelligence memo confirms U.S. spy agencies do not believe Venezuela\u2019s government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, directly contradicting Trump\u2019s justification for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to disappear Venezuelans without due process to a gulag in El Salvador.Why It Matters: Trump manufactured a \u201cnational security threat\u201d to strip immigrants of due process and push mass deportations\u2014using it as a test case to claim unchecked executive power and bypass the law and Constitution. It\u2019s a classic authoritarian tactic to create an \u201cemergency\u201d to strip freedoms.Source: New York Times\u201cDesigned to Scare People\u201d: Lawyers Warn of Self-Deportation Notices Posted in Immigration CourtsWhat Happened: Trump officials have begun distributing \u201cself-deportation\u201d notices in immigration courts, even alongside asylum approvals, urging immigrants to leave voluntarily using a new CBP app or face fines, detention, and permanent bans. Lawyers say the flyers, now seen in courtrooms nationwide, are misleading, legally dangerous, and falsely suggest official judicial backing.Why It Matters: The notices are part of a broader campaign to pressure immigrants into abandoning their legal rights, using fear and disinformation to drive up deportation numbers while sidestepping judicial oversight. Attorneys warn that the tactic is coercive, misleading, and could lead to unlawful removals.Source: Mother JonesRwanda Confirms Early Talks to Host Deported US MigrantsWhat Happened: Rwanda\u2019s foreign minister confirmed that preliminary discussions are underway with the U.S. to receive migrants, possibly including financial support for integration programs like housing and job assistance.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to outsource deported migrants to third countries like Rwanda raises serious human rights concerns, given Rwanda\u2019s record of repression and involvement in regional conflicts.Source: Associated Press\u2018A Slippery Slope to Eugenics\u2019: Advocates Reject RFK Jr\u2019s National Autism DatabaseWhat Happened: Autism advocates and researchers condemn a new federal database spearheaded by RFK Jr., which will compile information on autistic individuals for a research study. Officials deny it is a registry, but critics argue the so-called \u201creal-world data platform\u201d raises serious ethical, privacy, and civil rights concerns.Why It Matters: Critics warn the project could stigmatize autistic people, erode trust in medical research, and set a dangerous precedent for surveillance without consent\u2014what some call a slippery slope toward eugenics. Public outrage has surged, with nearly 50,000 petitioners demanding that the plan be stopped.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Used Multiple Signal Chats for Official Pentagon BusinessWhat Happened: Hegseth used Signal for official Pentagon business more extensively than previously known, participating in at least a dozen chats. He instructed aides to use the app to notify foreign governments about U.S. military operations and discussed sensitive matters like travel, media, and scheduling, all outside official communication channels.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s Pentagon chief is leaking military plans on unsecured apps, bypassing official protocols, and violating records laws\u2014creating chaos at the highest levels of command and endangering national security. This is illegal, and anyone else would be fired and potentially prosecuted.Source: Wall Street JournalSignal Clone Used by Waltz Suspends Service After \u2018Security Incident\u2019What Happened: TeleMessage, an app used by Trump officials to clone and archive encrypted communications like Signal and WhatsApp, has suspended its services after hackers reportedly breached the system, stealing direct messages and group chats. Why It Matters: This is a major security failure\u2014compromising sensitive communications and exposing the dangers of using third-party surveillance tools to archive encrypted chats. It highlights the Trump regime\u2019s dangerous handling of classified information.Source: New York TimesNewark Air Traffic Controllers Couldn\u2019t See or Talk to Planes, Leading to Last Week\u2019s Airport MeltdownWhat Happened: A major outage on April 28 at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic controllers to lose radar and radio contact with planes, triggering chaos and widespread delays. Some FAA controllers took time off due to stress, and United Airlines slashed 35 daily flights as staffing and infrastructure issues mounted.Why It Matters: The near-total communications failure at one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports exposed dangerous vulnerabilities in the U.S. aviation system.Source: CNBCIRS Has Lost Almost One-Third of Its Tax Auditors After 2 Months of DOGE Cuts, Report SaysWhat Happened: A Treasury watchdog report revealed the loss of 31% of IRS tax auditors\u2014those responsible for scrutinizing wealthy individuals and corporations\u2014in just the first three months of 2025, due to mass purges and resignations.Why It Matters: The purge intentionally cripples the government\u2019s ability to enforce tax laws on the rich, effectively encouraging tax evasion. Source: CBS NewsEurope Drives to Attract Scientists After Trump Freezes U.S. FundingWhat Happened: The European Union launched a sweeping initiative to recruit U.S. scientists after Trump canceled over 380 federal research grants. At an event in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced expanded funding and legal safeguards to protect scientific freedom.Why It Matters: The EU is capitalizing on Trump\u2019s assault on academic research to attract top U.S. talent, threatening America\u2019s global leadership in science. This brain drain is a direct consequence of politicizing research and abandoning core scientific values.Source: NBC NewsThe Latest Trump and DOGE Casualty: Energy DataWhat Happened: The U.S. Energy Information Administration, once the world\u2019s premier source of nonpartisan energy data, has been hollowed out under Trump. Staff purges driven by Musk have led to over 100 departures, the gutting of the Annual Energy Outlook\u2019s analysis section, and the total cancellation of the International Energy Outlook.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate assault on scientific integrity. By crippling the EIA, Trump is silencing trusted energy data and surrendering U.S. leadership in global forecasting.Source: ProPublicaPark Service Suspends Air-Quality Monitoring Across All National ParksWhat Happened: Trump quietly halted a nationwide air-quality monitoring program across all 63 U.S. national parks, issuing stop-work orders to contractors tracking pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. After internal backlash and media exposure, the National Park Service said it would reverse the decision.Why It Matters: The suspension undermines public health and environmental safeguards, especially since the data informs decisions on nearby industrial permits.Source: Washington PostAmid Trump Cuts, Officials Resign From the National Endowment for the ArtsWhat Happened: Senior officials at the NEA resigned en masse after Trump began withdrawing arts grants nationwide and moved to eliminate the agency. Departures include directors overseeing theater, dance, museums, education, and more\u2014crippling the agency's ability to function.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting federal arts funding as part of his broader war on culture. With these resignations, the NEA is being hollowed out from within, clearing the way for its destruction.Source: New York TimesAt Social Security, These Are the Days of the Living DeadWhat Happened: Under Trump\u2019s SSA attack, thousands of Americans\u2014especially immigrants and vulnerable individuals\u2014are being wrongly declared dead or purged from the system, cutting off Social Security benefits, disability payments, and banking access.Why It Matters: The purge has led to delayed or missing payments, wrongful terminations of benefits, and growing evidence of a collapsing administrative infrastructure. This will have devastating effects for millions who depend on Social Security to survive.Source: CBS NewsFEMA Is Ending Door-to-Door Canvassing in Disaster AreasWhat Happened: FEMA will no longer send workers door-to-door in disaster zones to help survivors register for aid, opting instead for fixed assistance centers and \u201ccoordination\u201d with local officials. The change aligns with Trump\u2019s broader plan to dismantle FEMA.Why It Matters: This move strips away one of FEMA\u2019s most essential outreach tools, leaving the elderly, disabled, and isolated without help in moments of crisis. It\u2019s part of a larger effort to gut federal disaster response and abandon vulnerable Americans when they need it most.Source: WIREDNIH Lays Off Hundreds More Staff, Including at Cancer Research InstituteWhat Happened: The National Institutes of Health issued surprise purge notices to nearly 250 employees, including about 50 from the National Cancer Institute.Why It Matters: The layoffs hit critical teams like the Cancer Information Service, cutting off public access to life-saving resources and research. Trump\u2019s war on science\u2014purging experts, dismantling agencies, and slashing health programs\u2014is deadly. This is a deliberate move to make Americans sicker and less informed.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchStarmer Prepares UK for Russian AttackWhat Happened: The British government is quietly updating Cold War-era contingency plans amid growing fears of a direct military attack by Russia, including scenarios involving missile strikes, cyberwarfare, and nuclear threats. The classified plans\u2014drafted by the Cabinet Office\u2019s Resilience Directorate\u2014outline how to transition the UK onto a wartime footing, secure critical infrastructure, and protect top government figures and the Royal Family in the event of a homeland strike.Why It Matters: With Russian threats escalating across Europe and UK military readiness in question, officials are bracing for the unthinkable\u2014a direct attack on British soil. The revival of Cold War-style \u201cWar Book\u201d strategies signals a seismic shift in national security posture and public preparedness.Source: The Telegraph\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPoland\u2019s Duda Tells Trump to Force Putin \u2018To Make Peace\u2019What Happened: Polish President Andrzej Duda publicly urged Trump to use harsh economic sanctions to force Putin into serious negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, declaring Trump the only leader with the power to compel Russia.Why It Matters: Duda\u2019s remarks reflect European worries over Trump\u2019s sham plan\u2014pressuring Ukraine while appeasing Moscow. European leaders have to resort to flattery, knowing Trump responds to ego-stroking, as they scramble to try and influence a narcissistic president.Source: PoliticoMAGA Media Mob: Meet the New Rightwing Faces in the White House Briefing RoomWhat Happened: In a reshaping of press access, Trump has brought in a slate of fringe and far-right extremists\u2014including a disgraced banjo player, conspiracy theorists, and election deniers\u2014to participate in \u201cnew media\u201d briefings led by Karoline Leavitt, sidelining mainstream journalists and amplifying extremist rhetoric.Why It Matters: This is state propaganda in the making\u2014Trump is sidelining the press corps in favor of fringe loyalists to control the narrative and spread disinformation. It\u2019s a direct assault on press freedom and a hallmark of authoritarian rule. This is how the information space is controlled in Russia.Source: The GuardianHow Billionaires Created the DEI PanicWhat Happened: A new investigative report reveals how right-wing billionaires and foundations manufactured decades of outrage around DEI, evolving from 1990s \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d to today\u2019s attacks on DEI, critical race theory, and \u201cwokeness.\u201d Fueled by think tanks and conservative media funded by groups like the John M. Olin Foundation, the campaign framed racial and gender equity as threats to American identity. Why It Matters: The war on DEI is not grassroots outrage\u2014it\u2019s a decades-long, well-financed effort to dismantle civil rights gains. Cloaked in slogans about \u201cmerit\u201d and \u201cfairness,\u201d it aims to preserve racial hierarchies by weaponizing fear. Naming and shaming the funders and strategies behind it is the first step to breaking the cycle.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsFed Confronts Lose-Lose Scenario Amid Haphazard Tariff RolloutWhat Happened: The Federal Reserve faces a dilemma: Trump\u2019s tariffs are fueling inflation while risking recession, forcing the Fed to weigh holding rates versus cutting them amid mixed signals. Officials are expected to delay cuts until labor market data confirms a slowdown, despite growing pressure.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff war has pushed the Fed toward stagflation, complicating its mission and risking delayed or mistimed action.

Small businesses and working-class port communities are especially vulnerable.Source: NPR/WBURThe Flagging Economy Is Hurting the Housing MarketWhat Happened: High interest rates, economic contraction, and Trump\u2019s global trade war are weighing heavily on the housing market, driving up construction costs and pushing many potential buyers out.Why It Matters: As mortgage rates remain high and tariffs add nearly $11,000 to the cost of new homes, builder confidence is slipping and housing starts are down 11%.

I guess my overriding question I\u2019m just not sure of is does Trump actually have what it takes to be a dictator? A wanna be one yea but he has no calculation, no cunning, no ability to think clearly. He also has a non compliant people because we know nothing but democracy. Russia and Eastern Europe has mostly only known autocracy. Of course I\u2019m no expert in this but I think it would be more difficult for him to pull off dictator here no matter how much he or Project 25 might want it, </span></p><div

These deals include a $1 billion Dubai tower, crypto partnerships tied to foreign governments, and a $500,000-per-member private club in D.C. Many of the ventures are coordinated with foreign officials, often in countries where Trump has substantial diplomatic influence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is kleptocracy in action. Trump is openly profiting from the presidency through his sons\\u2019 deals while dismantling oversight and gutting regulatory enforcement. Foreign governments and business elites are paying Trump\\u2019s family for access and protection\\u2014undermining U.S. ethics rules and endangering national security.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/eric-donald-jr-trump-family-deals.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>What We Know About Trump\\u2019s $1.5 Million-a-Head Fund-Raising Dinner</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump headlined a $1.5 million-per-person \\u201Ccrypto and AI\\u201D dinner at his Virginia golf club to raise funds for MAGA Inc., his super PAC that backs loyalist candidates and threatens GOP dissenters. The event featured top crypto allies like David Sacks and was closed to the press.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is selling influence to the highest bidders\\u2014using AI and crypto hype to bankroll his movement, reward loyalists, and shape the GOP into a pay-to-play machine. This is what naked corruption looks like.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-maga-inc-super-pac-dinner.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>A Tiny Company Wants to Buy $20M TRUMP Token to Change U.S.-Mexico Trade Deals</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Freight Technologies, a struggling $4.8M logistics firm, announced plans to buy up to $20 million in a Trump token, claiming the move will promote \\u201Cfair trade\\u201D with Mexico. The firm\\u2019s CEO openly tied the investment to influencing U.S. trade policy under Trump, who has promised private dinners to top token holders.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More pay-to-play schemes. Trump has turned crypto into a tool for corporate influence and political access.

Though Wiles denies participating in those meetings (except one call with General Motors), concerns have been raised over ethics and transparency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With Trump having revoked prior executive orders requiring appointees to recuse from decisions affecting recent clients, Wiles faces no formal restriction, highlighting conflicts of interest and influence peddling inside the White House.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/05/lobbying-white-house-wiles/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>For Trump, the Constitution Is a Hindrance as He Pushes for Deportations</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump openly questioned whether he\\u2019s bound by the Constitution, casting doubt on due process rights while pushing mass deportations. His regime is invoking fringe and unlawful legal theories like the Alien Enemies Act, defying Supreme Court rulings, and demanding the impeachment of judges who block his policies\\u2014all to bulldoze the courts and subvert the rule of law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a textbook authoritarian move\\u2014manufacturing a national \\u201Cemergency\\u201D to override constitutional rights and undermine judicial independence.

Hegseth is eliminating experienced leadership under the pretext of fighting \\u201Cwokeness,\\u201D undermining the chain of command, degrading readiness, and laying the groundwork for authoritarian control\\u2014where illegal orders could be issued and followed without question.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/pete-hegseth-military-cuts.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Wades Into Confirmation Fight Over Controversial Pick for Top DC Prosecutor</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is personally lobbying GOP senators to confirm Ed Martin as U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., despite Martin\\u2019s praise of a Nazi-linked January 6 insurrectionist, repeated nondisclosures, inflammatory media appearances\\u2014and over 200 appearances on Russian state media parroting Kremlin propaganda. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As interim U.S. Attorney, Martin has weaponized the office to serve Trump\\u2019s political agenda\\u2014purging January 6 prosecutors, referring to DOJ staff as \\u201CTrump\\u2019s lawyers,\\u201D and targeting perceived enemies.
