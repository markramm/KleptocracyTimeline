REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File PhotoShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 6Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsFAA Approves Major Increase in SpaceX Starship LaunchesWhat Happened: The FAA approved SpaceX\u2019s request to boost Starship launches from 5 to 25 per year at its Texas site, despite past environmental violations and ongoing legal challenges. Why It Matters: With Trump in power and Musk bankrolling the agenda, federal oversight is being gutted. Musk is steering agencies to benefit his empire\u2014handing himself contracts, dismantling safeguards, and turning \u201cStarbase City\u201d into a test case for corporate self-rule, corruption, and environmental harm.Source: CNBCTop Trump Crypto Buyers Vying for Dinner Seats Are Likely Foreign, Data ShowsWhat Happened: Over half of the top holders of Trump\u2019s meme coin\u2014eligible for a May 22 dinner with Trump\u2014used foreign crypto exchanges that ban U.S. users, raising red flags about foreign influence and pay-to-play corruption.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crypto schemes are drawing shadowy offshore money in exchange for access, bypassing U.S. ethics rules and dismantling crypto oversight to enrich himself, his family, and his allies.Source: BloombergSEC Chief Confirms 15% Staff Loss, Warns of Contract Cuts and ReorganizationWhat Happened: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins told agency staff this week that 15% of the workforce has already left due to Trump\u2019s purge efforts. He warned that more cuts may follow and said a review of business service contracts would begin immediately. This follows months of pressure from Musk, who has increased his presence at the agency.Why It Matters: The SEC \u2014 a key watchdog protecting investors and market integrity \u2014 is being gutted from within. Under Trump and Musk, regulatory enforcement is collapsing, opening the door to unchecked corporate power, self-dealing, and financial instability.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDOGE Enters Homeland Security\u2019s Biometric Hub, Eyes Overhaul of Massive ID SystemsWhat Happened: Musk has gained a foothold in the Office of Biometric Identity Management, which oversees one of the world\u2019s largest biometric databases; sources say Musk\u2019s operatives are now influencing decisions about the long-delayed HART program, meant to replace the IDENT system used across federal immigration and security agencies.Why It Matters: With Musk shaping biometric policy, a vast surveillance infrastructure is being centralized under Trump cronies \u2014 raising urgent concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and the potential for political targeting. Everyone should be alarmed.Source: FedScoop\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsRFK Jr. Linked to Acting U.S. Attorney\u2019s Harassment of Medical JournalsWhat Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin began sending threatening letters to top medical journals questioning their scientific neutrality\u2014shortly after a private meeting with RFK Jr., who has publicly called for legal action against journals like NEJM and JAMA.Why It Matters: The incident exposes a dangerous alliance between Trump\u2019s weaponized justice system and Kennedy\u2019s anti-science agenda\u2014using federal power to intimidate scientific institutions and signaling a broader attack on public health, academic freedom, the First Amendment, and agency independence.Source: Mother JonesG.O.P. Targets a Medicaid Loophole Used by 49 States to Grab Federal MoneyWhat Happened: Congressional Republicans are moving to eliminate a long-standing loophole that allows 49 states to use provider taxes to boost Medicaid payments and draw in federal dollars\u2014potentially banning the loophole under Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts.Why It Matters: Ending the practice would slash billions from red-state Medicaid budgets, forcing cuts to healthcare, education, and tax hikes.Source: New York TimesTrump Kills PBS Kids Grant, Axing $23M in Educational FundingWhat Happened: The Department of Education abruptly ended the Ready To Learn grant program, stripping $23 million from PBS children\u2019s shows like Sesame Street and Clifford, calling the content \u201cwoke propaganda.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader push to defund and dismantle public media, threatening educational access for millions of children and advancing his culture war against trusted public institutions.Source: New York TimesDEA Quietly Ends Body Camera Program, Citing Trump Executive OrderWhat Happened: The Drug Enforcement Administration has quietly ended its body camera program, citing a Trump executive order that reversed a Biden-era mandate for all federal law enforcement to wear the devices. Internal DEA emails confirmed the termination on April 1, and the agency has since removed references to the program from its website.Why It Matters: Ending body camera use at the DEA removes a vital check on abuse and misconduct. Civil rights advocates say it shields law enforcement from accountability. Other agencies, for now, are keeping their cameras underscoring how Trump\u2019s actions are selective, political, and aimed at dismantling oversight.Source: ProPublicaSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsKari Lake Replaces VOA Reporting With Far-Right OAN ContentWhat Happened: Senior Trump adviser Kari Lake announced that Voice of America will begin airing far-right OAN programming to global audiences, sidelining independent journalism while most VOA staff remain on indefinite leave amid ongoing legal battles over their removal.Why It Matters: Trump is transforming America\u2019s global news outlet into a pro-regime propaganda tool, dismantling its independent mandate and sidelining journalists who promote democratic values. This is exactly what happens in Russia.Source: NPRTrump\u2019s Return Fuels Rise of Fringe Conspiracies in GovernmentWhat Happened: From chemtrails to flat Earth theories, extreme conspiracies once confined to internet forums are now promoted by Trump officials, cabinet members, and GOP lawmakers under the guise of policy.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s embrace of extremist conspiracies is transforming fringe propaganda into official policy, corroding democratic norms, inciting violence, and institutionalizing disinformation as a tool of governance.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Targets Harvard, Drops Anti-Semitism PretextWhat Happened: Trump cut off new federal grants to Harvard in a scathing letter attacking the university\u2019s politics and leadership, abandoning its earlier justification of fighting anti-Semitism.Why It Matters: This confirms that Trump\u2019s true aim is to punish liberal institutions, using federal power to coerce ideological conformity and set a precedent for future attacks on academic independence.Source: The AtlanticSupreme Court Allows Trump\u2019s Transgender Military Ban to Take EffectWhat Happened: The Supreme Court lifted a lower court injunction, allowing Trump to temporarily reinstate his ban on transgender military service while legal challenges proceed \u2014 despite opposition from liberal justices and Biden-era reversals.Why It Matters: This decision enables Trump to resume discharging transgender service members, rolling back hard-won LGBTQ rights and military inclusion, and signaling the Court\u2019s growing deference to discriminatory policies under the pretext of military authority.Source: ABC NewsTrump to Deport Migrants to Libya Using Military PlaneWhat Happened: Trump is planning to deport migrants to Libya\u2014using a U.S. military aircraft\u2014despite the country\u2019s brutal detention centers, ongoing conflict, and U.S. government warnings against travel due to \u201ccrime, terrorism, and armed conflict.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is violating international norms by sending vulnerable people into documented torture conditions and continues to weaponize the U.S. military to carry out mass expulsions.Source: New York TimesWoman says Boston hotel guard told her to leave bathroom because she \u2018was a man\u2019What Happened: A cisgender woman was forcibly removed from the women\u2019s restroom at Boston\u2019s Liberty Hotel after security wrongly accused her of being a man. Her partner, also cisgender, witnessed the incident, and both were thrown out. The hotel initially defended the action but reversed course following backlash, suspending the guard and pledging retraining and LGBTQ+ support.Why It Matters: This is outrageous and underscores the dangerous consequences of transphobic panic and gender policing, fueled by Trump culture wars and anti-LGBTQ+ executive orders. Though the couple is cisgender, they endured the same public humiliation and discrimination trans people face daily\u2014revealing how bigoted policies foster a climate of fear and suspicion that harms everyone.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchSignal Clone Used by Trump Officials Exposed User Chats in PlaintextWhat Happened: Security researcher Micah Lee revealed that TM Signal, a Signal knockoff used by Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, transmits chat logs to an archive server without end-to-end encryption, contradicting the company\u2019s security claims and exposing sensitive government communications to potential breaches.Why It Matters: The app\u2019s glaring security flaws pose a grave national security threat. On top of Trump\u2019s mounting security breaches, high-level officials are using a platform that falsely mimics trusted encryption, leaving sensitive U.S. communications wide open to espionage. Senator Ron Wyden has called for a DOJ investigation, though no one will be held accountable.Source: WIREDWhite House Removes NTSB Vice Chair Alvin Brown Amid Broader PurgeWhat Happened: The Trump White House removed National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chair Alvin Brown, a Biden appointee and the first Black mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, continuing a pattern of ousting Democrats from independent federal agencies.Why It Matters: Brown\u2019s dismissal weakens transportation oversight at a time of rising aviation safety concerns and accidents, and underscores Trump\u2019s effort to purge government watchdogs and consolidate control across all independent regulatory bodies.Source: USA TodayInternal VA Emails Reveal How Trump Cuts Jeopardize Veterans\u2019 Care, Including To \u201cLife-Saving Cancer Trials\u201dWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s VA is slashing care for veterans, shutting down life-saving clinical trials for cancer, addiction, and brain injuries. Over 1,000 vets have already lost access to treatment. Despite public claims of support, internal emails show chaos, stalled programs, and warnings from staff being ignored.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting the VA while pretending to \u201cput veterans first.\u201d The cuts come despite a congressional mandate under the PACT Act to expand care for veterans exposed to toxic substances. Experts warn this chaos is putting lives at risk and dismantling trust in the VA. Veterans are being sacrificed for budget optics and political theater.Source: ProPublicaDNI Tulsi Gabbard Reused Weak Passwords Across Multiple Accounts for YearsWhat Happened: Leaked records reveal Tulsi Gabbard reused the same weak, easily guessable password across multiple personal accounts\u2014including email, Dropbox, and LinkedIn\u2014for years. The breach underscores a reckless disregard for national security, especially given her participation in a Signal group where sensitive U.S. military strike details were shared.Why It Matters: Gabbard\u2019s lax cybersecurity put U.S. secrets at risk. Reusing a weak password while handling intelligence isn\u2019t just sloppy\u2014it\u2019s reckless, showing she lacks the judgment, discipline, and reliability needed for any national security role.Source: WIREDKennedy Aide and Vaccine Critic Questions Recent Expert RecommendationsWhat Happened: Dr. William \u201cReyn\u201d Archer III, a senior aide to RFK Jr. and vocal vaccine skeptic, is challenging CDC panel recommendations to expand Pfizer and GSK\u2019s RSV vaccines and a meningitis shot, demanding more data on efficacy and safety.Why It Matters: With RFK Jr. holding final authority in the absence of a CDC director, expert-driven vaccine policy is being overridden by far-right ideology\u2014threatening science-based public health decisions.Source: ReutersTrump Signals Plan to Eliminate FEMAWhat Happened: Kristi Noem told lawmakers that Trump wants to abolish FEMA, proposing block grants to states instead. This follows Trump\u2019s January remarks that FEMA \u201cshould go away.\u201dWhy It Matters: Dismantling FEMA would gut the federal government\u2019s core disaster response system just as climate disasters intensify, leaving states to manage billion-dollar crises with limited resources and eroding national emergency readiness.Source: USA TodayControllers Briefly Lost Contact With Newark Planes, Triggering Nationwide Flight DisruptionsWhat Happened: A radar and communications outage on April 28 at Philadelphia\u2019s control center caused air traffic controllers to lose contact with planes en route to Newark Airport. The disruption triggered countrywide delays and cancellations, made worse by staffing shortages.Why It Matters: The outage exposed serious weaknesses in America\u2019s aviation infrastructure and reignited calls to modernize air traffic control\u2014just as Trump pushes a multibillion-dollar overhaul that critics say prioritizes privatization over safety.Source: Associated PressTrump Budget Cuts Trigger Layoffs at Renewable Energy LabWhat Happened: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory laid off 114 staff\u20143% of its workforce\u2014due to Trump\u2019s cuts, stop work orders, and anti-renewable energy directives.Why It Matters: Trump continues to gut clean energy research to favor fossil fuel interests, sabotaging climate innovation and green jobs.Source: ReutersTrump to Eliminate Energy Star and Key Climate Divisions at EPAWhat Happened: Trump plans to shut down the EPA\u2019s Energy Star program and eliminate divisions focused on climate and energy efficiency, undermining decades of bipartisan work on pollution reduction and consumer savings.Why It Matters: Cutting Energy Star\u2014praised for saving Americans $40 billion a year\u2014guts climate policy, cripples emissions tracking, and puts corporate polluters ahead of public health and savings for Americans.Source: CNNColumbia Lays Off Nearly 180 After Trump Pulls $400M in FundingWhat Happened: Columbia University announced the layoff of nearly 180 staff after Trump canceled $400 million in federal funding, with research projects and medical studies now paused or scaled back as the university struggles to fill the gap.Why It Matters: The politically motivated funding cut is already inflicting long-term damage on scientific research and academic freedom, illustrating how Trump is using federal power to punish dissent and force universities into compliance with his ideological agenda.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchCarney to Trump: Canada \"Won\u2019t Be for Sale, Ever\" Amid Tariff TensionsWhat Happened: In a tense Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected Trump\u2019s repeated propaganda that Canada would become the 51st U.S. state, reaffirming Canadian sovereignty while urging Trump to lift harsh tariffs.Why It Matters: The confrontation underscores a deepening rift with America\u2019s closest ally. Trump\u2019s annexation rhetoric and aggressive trade policies are straining decades of economic partnership and mutual respect, replacing diplomacy with nationalist bullying.Source: BBCTrump to Rename Persian Gulf in Nod to Arab AlliesWhat Happened: Trump plans to announce that the U.S. will officially rename the Persian Gulf as the \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d or \u201cGulf of Arabia\u201d during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, aligning with Gulf Arab states that reject the historically recognized term \u201cPersian Gulf.\u201dWhy It Matters: This symbolic but inflammatory move favors Trump\u2019s autocratic allies and reinforces that his foreign policy is shaped by personal profit and political loyalty, not history or U.S. interests, as the Saudis pour billions into Trump\u2019s businesses and projects.Source: Associated PressXi Touts Decline of U.S. Power as Trump Rebuilds Ties with MoscowWhat Happened: As Trump restarts U.S.-China trade talks, Xi Jinping traveled to Moscow to deepen the China-Russia \u201cno-limits\u201d alliance and promote a multipolar world order\u2014directly challenging U.S. global leadership.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff policies have opened the door for Xi to rally countries around an anti-U.S. axis, accelerating the decline of American influence and reshaping global power dynamics.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchOrder by Hegseth to cancel Ukraine weapons caught White House off guardWhat Happened: In January, Hegseth abruptly ordered the cancellation of 11 weapons shipments to Ukraine, catching the White House and national security officials off guard. Though Trump discussed halting aid, no formal directive was issued at the time of cancellation.Why It Matters: This exposes deepening chaos within Trump\u2019s national security team, reiterating that critical military decisions are shaped by MAGA loyalty tests rather than strategic coherence or national security expertise.Source: ReutersTrump Asked Ukraine to Accept U.S. Deportees Amid WarWhat Happened: Trump quietly urged Ukraine to accept deportees from third countries. Why It Matters: This is complete insanity\u2014Trump is weaponizing U.S. foreign aid again to bully Ukraine, under Russia\u2019s genocidal assault and dependent on aid, into taking deportees, even as they fight for survival. Source: The Washington PostHow Ohio became a hotbed of white supremacism, spreading its tentacles globallyWhat Happened: Once a centrist bellwether, Ohio has transformed into a major center of American white supremacist activity\u2014fueling global extremism, grooming minors online, and producing some of the country\u2019s most violent radicals.Why It Matters: This metastasizing far-right movement has deadly real-world consequences\u2014from the tragic radicalization to a surge in hate crimes, terror plots, and neo-Nazi propaganda across Ohio. The Trump regime\u2019s silence\u2014and alignment with extremists\u2014emboldens white supremacists who now view the federal government not as a check on their violence, but as a partner.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Dismisses Need for Trade Deals as UK and India Strike PactWhat Happened: Trump declared the U.S. doesn't need trade deals during his meeting with Canadian PM Mark Carney, contradicting his ongoing trade talks with China and sparking market declines; meanwhile, the UK and India finalized a bilateral trade agreement to eliminate most tariffs within a decade.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s protectionist stance isolates the U.S. from new global trade frameworks, undermines his officials\u2019 negotiations, and risks ceding economic leadership to rising powers forging agreements without American involvement.Source: CNBCFord Hikes Prices on Mexico-Made Models Due to Trump TariffsWhat Happened: Ford raised prices by up to $2,000 on three popular Mexico-built vehicles\u2014the Mustang Mach-E, Maverick, and Bronco Sport\u2014citing new costs from Trump\u2019s auto tariffs.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade war is driving up car prices, hurting consumers, and fueling industry uncertainty.Source: ReutersUPS and FedEx Once Handled a Deluge of Packages From China. That\u2019s Changing.What Happened: Trump ended a loophole allowing duty-free imports under $800 from China, triggering a collapse in low-value shipments and threatening billions in revenue for UPS, FedEx, and DHL.Why It Matters: The move escalates Trump's trade war and drives up consumer costs, while undercutting U.S. delivery giants and disrupting global e-commerce supply chains.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Judge Blocks Trump from Shutting Down Three Federal AgenciesWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s order to close agencies supporting libraries, minority-owned businesses, and labor mediation, ruling it violated constitutional limits on executive power.Source: ReutersJudge Blocks Trump from Canceling $1.1B in COVID School AidWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump from rescinding over $1.1 billion in pandemic recovery funds for K-12 schools, siding with a coalition of Democratic-led states suing to protect the aid.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Order to Sanitize Black History Meets Institutional ResistanceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s executive order to purge \u201cimproper ideology\u201d from federally supported cultural institutions triggered the revocation\u2014and quiet reversal\u2014of grants, targeting places like the Whitney Plantation and the Smithsonian\u2019s African American Museum.
