Credit Eric Lee for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 25Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: Zoom Zoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsSilicon Valley Launches Pro-AI PACs to Defend Industry in MidtermsWhat Happened: Venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI president Greg Brockman, and other tech leaders are bankrolling Leading the Future, a new super-PAC network pouring over $100 million into the midterms. The group\u2019s mission is to block strict AI rules, push industry-friendly policies, and unseat candidates seen as hostile to rapid AI deployment.Why It Matters: Big Tech is buying influence to rig AI rules in its favor, copying crypto\u2019s playbook. By dumping money into elections, Silicon Valley is turning AI oversight into a partisan weapon\u2014protecting profits while gutting public safeguards.Source: Wall Street JournalIndia Hires US Lobbying Firm With Trump Ties as Tariffs LoomWhat Happened: India\u2019s embassy hired Mercury Public Affairs, a lobbying firm tied to Trump insiders, including Susie Wiles, for $75,000 a month as 50% tariffs on Indian goods take effect. Why It Matters: The deal highlights how foreign governments see Trump\u2019s inner circle as gatekeepers, reinforcing the corruption and transactional nature of U.S. foreign policy under his regime.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Says He Is Removing Lisa Cook From the Federal Reserve BoardWhat Happened: Trump announced the removal of Lisa Cook, the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve Board, citing unproven mortgage fraud allegations. Legal experts warn that the firing is likely unlawful under the Federal Reserve Act, which allows dismissal only for proven cause. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, vowed to fight the move in court.Why It Matters: This is a blatant power grab that destroys the Fed\u2019s independence. By ousting Cook and stacking loyalists, Trump is turning the central bank into a political tool that will destabilize global markets and erode investor trust in the United States.Source: New York TimesTrump Enlists More Agencies in His Crackdown on Washington, D.C.What Happened: Trump issued an executive order expanding federal oversight of D.C. by directing the Transportation and Housing Departments to investigate safety in federally funded housing and transit systems. The order widens his public safety \u201cemergency\u201d crackdown, already marked by a federal police takeover and National Guard patrols in the city.Why It Matters: Trump is extending his control of the capital beyond policing into housing and transit, placing entire sectors of city life under federal scrutiny. The move undermines local governance, weaponizes federal agencies against D.C., and normalizes authoritarian oversight of daily civic functions. D.C. is the test case.Source: New York TimesThe Texas Redistricting Fight Has Been the Testing Ground for the Trump Administration\u2019s Latest Legal StrategyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ forced Texas to redraw its congressional map mid-decade, using lawsuit threats to give Abbott and Paxton cover for a plan adding up to five GOP seats. The move is part of a wider strategy of using courts to bypass legislatures and deliver partisan wins.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the courts to entrench GOP power, sidestep democratic checks, and erode constitutional norms. It\u2019s a test run for using legal pressure as a tool of control.Source: ProPublicaAfter U.S. Takes Stake in Intel, Trump Pledges \u2018Many More\u2019 DealsWhat Happened: Days after the U.S. acquired a 10% stake in Intel with $8.9 billion in taxpayer funds, Trump vowed to pursue similar interventions across other industries, saying he aims to \u201cget as much as I can.\u201d The move scraps safeguards in the CHIPS Act, immediately handing cash to Intel while giving Trump direct leverage over its future.Why It Matters: This is state capitalism in action, echoing models in Russia and China. By nationalizing parts of private industry, Trump is politicizing corporate decisions, risking taxpayer losses, and undermining market trust while consolidating personal control over the economy.Source: New York TimesTrump Order Deepens National Guard\u2019s Role in US Law EnforcementWhat Happened: Trump signed an order creating a specialized D.C. Guard unit to enforce federal law and a nationwide quick reaction force for rapid deployment to cities. The move expands his use of the military in policing, despite violent crime being at historic lows.Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s push to militarize domestic law enforcement, bypass state authority, and intimidate political opponents. By deputizing Guardsmen as federal police, he is eroding the civilian-military divide that underpins American democracy and turning America into a police state.Source: Military.com\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsThe weapons that National Guard troops now carry in Washington, D.C.What Happened: Most of the 2,300 National Guard troops deployed in Washington, D.C., are now carrying M17 pistols and M4 semiautomatic rifles. Defense officials say deadly force is authorized only for imminent threats, though armed patrols now roam tourist areas and downtown streets.Why It Matters: Trump has escalated the militarization of D.C. policing, putting assault-style rifles on city streets. The move blurs the line between civilian law enforcement and military force, deepening authoritarian control and a police state.Source: NBC NewsCBP Had Access to More than 80,000 Flock AI Cameras NationwideWhat Happened: Customs and Border Protection tapped into Flock\u2019s nationwide license plate reader network, running searches across more than 80,000 cameras. Local police departments said they didn\u2019t realize their systems were being accessed, prompting Flock to announce it has paused all federal pilots.Why It Matters: Local policing tech has quietly morphed into a nationwide federal dragnet, enabling immigration enforcement without oversight. Even states with bans saw their data swept in, exposing how easily policing tools can become mass surveillance infrastructure.Source: 404 MediaTrump Signs Orders Aimed at Ending Cashless Bail PoliciesWhat Happened: Trump signed executive orders to roll back cashless bail in Washington, D.C., and threatened to cut federal funding to states and cities that use it. The move expands his federal control of the capital\u2019s justice system, directing suspects to be charged with federal crimes and held in federal custody to bypass local bail reform.Why It Matters: This is another step in Trump\u2019s power grab over D.C. and Democratic-led cities, using manufactured crime fears to justify federal overreach. By weaponizing the funding and policing powers, he is undermining local autonomy. Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsDC students head back to school amid Trump's law enforcement surgeWhat Happened: As 100,000 D.C. students returned to class, Mayor Muriel Bowser rejected Trump\u2019s deployment of more than 2,300 National Guard troops, calling it unnecessary given plunging crime rates. Despite local safety programs already in place, armed Guard units are stationed at Metro stops and around the city, raising concerns after a military vehicle accident last week.Why It Matters: Trump is militarizing the school commute as he continues building a police state. Stationing troops at metro stops and near schools blurs the line between education and policing, normalizing an armed federal presence in daily life while eroding local control over community safety.Source: ABC NewsTrump says flag burning incites violence and riot. A Supreme Court ruling cast doubt on that claim.What Happened: Trump signed an executive order directing the DOJ to prioritize prosecutions of Americans who burn the U.S. flag, even though the Supreme Court has ruled the act is protected speech. To bypass the constitutional barrier, the order instructs prosecutors to pursue alternative charges such as disorderly conduct or property destruction.Why It Matters: Trump is reviving culture-war battles by trying to criminalize protected speech, defying decades of constitutional precedent. By reframing dissent as disorder and urging prosecutions, he is testing the limits of free expression while pushing the courts toward restrictions on protest.Source: ABC NewsTrump Threatens to Investigate Chris Christie Over \u2018Bridgegate\u2019What Happened: Trump threatened to reopen investigations into Chris Christie\u2019s 2013 \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal after the former New Jersey governor criticized his use of the Justice Department for political purposes. The move came days after the FBI raided John Bolton\u2019s home and office, another Trump critic.Why It Matters: Trump continues using the Justice Department to intimidate critics, including former allies, by dredging up old \u201cscandals.\u201d It mirrors Kremlin tactics, where Russia weaponizes decades-old \u201callegations\u201d to punish opponents and target anyone who falls out of favor with the regime.Source: New York TimesJudge Threatens to Hold Trump Official in Contempt Over Silencing of Voice of AmericaWhat Happened: A federal judge warned he may hold Kari Lake in contempt for defying his order to restore Voice of America programming after Trump effectively shut it down in March. Despite the ruling, VOA remains gutted, with just four languages broadcasting an hour a day, while officials floated plans to replace content with far-right OANN and Newsmax.Why It Matters: By again ignoring court orders, Trump\u2019s cronies are eroding constitutional checks and undermining U.S. credibility abroad. It\u2019s a dangerous step toward replacing independent journalism with state-controlled propaganda.Source: New York TimesThe Trump administration\u2019s new weapon against foes: Mortgage filingsWhat Happened: Trump has turned mortgages into a political weapon. FHFA chief Bill Pulte referred supposed mortgage fraud cases against Fed governor Lisa Cook, New York AG Letitia James, and Rep. Adam Schiff\u2014three Trump enemies\u2014to the DOJ, bypassing normal oversight. The probes are based on disputed paperwork about primary residences.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian abuse of financial data\u2014fabricating \u201cfraud\u201d claims to intimidate and remove opponents. It mirrors Kremlin tactics, where the state invents charges to sideline critics.Source: Washington Post'They're going to be brought down': Trump vows to go after Biden's advisersWhat Happened: Trump vowed to \u201cbring down\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s former advisers, calling them \u201cevil people\u201d in Oval Office remarks while surrounded by his top aides. The threat comes as his regime pursues investigations of political opponents.Why It Matters: Trump is openly promising retribution, weaponizing the Justice Department to target his predecessor\u2019s allies. The rhetoric cements his authoritarian playbook\u2014criminalizing opposition and turning state power into a tool for revenge.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJustice Department won\u2019t defend grants for Hispanic-serving colleges, calling them unconstitutionalWhat Happened: The Justice Department said it will not defend a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions, arguing it is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d The move aligns the regime with a Tennessee lawsuit backed by Students for Fair Admissions, the group that ended affirmative action.Why It Matters: Over 500 colleges serving two-thirds of Latino undergraduates depend on this funding to narrow achievement gaps. By abandoning the program, Trump escalates his push to dismantle diversity and equity efforts, putting critical resources for Latino students at risk.Source: Associated PressKilmar Abrego Garcia Taken Into ICE Custody, Facing Deportation to UgandaWhat Happened: ICE detained Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador, and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. A federal judge quickly blocked his removal, issuing an order to prevent DHS from transferring him while his legal challenge proceeds.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine is lawless\u2014wrongly disappearing migrants to third countries, and trampling due process. Source: CBS NewsWhen immigration shows up at daycare: crackdown in DC terrifies families and workersWhat Happened: Immigration raids in Washington, D.C., are spreading fear to schools and daycares, where parents report unmarked cars, armed agents, and checkpoints near drop-offs. Nannies are staying home, schools are running special buses, and families are drafting letters instructing ICE not to seize their children if caregivers are detained.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s federal takeover has turned daily childcare into a site of fear and intimidation. By targeting immigrant parents and workers, the crackdown is destabilizing schools, undermining children\u2019s safety, traumatizing kids, and normalizing raids in spaces once off-limits.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchPentagon\u2019s tech innovation head abruptly steps downWhat Happened: Doug Beck, head of the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit, abruptly resigned Monday with no explanation. A former Apple executive, Beck had been a key link to Silicon Valley and pushed for faster, cheaper tech adoption in defense.Why It Matters: Beck\u2019s exit is part of a broader purge hollowing out Pentagon leadership, as Trump and Hegseth drive out senior officials and force resignations. The exodus is destabilizing the Defense Department at a critical moment, weakening its ability to function and endangering national security.Source: PoliticoTrump Administration Plans to Cancel Maryland Offshore Wind ProjectWhat Happened: Trump officials told a federal court that it will move to vacate approval for US Wind\u2019s offshore project off Maryland\u2019s coast by September 12. The Biden-approved project, designed to power 718,000 homes, is the latest clean energy initiative Trump has sought to block, following his suspension of offshore leasing and a stop-work order on a Rhode Island wind farm.Why It Matters: Canceling the Maryland project is another setback for U.S. clean energy, halting efforts to cut emissions and tackle climate change. By blocking offshore wind, Trump is favoring his fossil fuel donors and reshaping energy policy around partisan ideology instead of environmental and national priorities.Source: ReutersSome FEMA staff warn that Trump cuts may weaken disaster responseWhat Happened: On the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, 180 FEMA employees wrote to Congress warning that Trump\u2019s cuts and unqualified leadership could cripple the agency in a crisis. Staff said leaders installed by Kristi Noem have eroded capacity, sidelined experts, and undermined the reforms Congress passed after Katrina.Why It Matters: Trump is hollowing out FEMA at the height of hurricane season, leaving the U.S. unprepared for natural disasters. By sidelining experienced staff and installing subservients, he\u2019s turning emergency management into another arena for political control\u2014at the cost of public safety.Source: ABC NewsUS CDC Taps Vaccine Skeptic to Lead COVID CommitteeWhat Happened: The CDC appointed Retsef Levi, a critic of mRNA vaccines, to lead its COVID-19 immunization workgroup. Levi has previously claimed the shots cause \u201cserious harm and death,\u201d including in children, and joins a panel reshaped after RFK Jr. purged all 17 prior members earlier this year.Why It Matters: By elevating conspiracy theorists of proven vaccines, Trump is undermining trust, fueling disinformation, and politicizing life-or-death medical guidance.Source: ReutersAs measles surged in Texas, Trump administration's actions hampered CDC's responseWhat Happened: An investigation found that Trump\u2019s interference with CDC communications and staffing paralyzed the agency during the worst U.S. measles outbreak in three decades. With reports censored, experts sidelined, and staff purged, local health officials in Texas said they were left \u201call alone\u201d as the outbreak spread to six states and Mexico, sickening 4,500 and killing at least 16.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s politicization of the CDC turned a preventable outbreak into a deadly crisis. By silencing scientists, stalling data, and undermining trust in vaccines, his regime tied the hands of frontline responders\u2014leaving communities vulnerable and exposing how political control over public health costs lives.Source: CBS NewsUS Commerce voids Biden's $7.4 billion semiconductor research grant dealWhat Happened: The Commerce Department announced it is voiding Biden\u2019s $7.4 billion grant agreement with Natcast, a nonprofit created to run the National Semiconductor Technology Center. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called Natcast an \u201cillegal semiconductor slush fund\u201d stacked with Biden allies, and said the National Institute of Standards and Technology will take over operations.Source: Reuters\u2018Heartbreaking\u2019 transportation cuts hit home in GOP districtsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s GOP megabill cut $2.2 billion from a Biden-era program funding transportation fixes in disadvantaged neighborhoods, wiping out projects in red districts like Utah\u2019s St. George, Kentucky\u2019s Bowling Green, and rural Maryland. Even solidly pro-Trump communities are losing long-promised upgrades to roads and safety.Why It Matters: The cuts show Trump\u2019s drive to erase Biden programs is hurting his own voters, stripping funding for core infrastructure while dismissing projects as \u201cDEI and Green priorities.\u201d Communities that backed him now face stalled highways, lost grants, and worsening congestion.Source: PoliticoRFK Jr. Is Getting Personal Authority Over Who to Kick Off MedicaidWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget bill cut $911 billion from Medicaid and imposed new work requirements, forcing most recipients to work 80 hours a month. RFK Jr. now has sweeping authority to decide who qualifies as \u201cmedically frail\u201d and can get exemptions, putting millions of chronically ill and disabled people at risk of losing coverage.Why It Matters: This hands dictatorial power over Medicaid eligibility to RFK Jr., whose movement blames people for their illnesses and ties care to economic productivity. It\u2019s a backdoor way to slash the safety net, punish the sick, and widen inequality under the guise of \u201creform.\u201dSource: Mother Jones\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchBaltic States Seek to Fight Back Against Russian Signal JammingWhat Happened: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reported a surge in Russian GPS jamming and spoofing that now disrupts 85% of Estonian flights and has spread to shipping and ground communications. The Baltic states, joined by Finland, Sweden, and Poland, have escalated complaints to the UN\u2019s ITU and ICAO.Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s electronic warfare is a direct attack on NATO, endangering civilians and testing allied resolve. By jamming navigation in the Baltics, Moscow is using hybrid warfare to divide allies and weaken NATO\u2019s strength.Source: Bloomberg Trump Weighs Sanctions on EU Officials Over Tech LawWhat Happened: Trump is considering sanctions on European officials enforcing the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, which he claims \u201ccensors\u201d Americans and unfairly burdens U.S. tech companies. The unprecedented move\u2014likely visa restrictions\u2014would escalate already fraught U.S.-EU relations amid tariff threats and Trump\u2019s broader campaign against U.S. allies.Why It Matters: Sanctioning EU officials over a tech law would shatter norms and escalate tensions with Europe. The EU designed the DSA to fight Russian disinformation, but Trump is twisting it into a culture-war fight\u2014weaponizing sanctions against allies in a way usually reserved for enemies.Source: ReutersUS Orders More Ships to Southern Caribbean With \u201cEye\u201d on Drug CartelsWhat Happened: The U.S. deployed additional warships to the southern Caribbean, including the USS Lake Erie and USS Newport News, as part of Trump\u2019s campaign against Latin American cartels. This follows last week\u2019s amphibious squadron deployment carrying 4,500 troops, including 2,200 Marines, off the coast of Venezuela.Why It Matters: Trump is branding cartels as \u201cnarco-terrorists\u201d to militarize the fight, but the label looks like cover for a wider operation. The buildup hints he may be using \u201ccartels\u201d as a pretext for launching U.S. military action in Venezuela.Source: ReutersMaduro Cites Rubio\u2019s \u2018Madness\u2019 and Sends 15,000 Troops to BorderWhat Happened: Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro deployed 15,000 troops to the Colombian border as the U.S. sent three warships with 4,000 sailors and Marines to the Caribbean. Maduro blasted Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s \u201cmadness,\u201d warning that Trump\u2019s escalation could spark a regional crisis.Source: BloombergTrump Repeatedly Praises North Korea\u2019s Dictator in Meeting With South\u2019s PresidentWhat Happened: During an Oval Office meeting with South Korea\u2019s President Lee Jae Myung, Trump repeatedly praised North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, stressing their \u201cgood rapport\u201d and even offering to arrange a meeting between Kim and Lee. The remarks came just weeks after North Korea rebuffed Lee\u2019s overtures, further straining Seoul\u2019s position.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s fawning over Kim in front of South Korea\u2019s president undercuts a key U.S. ally while legitimizing one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators. It signals to the world that Trump values personal ties with authoritarians over strategic alliances.Source: New York TimesBurner phones, wiped socials: the extreme precautions for visitors to Trump\u2019s AmericaWhat Happened: Foreign visitors are taking extreme precautions when traveling to the U.S.\u2014using burner phones, wiping socials, and deleting private data\u2014amid rising reports of detentions and invasive device searches. Canada, Australia, and other countries have updated travel advisories, warning citizens they could be denied entry for political views or personal content.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s border regime weaponizes surveillance to intimidate travelers, chilling free expression and tarnishing America\u2019s democratic image. Fear of phone searches for \u201cbad opinions\u201d shows how authoritarian tactics are reshaping global perceptions of the U.S.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchThe Ukrainian Attacks That Are Forcing Russia to Ration Its FuelWhat Happened: Ukrainian drone strikes have knocked out 13% of Russia\u2019s fuel production, hitting refineries, rail networks, and pipelines from Crimea to Siberia. The attacks, combined with Western sanctions that limit repairs, have led to rationing at gas stations, increased prices, and exposed deep vulnerabilities in Russia\u2019s energy lifeline.Why It Matters: Ukraine\u2019s strikes are crippling Russia\u2019s economic engine, showing how asymmetric warfare can turn the country\u2019s size into a weakness. By hitting oil and gas, Kyiv is effectively enforcing sanctions, striking at the foundation of Putin\u2019s genocidal invasion machine.Source: Wall Street JournalAs mass deportation intensifies, right-wing media expand their aim to include American citizensWhat Happened: As Trump\u2019s deportation machine accelerates, MAGA media propagandists have broadened their attacks from undocumented immigrants to naturalized and native-born citizens. Jack Posobiec, Matt Walsh, and Charlie Kirk now question whether non-white and Muslim Americans are \u201creal\u201d Americans, pushing denaturalization and deportation of political opponents.Why It Matters: This is a full-on attack on citizenship itself, redefining who counts as American by race and ideology. By pushing the idea that even legal citizens can be erased, MAGA media are paving the way for authoritarian policies that weaponize identity and destroy pluralism.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump vows \u2018substantial\u2019 new tariffs, chip restrictions on countries with digital taxesWhat Happened: Trump threatened \u201csubstantial\u201d new tariffs and export restrictions on U.S. chips against any country that maintains digital services taxes. He framed the levies\u2014used by more than a dozen nations to target Big Tech\u2014as discriminatory and boasted that Canada already \u201ccaved\u201d by dropping its tax under U.S. pressure.Why It Matters: Trump is once again weaponizing tariffs and chip exports to shield U.S. tech giants. The strategy has already fractured trade ties and undermined alliances, and doubling down risks deeper supply chain shocks while turning U.S. policy into a tool of political coercion.Source: CNBC NewsA Deere in the Tariff HeadlightsWhat Happened: Deere & Co. reported a 26% drop in profits and is laying off 238 workers as Trump\u2019s tariffs add $600 million in costs this year. The company cites higher steel, aluminum, and component prices plus falling exports as reasons for the hit.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are hurting U.S. manufacturers and farmers, fueling layoffs and record trade deficits. His erratic policies are punishing workers\u2014exposing the hollowness of the GOP\u2019s economic agenda.Source: Wall Street JournalAustralia Post Pauses US-Bound Parcel ShipmentsWhat Happened: Australia Post suspended parcel deliveries to the U.S. after Trump scrapped a customs rule that let low-value packages enter duty-free. The move follows similar pauses by European carriers like Swiss Post and DHL, which warned the new rules make shipments costlier and more complicated.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff and customs changes are disrupting global mail and e-commerce flows, straining businesses and consumers. By unraveling duty-free trade, he risks sparking wider retaliation and pushing U.S. allies into economic standoffs.Source: ReutersSwiss Post to Suspend US Goods Shipments After Tariff CrackdownWhat Happened: Swiss Post will suspend shipments of goods to the U.S. starting Aug. 26 after Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d tariff exemption for low-value imports. Packages from Switzerland will now face a 39% tax or flat duties of $80\u2013$200 per item, hitting Swiss businesses and consumers.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff crackdown is disrupting global trade flows, forcing national postal systems to halt U.S. deliveries. By scrapping the exemption, the regime is driving up costs, straining supply chains, and isolating American consumers from international markets.Source: BloombergAs tariff shock sets in, small toymakers fear for holiday stockpiles, even survivalWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs on Chinese imports have devastated small toymakers, with imports plunging nearly 50% and prices for toys rising six times faster than inflation. Family-run WS Game Co. expects up to a 30% revenue loss and warns it won\u2019t have enough stock for the holiday season.Why It Matters: Small businesses are being crushed by Trump\u2019s tariff chaos, forced to raise prices, cut jobs, or shut down. The toy industry\u2019s crisis shows how erratic trade policy is hurting American companies and turning holiday survival into economic whack-a-mole.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501With Trump\u2019s Takeover, Washington Finds a Mission to ResistWhat Happened: Since Trump declared a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in D.C. and flooded the city with federal agents and National Guard troops, Washingtonians have responded with protests. Residents have jeered regime officials, disrupted arrests, banged pots and pans outside the White House, and demanded D.C. statehood as federal forces patrol their streets and set up checkpoints.Source: New York TimesChicago Vows to Challenge Trump\u2019s National Guard PlansWhat Happened: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker pledged to fight Trump\u2019s plan to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, calling it unconstitutional and vowing to take the regime to court. The move follows troops in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles as he lies that Democratic-led cities are \u201ckilling fields\u201d and \u201cinvaded\u201d by criminals.Source: Wall Street JournalJudge rules Utah\u2019s congressional map must be redrawn for the 2026 electionsWhat Happened: A Utah judge ruled the GOP-drawn 2021 congressional map unlawful, saying lawmakers violated voters\u2019 rights by gutting an independent commission and splitting Salt Lake County to ensure Republican dominance. The state must quickly redraw maps for the 2026 midterms, though GOP appeals could delay changes until 2028.Source: The GuardianTrump administration to restore $6.8bn in education funds after multi-state suitWhat Happened: Trump agreed to restore $6.8 billion in frozen education funds after 23 states sued, accusing him of illegally withholding money Congress had already appropriated.

Legal experts warn that the firing is likely unlawful under the Federal Reserve Act, which allows dismissal only for proven cause. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, vowed to fight the move in court.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a blatant power grab that destroys the Fed\\u2019s independence.

The order widens his public safety \\u201Cemergency\\u201D crackdown, already marked by a federal police takeover and National Guard patrols in the city.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is extending his control of the capital beyond policing into housing and transit, placing entire sectors of city life under federal scrutiny. The move undermines local governance, weaponizes federal agencies against D.C., and normalizes authoritarian oversight of daily civic functions. D.C. is the test case.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/us/politics/trump-dc-dot-hud.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>The Texas Redistricting Fight Has Been the Testing Ground for the Trump Administration\\u2019s Latest Legal Strategy</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s DOJ forced Texas to redraw its congressional map mid-decade, using lawsuit threats to give Abbott and Paxton cover for a plan adding up to five GOP seats. The move is part of a wider strategy of using courts to bypass legislatures and deliver partisan wins.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the courts to entrench GOP power, sidestep democratic checks, and erode constitutional norms. It\\u2019s a test run for using legal pressure as a tool of control.</p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-redistricting-trump-lawsuits-courts\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>After U.S. Takes Stake in Intel, Trump Pledges \\u2018Many More\\u2019 Deals</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Days after the U.S. acquired a 10% stake in Intel with $8.9 billion in taxpayer funds, Trump vowed to pursue similar interventions across other industries, saying he aims to \\u201Cget as much as I can.\\u201D The move scraps safeguards in the CHIPS Act, immediately handing cash to Intel while giving Trump direct leverage over its future.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is state capitalism in action, echoing models in Russia and China.

Guard unit to enforce federal law and a nationwide quick reaction force for rapid deployment to cities. The move expands his use of the military in policing, despite violent crime being at historic lows.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This escalates Trump\\u2019s push to militarize domestic law enforcement, bypass state authority, and intimidate political opponents. By deputizing Guardsmen as federal police, he is eroding the civilian-military divide that underpins American democracy and turning America into a police state.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/08/25/trump-order-deepens-national-guards-role-us-law-enforcement.html\\\\\\\">Military.com</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>The weapons that National Guard troops now carry in Washington, D.C.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Most of the 2,300 National Guard troops deployed in Washington, D.C., are now carrying M17 pistols and M4 semiautomatic rifles. Defense officials say deadly force is authorized only for imminent threats, though armed patrols now roam tourist areas and downtown streets.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has escalated the militarization of D.C. policing, putting assault-style rifles on city streets.

Local police departments said they didn\\u2019t realize their systems were being accessed, prompting Flock to announce it has paused all federal pilots.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Local policing tech has quietly morphed into a nationwide federal dragnet, enabling immigration enforcement without oversight.

The move expands his federal control of the capital\\u2019s justice system, directing suspects to be charged with federal crimes and held in federal custody to bypass local bail reform.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another step in Trump\\u2019s power grab over D.C. and Democratic-led cities, using manufactured crime fears to justify federal overreach.

Despite local safety programs already in place, armed Guard units are stationed at Metro stops and around the city, raising concerns after a military vehicle accident last week.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is militarizing the school commute as he continues building a police state.

A Supreme Court ruling cast doubt on that claim.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order directing the DOJ to prioritize prosecutions of Americans who burn the U.S. flag, even though the Supreme Court has ruled the act is protected speech. To bypass the constitutional barrier, the order instructs prosecutors to pursue alternative charges such as disorderly conduct or property destruction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is reviving culture-war battles by trying to criminalize protected speech, defying decades of constitutional precedent.

Despite the ruling, VOA remains gutted, with just four languages broadcasting an hour a day, while officials floated plans to replace content with far-right OANN and Newsmax.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By again ignoring court orders, Trump\\u2019s cronies are eroding constitutional checks and undermining U.S. credibility abroad.

The Biden-approved project, designed to power 718,000 homes, is the latest clean energy initiative Trump has sought to block, following his suspension of offshore leasing and a stop-work order on a Rhode Island wind farm.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Canceling the Maryland project is another setback for U.S. clean energy, halting efforts to cut emissions and tackle climate change.
