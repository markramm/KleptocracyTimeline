Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 1Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsRural Internet Program on Hold as Musk\u2019s Satellites Get New ConsiderationWhat Happened: Trump has paused the rollout of the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, originally launched under Biden to expand high-speed internet access in underserved rural areas via underground fiber-optic cables. The program is now being revamped to prioritize a \u201ctech-neutral\u201d approach, potentially favoring satellite providers like Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink.Why It Matters: Rural communities may lose reliable internet as years of planning are scrapped in favor of Musk\u2019s satellites\u2014raising red flags of corruption and self-dealing.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsThe CDC Has Been GuttedWhat Happened: Thousands of CDC employees were abruptly laid off under a Trump executive order to \u201cstreamline\u201d the federal workforce. The purge hit vital public health programs\u2014HIV prevention, lead poisoning, reproductive health, and environmental safety\u2014leaving buildings inaccessible and operations paralyzed. Entire divisions, including Environmental Health and HIV Prevention, were dismantled.Why It Matters: Experts warn the cuts will lead to unnecessary deaths, especially in rural and underserved areas. Programs tracking HIV, childhood lead poisoning, and air quality have collapsed overnight. \u201cThis is catastrophic,\u201d one doctor said. \u201cThis is coming for you.\u201dSource: WIREDRepublicans Want to Reshape the Courts to Propel Trump\u2019s Agenda \u2014 Even If It Could Cost ThemWhat Happened: GOP lawmakers are pushing legislation to limit federal district courts\u2019 ability to issue nationwide injunctions. Bills introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa and supported by Sen. Chuck Grassley would restrict injunctions to apply only to parties involved in the lawsuit.Why It Matters: This is an attack on the courts\u2014the last line of defense against authoritarianism. This would weaken judicial oversight and undermine checks on Trump\u2019s executive authority.Source: NOTUSMusk Floats Lies About Social Security, Immigrants as DOGE Seeks ChangesWhat Happened: At a Wisconsin town hall, Musk and his operative Antonio Gracias lied that immigrants are receiving Social Security numbers and benefits improperly, presenting lawful processes as scandalous. They alleged that noncitizens are being issued Social Security numbers too freely and implied that this allows them to vote\u2014despite no legal basis or evidence for such claims.Why It Matters: This is a calculated disinformation campaign aimed at stoking xenophobia and undermining trust in the Social Security system and electoral integrity\u2014both of which Trump and Musk want to dismantle. Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsWhite House Firing of Career Prosecutor Sparks Fears of Political PurgeWhat Happened: Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schleifer was fired by a White House official via email\u2014an unprecedented move that bypassed standard Justice Department procedures. The firing came just one hour after far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted a call to remove Schleifer over past comments criticizing Trump. Schleifer, a respected career prosecutor, had previously run for Congress.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling safeguards to bend the Justice Department to his will. It threatens the independence of prosecutions and sends a chilling message to career prosecutors: fall in line or get out.Source: NBC NewsMusk to Fire All USAID Diplomats and Local Staff, Shuttering Foreign Aid AgencyWhat Happened: Musk is finalizing the complete dismantlement of USAID, ordering the termination of all U.S. diplomats, civil servants, and over 10,000 locally hired staff worldwide. According to a conference call summary, every position at the agency will be eliminated by September, ending more than 60 years of global aid work.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are killing off America\u2019s flagship aid agency out of spite and ideology. The move guts lifesaving programs in war zones, abandons allies, and hands power to authoritarian regimes\u2014 like Russia and China.Source: The GuardianFCC Chair Threatens ABC\u2019s Broadcast License Over Disney DEI PracticesWhat Happened: FCC Chair Brendan Carr announced an investigation into Disney\u2019s hiring practices, warning that ABC\u2019s broadcast license could be at risk. Carr said evidence suggests Disney and ABC may have violated FCC equal employment opportunity rules by basing employment decisions on race and gender under their DEI policies.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal agencies to silence media. Threatening to strip ABC\u2019s license over \u201cDEI\u201d is an attack on the free press\u2014and an authoritarian move.Source: The HillWidespread Layoffs, Purge of Leadership Underway at U.S. Health AgenciesWhat Happened: Trump launched a sweeping purge of the Department of Health and Human Services, resulting in thousands of layoffs and the removal or reassignment of senior leaders at the CDC, NIH, and FDA. Employees were fired, reassigned to remote posts, or placed on administrative leave, with some discovering they had lost their jobs when their badges stopped working.Why It Matters: Slashing 20,000 public health jobs guts America\u2019s ability to fight disease, protect drug safety, and respond to crises. The reorganization will cripple national health agencies\u2019 ability to respond to public health crises and violates federal law.Source: Washington PostDOGE Demands Deep Cuts at Humanities EndowmentWhat Happened: Trump and Elon are demanding deep staffing and program cuts at the National Endowment for the Humanities. Up to 80% of the agency\u2019s staff may be let go, and grants issued under the Biden administration are facing cancellation.Why It Matters: This is an ideological attack on American culture and history. Slashing NEH funding threatens museums, libraries, and local heritage projects in every district. The National Humanities Alliance condemned the move as an assault on a crucial, low-cost agency with a nationwide impact.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUS Revokes Visa of Ex-Costa Rican President After Trump CriticismWhat Happened: Former Costa Rican President \u00d3scar Arias, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said the U.S. revoked his visa shortly after he criticized Trump for acting like \u201ca Roman emperor\u201d and accused the U.S. of bullying smaller nations. Why It Matters: This is political retaliation against a foreign leader for criticizing Trump. He is using U.S. immigration power to punish foreign critics and suppress international dissent\u2014further shredding America\u2019s credibility and democratic values on the world stage.Source: The GuardianTrump Announces Deal With Law Firm Employing Doug EmhoffWhat Happened: Trump announced a White House agreement with Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the firm employing Doug Emhoff, to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal services. Why It Matters: This marks the third major legal firm deal tied to Trump\u2019s regime, raising red flags over coercion and conflict of interest. Trump is targeting firms that once opposed him\u2014turning law firms into instruments of state power to silence legal dissent.Source: CNNWith Trump\u2019s crackdown against dissent escalating, some seeking to protest his immigration policies face a difficult choiceWhat Happened: As Trump expands efforts to suppress dissent, noncitizens \u2014 including visa holders, DACA recipients, and legal permanent residents \u2014 now face heightened risks for protesting. At immigration town halls, activists warned that exercising constitutional rights could lead to deportation or loss of legal status.Why It Matters: The regime\u2019s sweeping immigration powers and retaliatory crackdowns on protesters and institutions are a direct assault on democratic freedoms. For millions of immigrants, dissent now carries the risk of detention or deportation\u2014silencing voices through fear.Source: CNN\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE Admits \u2018Administrative Error\u2019 Deported Legal Maryland Resident to El Salvador PrisonWhat Happened: ICE acknowledged it wrongly deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia\u2014a Maryland resident with legal protections\u2014to the notorious prison in El Salvador. He was mistakenly sent to CECOT, a facility known for human rights abuses.Why It Matters: Trump is refusing to repatriate him, citing his alleged gang ties and claiming it lacks power over El Salvador. Human rights advocates say this is a grave abuse of government power, highlighting the dangers of Trump\u2019s immigration purge and ICE\u2019s unchecked authority.Source: Associated PressImmigrant Students Sent to Notorious Louisiana Detention CentersWhat Happened: At least three immigrant students\u2014Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, and Alireza Doroudi\u2014were detained by ICE and transferred to remote ICE facilities in rural Louisiana, a region flagged by human rights groups for abuse and lack of legal access. Why It Matters: The facilities have a record of human rights violations and are in a jurisdiction hostile to immigrants. Experts say the transfers are a deliberate tactic to isolate detainees, limit legal aid, and stack the legal odds in Trump\u2019s favor.Source: NBC NewsNaval Academy Removes Nearly 400 Books in DEI Purge Ordered by Hegseth\u2019s OfficeWhat Happened: The U.S. Naval Academy pulled nearly 400 books from its library following a directive from Hegseth\u2019s office to eliminate materials promoting DEI. The purge occurred ahead of Hegseth\u2019s visit and follows a broader Trump regime crackdown on \u201cDEI\u201d across federal agencies.Why It Matters: This is a racist and misogynistic censorship campaign aimed at whitewashing history and enforcing ideological purity in the military. By gutting inclusive leadership training, Trump is pushing a dangerous agenda of control, fear, and division inside the armed forces.Source: Associated PressInside ICE Air: Deportation Flights Run by Civilian Crews Raise AlarmsWhat Happened: Civilian flight attendants working for Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX), Trump\u2019s top deportation flight contractor, have raised serious concerns about safety, ethics, and medical emergencies aboard ICE Air charters. In one harrowing case, a shackled child with asthma nearly died mid-flight, with little medical help onboard.Why It Matters: The use of civilian crews on deportation flights\u2014often misled about the job\u2014has become routine under Trump. Flight staff say they\u2019re untrained to handle detainees in distress and fear a disaster is imminent. Trump\u2019s shift from military to private deportation flights masks humanitarian risks under the guise of efficiency.Source: ProPublicaU.S. Looks for More Countries to Take MigrantsWhat Happened: Trump is quietly negotiating with governments in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe to accept deported migrants the U.S. no longer wants\u2014especially when their home countries refuse or delay their return. Among the countries approached were Libya, Rwanda, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova, Mongolia, and Kosovo. Some may receive U.S. funds or political favors in return.Why It Matters: This controversial plan\u2014led by Stephen Miller\u2014follows February\u2019s Panama deal, where over 100 Middle Eastern migrants were deported with little regard for their asylum status. This offshoring of deportation raises serious human rights concerns. Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchWaltz and Staff Used Gmail for Government Communications, Officials SayWhat Happened: National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and his staff reportedly used personal Gmail accounts to conduct official government business, including conversations involving sensitive military information. Documents reviewed by The Washington Post show that at least one senior aide used Gmail to discuss weapons systems and military positions during an active conflict. Waltz himself has had schedules and work documents sent to his personal account.Why It Matters: The use of unsecured email for government business raises serious national security and operational integrity concerns. Signalgate keeps getting worse and worse, yet there is zero accountability or investigation. It underscores the regime\u2019s blatant disregard for U.S. national security and military.Source: Washington PostHow NORAD Could Be Hurt by U.S.-Canada TensionsWhat Happened: Gen. Gregory Guillot, head of NORAD, warned that if Trump\u2019s trade war fractures the U.S.-Canada alliance, the Pentagon would lose key radar coverage over the Arctic\u2014potentially leaving America blind to missile threats. Canada\u2019s PM declared the defense relationship \u201cover\u201d amid growing political strain.Why It Matters: NORAD depends on Canadian radar sites for early warning. A breakdown could take years and billions of dollars to rebuild, leaving U.S. airspace vulnerable. Trump\u2019s policies are straining critical military alliances and creating national security risks.Source: Defense OneDoctor Behind Award-Winning Parkinson\u2019s Research Among Scientists Purged From NIHWhat Happened: At least 10 top scientists at the National Institutes of Health were abruptly fired. Among them is Dr. Richard Youle, a world-renowned expert on Parkinson\u2019s disease and recipient of the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. NIH leaders said they were blindsided and confused by the removal of senior researchers in brain, aging, HIV, and infectious disease research.Why It Matters: These firings gut America\u2019s leading medical research agency and threaten vital progress on diseases like Parkinson\u2019s, HIV, and Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s a political purge of science\u2014and Americans will pay the price.Source: WIREDTrump Cuts FDA Staff Handling Bird Flu OutbreaksWhat Happened: Around 140 staff were fired from the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, including those overseeing the federal response to the ongoing bird flu outbreaks. Why It Matters: These layoffs gut the FDA\u2019s ability to manage and contain animal disease outbreaks like bird flu, which has already spread to household pets. This endangers public health, weakens food safety protections, and prioritizes political ideology over science.Source: USA TodayHHS layoffs hit Meals on Wheels and other services for seniors and disabledWhat Happened: The Department of Health and Human Services fired over 40% of staff at the Administration for Community Living, jeopardizing Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors and disabled Americans. Entire teams, like the Division of Energy Assistance, were eliminated\u2014threatening programs like LIHEAP that help 5.9 million low-income households afford heating and cooling.Why It Matters: With the ACL gutted and no clear replacement plan, programs supporting tens of millions of vulnerable Americans will collapse. The layoffs will leave seniors, disabled people, and the poor to face rising costs, food insecurity, and health risks without federal aid.Source: NPRTransportation Dept Sends New Buyout Offer to WorkersWhat Happened: The U.S. Transportation Department offered voluntary buyouts to thousands of employees\u2014excluding public safety and cybersecurity personnel. Workers must decide by April 7 to accept the offer.Why It Matters: This second-round buyout, driven by Musk, accelerates Trump\u2019s federal purge. While safety workers are exempt, critics warn that hollowing out transportation infrastructure staff will impair oversight and weaken regulatory enforcement.Source: USA Today\u2018Chaos\u2019: Trump cuts to Noaa disrupt staffing and weather forecastsWhat Happened: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is reeling after Trump cut over 1,000 staff and compromised the agency\u2019s operations. Firings affected critical roles, including hurricane trackers, some of whom were later hastily rehired. NOAA\u2019s switch to an unsecured email server led to staff being flooded with spam. Meanwhile, weather forecasting tools like balloon launches have been scaled back.Why It Matters: NOAA is vital for public safety during extreme weather events. The cuts and disorganization jeopardize hurricane and tornado warnings, risking lives. The chaos illustrates the dangerous consequences of politicizing science and slashing federal expertise.Source: The GuardianPrinceton Says Trump Is Halting Research Grant FundingWhat Happened: Princeton University became the fourth Ivy League school to have federal research funding suspended by Trump. President Chris Eisgruber said several dozen grants from agencies like the Energy Department, NASA, and the Defense Department were halted. Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s war on universities\u2014punishing schools for protests and views he doesn\u2019t like. It\u2019s a blatant attempt to suppress academic freedom and weaponize federal funding to enforce political loyalty and enact Trump\u2019s ideology.Source: Wall Street JournalFederal Firings and Office Closures Create Concerns for MinersWhat Happened: Nearly 900 staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were fired. The closures include critical offices in Morgantown, WV, and Pittsburgh, PA, which support coal miner health, including black lung screening and silica dust monitoring.Why It Matters: The United Mine Workers of America says these cuts threaten coal miner safety and health. With offices that handle black lung diagnosis and silica exposure monitoring shut down, miners will lose access to life-saving research, screenings, and benefits.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchWhite House Studying Cost of Greenland Takeover, Long in Trump\u2019s SightsWhat Happened: Trump is preparing a formal cost estimate for turning Greenland into a U.S. territory, exploring how much it would cost to provide services for its 58,000 residents and what revenue could be extracted from its natural resources. This follows Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that the U.S. should \u201cget\u201d Greenland \u2014 by purchase or potentially force.Why It Matters: This is reprehensible\u2014a brazen imperialist move that mirrors Putin. By trying to buy or seize sovereign land from a NATO ally, Trump will destabilize global alliances, undermine international law, and drag the U.S. into a diplomatic crisis.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchSenior Russian Official to Visit Washington for Trump Talks Despite SanctionsWhat Happened: Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and Putin\u2019s wallet, is expected to visit Washington this week for talks with Steve Witkoff. Trump temporarily lifted U.S. sanctions to grant Dmitriev a visa.Why It Matters: This is an outrageous normalization of a sanctioned Putin operative and war criminal. Trump continues serving Russia\u2014and opens the door for more Russian war criminals to be welcomed in Republican circles.Source: CNNRightwing Groups Push Library Book Bans in Culture War ExpansionWhat Happened: Conservative groups across the U.S. are backing new state-level legislation to restrict access to school and public library books deemed \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201csexually explicit,\u201d with a focus on LGBTQ+ themes and racial content. At least 112 such bills are active, and classics like The Color Purple and Slaughterhouse-Five are among the targeted titles.Why It Matters: The bans would undermine intellectual freedom and aim to impose conservative ideologies on public institutions. The bills censor diverse perspectives, strip librarians of their autonomy, and infringe on parental rights for families who support inclusive education. Some laws have already been ruled unconstitutional\u2014but the censorship push is accelerating.Source: The GuardianTop Trump USAID Staffer Accused of Violent Outbursts, Racist RemarksWhat Happened: Jeremy Lewin, a 28-year-old Trump and Musk operative serving as deputy administrator of USAID, is under scrutiny for a troubling past\u2014including alleged racist comments, violent behavior, and a police report accusing him of threatening a girl with a knife. Why It Matters: A man accused of racist outbursts and violent behavior now controls what\u2019s left of America\u2019s foreign aid apparatus. This is in line with many other Trump officials and staff.Source: Rolling Stone\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsEU Has a \u2018Strong Plan\u2019 to Retaliate on Trump Tariffs, Says von der LeyenWhat Happened: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that the EU is prepared to impose \u20ac26 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods\u2014including jeans and Harley-Davidsons\u2014following Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariff hikes. More tariffs could hit semiconductors, pharma, and timber, with options on services and tech also on the table.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade war will fracture transatlantic relations and trigger a global economic backlash. The EU says it didn\u2019t start this confrontation but will defend its industries. Retaliation could escalate into a full-blown trade standoff, with tech, agriculture, and auto sectors caught in the crossfire.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Tariffs Are Coming, but at a Cost to U.S. AlliancesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s upcoming so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs have rattled global allies. Germany is preparing to shift away from U.S. defense ties, Canada has declared the military alliance \u201cover,\u201d and Poland is considering acquiring its own nuclear deterrent. Greenland\u2019s prime minister rejected Trump\u2019s attempt to claim the island, saying, \u201cWe decide our own future.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s reckless tariffs and fealty toward Moscow are unraveling decades of U.S. alliances. Allies are forging new ties without Washington, while Trump lashes out with threats of massive retaliation. The damage to America\u2019s credibility, trade, and global security leadership will be lasting\u2014and self-inflicted.Source: New York TimesTariff Woes Depress US Manufacturing, Erode Labor DemandWhat Happened: U.S. manufacturing contracted in March for the first time in three months, according to the Institute for Supply Management. New orders dropped to their lowest level since 2023, factory layoffs increased, and job openings fell by nearly 200,000. A key measure of input prices hit a three-year high.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up costs, shrinking demand, and eroding confidence. Manufacturing is slowing, inflation is rising, and economists warn of stagflation. The Fed is stuck\u2014with fewer tools to stabilize a weakening economy.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsElon Musk Tried to Buy Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court. He Lost.What Happened: Progressive Susan Crawford defeated Musk- and Trump-backed Brad Schimel in Wisconsin\u2019s high-stakes Supreme Court race, despite Musk pouring $25 million into the race and handing out $1 million checks to voters. The liberal majority on the court is now secure through at least 2028.Source: Mother JonesRepublicans Win Florida Special Elections\u2014but by Narrower MarginsWhat Happened: Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine won special House elections in Florida\u2019s deep-red districts, both backed by Trump. Despite the wins, Democrats significantly narrowed margins compared to 2024, fueled by record fundraising and backlash to Trump and Musk.Source: Associated PressCivil Rights Groups Sue Trump Over Citizenship Proof OrderWhat Happened: Civil rights organizations, including the NAACP and ACLU, filed a federal lawsuit against Trump\u2019s March 25 executive order mandating documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The plaintiffs argue the order will disenfranchise millions\u2014particularly voters of color and low-income Americans\u2014by imposing costly and burdensome ID requirements.Source: ABC NewsCory Booker Sets Record with 25-Hour Senate Speech Against TrumpWhat Happened: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) spoke for 25 hours and 5 minutes on the Senate floor to protest Trump\u2019s authoritarian actions, setting the record for the longest continuous Senate speech in U.S. history\u2014surpassing Strom Thurmond\u2019s infamous 1957 filibuster of civil rights legislation.Source: Associated PressOver 1,900 Researchers Warn of \u201cAssault on Science\u201d Under TrumpWhat Happened: Nearly 2,000 scientists and engineers\u2014including elected members of the National Academies of Sciences\u2014issued a public letter condemning Trump\u2019s \u201cwholesale assault\u201d on science. The signatories point to canceled research funding, mass firings at health agencies, deleted government data, and politically motivated shutdowns of scientific studies as a grave threat to public welfare and democratic governance.Source: ABC News23 States and D.C. Sue Trump Over $11B Public Health CutsWhat Happened: A coalition of 23 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against Trump and RFK Jr. over the elimination of $11 billion in public health funding. The money\u2014originally allocated by Congress\u2014supports vaccination access, disease tracking, mental health care, and pandemic preparedness.

How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?More Retaliatory Visa Cancellations? \u2014 After revoking the visa of Nobel Peace Prize winner \u00d3scar Arias, will Trump escalate the use of U.S. agencies to silence other international leaders and critics?A Full Court Press on the Judiciary \u2014 With GOP bills to limit federal court powers gaining traction, will Trump move to ignore legal challenges to his executive orders?Greenland Takeover Plan Details \u2014 Will the White House formally present its illegal annexation plan, and how will Denmark and NATO allies respond to this imperialist move?April 2 Tariff Announcement \u2014 Will Trump impose a blanket 20% tariff or target specific nations and industries?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policy is raising prices for Americans and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.Weaponizing Federal Power \u2014 Whether it\u2019s the payroll system, intelligence agencies, or academic grants, Trump and Musk are seizing control of critical levers of government to reward allies, punish critics, and centralize authority.Weaponized Immigration \u2014 Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is no longer just about border enforcement\u2014it\u2019s being used to punish dissent, gut humanitarian programs, and silence political opposition at home and abroad.Censorship as Policy \u2014 From purging DEI books at military academies to threatening media licenses, Trump is using the full weight of the federal government to enforce ideological purity.The Courts Are Under Siege \u2014 Republican efforts to limit injunctions and judicial review mark a dangerous power grab that could remove the judiciary as the only check on executive overreach and power grab.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

and besmirching of America's once good reputation.  I found the revokation of the Costa Rican ex-president's visa simply contemptible, so too the inexplicable firing of Dr. Youle. The assault on the judiciary, the craven capitulation of another major law firm, the attack on another prestigious university, the abominable tariffs- Trump's America is behaving like a drunken  bully lashing out at all and sundry. An epitome of the president himself.  Our government has taken on the personalty of Trump himself- violent, paranoid, petty, vengeful, suffering ideological dementia.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div

Waltz himself has had schedules and work documents sent to his personal account.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The use of unsecured email for government business raises serious national security and operational integrity concerns.
