Its aim: to sow discord, promote Donald Trump, and damage Hillary Clinton\u2026Read more7 days ago \u00b7 83 likes \u00b7 8 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Family Profits Even With Tepid Launch of Crypto TokensWhat Happened: The Trump family\u2019s World Liberty Financial token flopped on its trading debut, but a side deal with Alt5 Sigma \u2014 chaired by ally Zach Witkoff with Eric Trump on its board \u2014 ensured hundreds of millions in guaranteed payouts.Why It Matters: Trump has erased ethical guardrails, turning presidential power into a vehicle for family profit. A shaky crypto launch still delivered a windfall, underscoring how corruption is now conducted in plain sight.Source: New York TimesTrump Family Amasses $5 Billion Fortune After Crypto LaunchWhat Happened: The Trump family amassed a paper fortune of up to $5 billion after the launch of WLFI, the flagship token of their crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Trump and his sons control nearly a quarter of all tokens, making it their most valuable asset, surpassing their real estate empire.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s fortune rests on crypto, entangling his personal wealth with White House policy. With players like Binance chasing favors, World Liberty is a corrupt pay-to-play pipeline for the Trump family.Source: Wall Street JournalHow Trump and corporations have hobbled US labor watchdogWhat Happened: Trump purged top NLRB officials including general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo and chair Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the labor watchdog without quorum or power to enforce cases. Courts have since sided with corporations like Musk\u2019s SpaceX in blocking unfair labor practice actions, while budget cuts and attrition have further gutted the agency.Why It Matters: The NLRB, once workers\u2019 main shield, has been rendered toothless. By dismantling its independence and siding with billionaires, Trump is rolling back protections to pre-1935 levels, leaving unions and workers defenseless against corporate abuse.Source: Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Military Moves Ratchet Up Threat of State-on-State ConflictWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order creating a special National Guard police unit in D.C. and directing similar forces nationwide, empowered to suppress protests and enforce \u201cpublic safety.\u201d The order also launches a civilian recruitment portal run by Stephen Miller, carrying the hallmarks of a federally sanctioned paramilitary force.Why It Matters: Trump is turning the Guard into his personal police force \u2014 a U.S. version of Russia\u2019s Rosgvardia. If he deploys troops into blue states against governors\u2019 orders, it risks armed clashes between Americans and a full-on constitutional crisis.Source: Rolling StoneIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker says sending military troops to Chicago would be an \"invasion\" by Trump administrationWhat Happened: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker warned that Trump\u2019s plan to send thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago would amount to an \u201cinvasion.\u201d He accused Trump of plotting not just a crime crackdown but an election power grab, calling the move authoritarian. Trump shot back, branding Pritzker \u201cweak and pathetic\u201d and vowing to \u201cstraighten [Chicago] out.\u201dWhy It Matters: Deploying troops over a governor\u2019s objections shatters democratic norms and edges toward martial law. Pritzker\u2019s warning highlights Trump\u2019s authoritarian playbook: manufacture crisis, unleash the military, and weaponize it into a suppression force to target opponents and subvert elections.Source: CBS NewsTrump Says He Will Sign Executive Order Mandating Voter I.D.What Happened: Trump said he will issue an executive order imposing nationwide voter ID, restricting mail-in ballots to the sick and military, and banning voting machines in favor of paper ballots. The Constitution gives states and Congress\u2014not the president\u2014control over election laws, making the order almost certain to be challenged in court.Why It Matters: This is an unconstitutional power grab to centralize elections in the White House. By unilaterally imposing rules that disenfranchise vulnerable voters, Trump is laying the groundwork to try and manipulate the 2026 midterms.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsPardoned Jan. 6 Rioters Now Seek CompensationWhat Happened: Already pardoned by Trump, some Jan. 6 rioters and insurrectionists are now demanding compensation, with lawyers proposing a panel to award financial damages for what they call \u201cunfair prosecutions.\u201d The effort reframes their crimes as victimhood despite convictions for violence and insurrection.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s allies are rewriting Jan. 6, an attack on democracy, into something worth rewarding. Paying insurrectionists signals open season for political violence on Trump\u2019s behalf and shred the rule of law.Source: New York TimesMilitary support to law enforcement is supposed to be temporary. DOD is making it a core missionWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth issued guidance making \u201csealing the border,\u201d deportations, and counter-drug ops the Pentagon\u2019s top priority, even above deterring China. The shift formalizes Trump\u2019s use of the military to aid ICE, patrol U.S. cities, and enforce domestic law \u2014 missions traditionally temporary and outside DOD\u2019s core role.Why It Matters: Trump is reshaping the U.S. military into a domestic police force, draining resources from warfighting and blurring lines between defense and law enforcement. Embedding immigration raids and urban crackdowns into Pentagon strategy moves America closer to a permanent militarized state.Source: Defense OneDOGE Operatives Are Joining Donald Trump\u2019s New National Design StudioWhat Happened: Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, a DOGE operative, was named chief design officer of Trump\u2019s new National Design Studio, which will redesign government websites and digital services. The office is stacked with unvetted DOGE operatives, reviving projects once run by USDS and 18F before Trump dismantled them.Why It Matters: Trump is rebranding gutted programs as a White House-controlled shop, centralizing digital power under unvetted DOGE loyalists. What looks like modernization is actually a political takeover of core government systems.Source: WIREDKristi Noem confirms plan to expand ICE operations in major citiesWhat Happened: Kristi Noem confirmed Trump will expand ICE operations in major cities, including Chicago, and didn\u2019t rule out National Guard deployments. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker warned the plan is an \u201cun-American\u201d abuse of power.Why It Matters: Trump plans on militarizing Democratic-led cities under the guise of immigration raids. Forcing Guard deployments without state consent sets a dangerous precedent of using troops to impose political control on U.S. soil.Source: NBC NewsBondi fires Justice Department employee for gesturing at National GuardWhat Happened: Pam Bondi fired a DOJ paralegal after she flipped off and cursed at National Guard troops deployed in D.C. Bondi said anyone who \u201cdisrespects law enforcement\u201d will no longer work at the department.Why It Matters: Trump and Bondi are purging staff for private expression, weaponizing the Justice Department to punish dissent and tighten control.Source: ReutersTrump Orders Have Stripped Nearly Half a Million Federal Workers of Union RightsWhat Happened: Nearly 450,000 federal employees lost their union protections in August after Trump\u2019s executive orders voided contracts across nine agencies, including the VA, EPA, FEMA, and HHS, in the largest act of union busting in U.S. history.Why It Matters: This strips workers of the ability to fight retaliation, unsafe conditions, and unfair firings, weakening care for veterans, food safety, and public health. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s drive to gut collective bargaining, consolidate control of the federal workforce, and signal to private employers that unions can be crushed without consequence.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump administration to cut 500-plus jobs at Voice of America and its parent agencyWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to purge 532 jobs at Voice of America and its parent U.S. Agency for Global Media, despite a federal judge warning against dismantling the agency without congressional approval. Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying a federal judge by moving to dismantle VOA in violation of the law. By ignoring judicial checks, he\u2019s gutting America\u2019s voice abroad, eroding the rule of law at home, and normalizing executive defiance of the courts.Source: CBS NewsPBS, NPR stations struggle with Trump-fueled government funding cutsWhat Happened: Congress eliminated $1.1 billion in federal funding for PBS and NPR, forcing nearly 600 stations to scramble for survival. Emergency fund drives are bringing in record donations, but staff layoffs, program cuts, and reliance on wealthy donors are already underway, with rural and small-market stations most at risk.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s defunding of public media guts a cornerstone of trusted, local journalism and educational programming. While some stations may survive on donations, many vulnerable outlets could collapse, leaving entire communities without independent news and cultural programming.Source: Associated PressHistorians See Autocratic Playbook in Trump\u2019s Attacks on ScienceWhat Happened: Historians warn Trump\u2019s war on science mirrors tactics of autocrats from Stalin to Orban. In his second term, he has purged scientists, gutted advisory panels, and proposed $44 billion in cuts\u2014slashing basic research while favoring applied technologies like AI and quantum computing that bolster state power.Why It Matters: Suppressing independent science weakens truth as a counterweight to authoritarian rule. By politicizing research and elevating loyalists over experts, Trump is dismantling America\u2019s global leadership and turning science into a tool of control.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsPortrait of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee with Slave Rehung at West PointWhat Happened: The Army confirmed that a portrait of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee \u2014 depicted in uniform with a slave leading his horse \u2014 has been reinstalled at West Point\u2019s library. The move follows Trump and Pete Hegseth\u2019s broader push to restore Confederate tributes, reversing the Naming Commission\u2019s mandate to remove symbols honoring traitors who fought to preserve slavery.Why It Matters: Rehanging a Confederate portrait at West Point is an outrageous glorification of slavery and treason. By whitewashing the Confederacy, Trump is defying Congress and using the U.S. military to legitimize racist rebellion against America.Source: Military.comIn Trump\u2019s Federal Work Force Cuts, Black Women Are Among the Hardest HitWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s sweeping federal workforce cuts have eliminated hundreds of thousands of jobs, disproportionately impacting Black employees\u2014and Black women in particular. High-profile Black women leaders and large shares of Black women at agencies like Education, USAID, IRS, and VA were targeted as demographic reporting was curtailed, obscuring the full scale of the damage.Why It Matters: Trump is deliberately targeting Black employees in government, erasing jobs that built a middle-class path and gutting agencies they help lead. It\u2019s a racist purge that cripples public services and greenlights private employers to dismantle workplace equity.Source: New York TimesJudge blocks deportation of Guatemalan migrant children as flights were ready to take offWhat Happened: A federal judge issued a 14-day restraining order halting Trump\u2019s attempt to secretly disappear 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan children, some already on planes in Texas. The Justice Department claimed it was \u201crepatriation\u201d at Guatemala\u2019s request, but lawyers showed many kids had pending asylum cases.Why It Matters: Trump tried to put kids on planes in the middle of the night, ignoring laws that protect them. The plan to disappear over 600 children without hearings is illegal and inhumane, using vulnerable minors as pawns in his crackdown.Source: CBS NewsA firefighter detained while working at a wildfire in Washington State entered the U.S. at age 4.What Happened: Border Patrol agents arrested two firefighters \u2014 including a 23-year-old who\u2019s lived in the U.S. since age 4 \u2014 while they battled Washington\u2019s Bear Gulch wildfire. Agents tore up the contractor\u2019s agreements and escorted the 42-member crew out of the fire zone.Why It Matters: Arresting firefighters mid-blaze undermines wildfire containment and weaponizes immigration policy against those risking their lives to save communities. It\u2019s cruelty layered with recklessness.Source: New York Times\u2018I\u2019m not coming home\u2019: Trump policy holds people in Ice custody without bailWhat Happened: Trump officials are holding immigrants in ICE custody without bail, even when judges grant release. DHS has ordered lawyers to automatically appeal bond rulings and pause them, keeping people like longtime Queens resident Luis Fernandez detained indefinitely despite raising money for bail.Why It Matters: By stripping away bail, Trump is weaponizing procedure to inflict maximum punishment, breaking families apart and turning immigration courts into tools of coercion.Source: Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTensions rise between Gabbard and CIA chief after her disclosure of undercover officer's name, insiders sayWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard exposed the identity of a covert CIA officer while revoking security clearances for 37 officials, blindsiding CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The officer, a veteran analyst slated for a European post, was ousted after preparing Trump\u2019s Putin summit briefing, deepening tensions between Gabbard and the agency over declassifications and Russia policy.Why It Matters: By weaponizing security clearances to punish perceived \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies, Gabbard and Trump are putting covert officers at risk and hollowing out U.S. intelligence \u2014 another gift to Russia. The purge elevates political loyalty over national security, weakening expertise as global threats intensify.Source: NBC NewsSocial Security Admin.'s chief data officer resigns after filing whistleblower complaintWhat Happened: Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief data officer, resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint accusing Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE of uploading the nation\u2019s entire Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. He described a \u201cculture of panic and dread\u201d inside SSA and said he faced retaliation. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s operatives are centralizing Americans\u2019 most sensitive data on insecure systems, heightening risks of hacking, surveillance, and abuse. Borges\u2019 ouster shows how whistleblowers are being silenced as Trump operatives consolidate control over personal data.Source: CBS NewsTrump administration cancels $679 million for offshore wind projects at portsWhat Happened: Trump canceled $679 million in federal grants for ports that were set to become hubs for offshore wind projects, calling them \u201cwasteful.\u201d The cuts hit 12 ports nationwide, including a $426 million project in Humboldt Bay, CA.Why It Matters: The move guts U.S. offshore wind projects, jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs, higher clean-energy output, and coastal economic growth. Trump\u2019s anti-wind crusade is leaving communities stranded with lost investment, stalled infrastructure, and rising energy costs.Source: NPRTrump wants to axe an affordable housing grant that\u2019s a lifeline for many rural communitiesWhat Happened: Trump moved to eliminate the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, a $38 billion initiative that has built or repaired 1.3 million affordable homes over three decades, many in rural America. The cut threatens towns in Appalachia and poor counties nationwide that rely on HOME to build housing where private investment won\u2019t go.Why It Matters: Cutting HOME kills a crucial lifeline for rural and working-class families. Trump is worsening the housing crisis and hollowing out the very communities that strongly backed him.Source: Associated PressThe Turmoil Inside MAHA Is About More Than Just VaccinesWhat Happened: RFK Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d crusade is imploding, with anti-vaxxers, biotech critics, and pesticide activists feuding over control. FDA scientist Vinay Prasad was hired, fired, and rehired after Kennedy begged Trump, while CDC chief Susan Monarez was purged for straying from MAHA\u2019s extremist vaccine agenda.Why It Matters: The MAGA\u2013MAHA pact is splitting under the weight of its contradictions. Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine, anti-pesticide agenda is colliding with Trump\u2019s industry allies, exposing deep fractures that leave public health policy in chaos.Source: Wall Street JournalTop FDA official demands removal of YouTube videos in which he criticized Covid vaccinesWhat Happened: FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad demanded YouTube delete six videos of himself that had been archived to preserve officials\u2019 pandemic-era statements. YouTube complied, deleting the entire channel of 350 videos featuring Prasad, RFK Jr., and other Trump health officials. Prasad has previously blasted vaccine mandates and defended cuts to health research.Why It Matters: A top federal regulator is erasing his own public record and targeting critics. The takedown highlights how Trump-aligned health officials are rewriting their history, silencing accountability, and tightening control over the Covid narrative.Source: GuardianHow the Fed losing its independence could affect Americans\u2019 everyday livesWhat Happened: Trump moved to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, the first time a president has ever tried to oust a sitting Fed governor. If he succeeds, Trump\u2019s appointees will hold a majority on the Fed board, letting him push steep interest rate cuts despite inflation risks. Economists warn this would politicize monetary policy and destabilize markets.Why It Matters: Fed independence underpins stable prices and borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and small businesses. If Trump seizes control, Americans could face higher inflation, soaring interest rates, and long-term damage to the dollar\u2019s global standing. Source: Associated PressCrime Festers in Republican States While Their Troops Patrol WashingtonWhat Happened: Republican governors in states with some of the nation\u2019s highest violent crime rates sent National Guard troops to Washington to back Trump\u2019s crackdown, even as cities like Memphis, Houston, and Cleveland face worse violence. Trump dismissed deploying troops to red-state cities, falsely claiming they lack serious crime problems.Why It Matters: The selective use of military force shows these deployments are political theater. By using Guard troops as partisan props, Trump and GOP governors are deepening divides while ignoring violence in their own backyards.Source: New York TimesMedicaid cuts threaten rural hospitals \u2014 and access to maternity careWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax law slashes Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, threatening rural hospitals already on the brink. Kentucky alone could lose $11 billion in funding, putting 35 hospitals at risk of closure and forcing women to travel hours for maternity care.Why It Matters: Medicaid covers 4 in 10 U.S. births \u2014 nearly half in rural areas. These cuts will shutter delivery wards, deepen maternal health crises, and leave women without nearby options for safe pregnancies. Source: Washington PostTrump is cutting climate satellites. That could affect weather prediction.What Happened: Trump is cutting climate-monitoring satellites, shutting down carbon-tracking instruments and scrapping sensors for water contamination and greenhouse gases. Budget documents direct NOAA to focus solely on \u201cweather-only\u201d tools, echoing Project 2025\u2019s call to dismantle federal climate research.Why It Matters: Scientists warn the move guts critical climate data that also underpins accurate weather forecasts. By erasing the line between weather and climate, Trump is crippling the nation\u2019s ability to predict disasters, fight pollution, and prepare for the long-term risks of a warming planet.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchPutin Finds a Growing Embrace on the Global StageWhat Happened: At a summit in Tianjin, Putin was warmly embraced by Xi Jinping, Modi, and other Eurasian leaders, marking Russia\u2019s reintegration on the global stage. Once isolated over its genocide in Ukraine, Putin is now benefiting from Trump\u2019s trade wars and diplomatic clashes, which have pushed countries like India and Turkey closer to Moscow.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s foreign policy has eased Russia\u2019s isolation and strengthened Putin\u2019s hand in building a multipolar order. By fracturing Western unity, Trump enables Putin and Xi to pose as stable alternatives, weakening U.S. influence.Source: New York TimesTrump Administration Suspends Visas for PalestiniansWhat Happened: Trump suspended nearly all visa approvals for Palestinian passport holders, ordering U.S. consulates to deny even eligible applicants. The move blocks students, medical patients, and families from entering the U.S.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s escalating clampdown on Palestinians, after bans on Gaza medical emergencies and revoked visas for officials ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. The policy further isolates Palestinians and aligns U.S. immigration with Trump\u2019s rejection of Palestinian statehood.Source: Wall Street JournalChina tries to use Trump turmoil to unite leaders against U.S.-led orderWhat Happened: At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, Xi Jinping urged leaders from Russia, Iran, India, and others to deepen economic ties and build a \u201cmultipolar world\u201d rejecting U.S. dominance. Trump\u2019s trade wars, erratic policy, and clampdowns on allies have helped Beijing and Moscow present themselves as more stable partners.Source: Washington PostGaza postwar plan envisions \u2018voluntary\u2019 relocation of entire populationWhat Happened: A leaked 38-page Trump plan for Gaza, dubbed the GREAT Trust, calls for U.S. control for at least a decade, the forced illegal relocation of 2 million Palestinians into \u201csecure zones\u201d or out of Gaza, and redevelopment into luxury resorts and high-tech hubs. Palestinians who \u201cvoluntarily\u201d leave would be offered $5,000, rent subsidies, and food, while investors are promised hefty returns.Why It Matters: The plan treats Gaza\u2019s devastation as a profit scheme, turning forced displacement into policy and erasing Palestinian statehood. Trump\u2019s team is pushing what critics say is outright ethnic cleansing \u2014 illegal under international law.Source: Washington PostMacron Vows Retaliation If Europe\u2019s Digital Sovereignty AttackedWhat Happened: French President Emmanuel Macron warned that Europe would retaliate if foreign powers, including the U.S., undermine its \u201cdigital sovereignty.\u201d His remarks came after Trump threatened new tariffs and export restrictions on countries with digital services taxes targeting U.S. tech giants like Google and Apple. Why It Matters: Macron is staking sovereignty against U.S. pressure, rejecting Trump\u2019s push to dictate Europe\u2019s digital rules. Trump\u2019s threats risk igniting a wider trade war that could further weaken transatlantic ties.Source: BloombergMaduro vows to declare a \"republic in arms\" if U.S. forces in the Caribbean attack VenezuelaWhat Happened: Venezuelan President Maduro vowed to declare a \u201crepublic in arms\u201d if U.S. forces attack, claiming American warships with \u201c1,200 missiles\u201d pose the greatest threat in a century. Trump has expanded the naval presence in the Caribbean to target \u201cdrug cartels,\u201d deploying destroyers, a cruiser, and assault ships with thousands of Marines.Why It Matters: The standoff risks a regional crisis. Trump\u2019s militarized \u201canti-cartel\u201d campaign looks more like regime change \u2014 and may be cover for a military operation to oust Maduro. Source: CBS NewsNorth Korea's Kim Jong Un travels to Beijing to watch military parade alongside Putin and Xi JinpingWhat Happened: North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un is traveling by train to Beijing to attend a military parade with China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. It\u2019s Kim\u2019s first major multilateral event in 14 years of rule and the first time all three thugs will gather at the same venue.Why It Matters: The Beijing parade is a show of force and solidarity among America\u2019s top adversaries \u2014 one Trump fails to recognize. With Putin, Xi, and Kim side by side, the optics signal a tightening authoritarian bloc prepared to counter U.S. on the global stage.Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPlane carrying EU\u2019s top leader targeted by alleged Russian GPS jammingWhat Happened: A plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was hit by suspected Russian GPS jamming as it tried to land in Bulgaria. Pilots were forced to rely on paper maps, and the flight landed safely.Why It Matters: Targeting von der Leyen underscores Moscow\u2019s escalating shadow war tactics. Russia has already been using jammers against civilian aircraft in the Baltics and Nordic countries. Europe must get serious about confronting Russia\u2019s increasing aggression before it spirals further.Source: CNNRussian Strikes on Western Assets in Ukraine Send an Ominous MessageWhat Happened: Days after Trump met Putin in Alaska, Russia struck an American-owned factory in Mukachevo and EU and British Council offices in Kyiv. At least 25 were murdered by Russia\u2019s genocidal attack, as Moscow deliberately targeted Western assets.Why It Matters: The strikes show Putin\u2019s confidence to hit Western sites while testing U.S. and European resolve. With Trump showing fealty to Russia and limiting his response to saying he\u2019s \u201cnot happy,\u201d Moscow is emboldened.Source: New York TimesHe Plagiarized and Promoted Falsehoods. The White House Embraces Him.What Happened: Benny Johnson, a right-wing podcaster with a history of plagiarism and spreading falsehoods, has been embraced by the Trump White House. Despite police records contradicting his crime stories, he was given a front-row media seat at press briefings and frequent access to top officials, joining a circle of pro-Trump influencers amplified by the regime.Why It Matters: The White House is sidelining real journalists while elevating propagandists who ran Kremlin influence operations. By legitimizing figures like Johnson, Trump is replacing facts with loyalist narratives, turning disinformation into official state messaging.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn News1.2 million immigrants are gone from the US labor force under Trump, preliminary data showsWhat Happened: Since January, 1.2 million immigrants have vanished from the U.S. labor force under Trump\u2019s crackdown. Immigrants make up nearly 20% of workers, including 45% in farming and 43% in home health care. Crops are rotting, construction has suffered, and hospitals face staff shortages.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s claims of targeting criminals, most deportees have no convictions. The purge is tearing families apart and crippling industries that keep America fed, built, and cared for.Source: Associated PressTrump plans a hefty tax on imported drugs, risking higher prices and shortagesWhat Happened: Trump is threatening tariffs of up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals. Even a 25% levy could raise U.S. drug prices by 10\u201314%, analysts warn, once stockpiles run down. While Trump says tariffs will bring factories back to the U.S., critics say they risk shortages and higher costs for consumers, especially low-income families and seniors.Why It Matters: Tariffs on medicine threaten access to affordable generics, raise insurance costs, and destabilize supply chains. Trump is gambling with public health and plans to force Americans to pay more for lifesaving medicines.Source: Associated PressNew $250 visa fee risks deepening US travel slumpWhat Happened: Trump imposed a new $250 \u201cvisa integrity fee\u201d on travelers from non\u2013visa waiver countries like Mexico, Brazil, India, and China, raising the total cost of a U.S. visa to $442 \u2014 among the highest in the world. The move comes as overseas travel to the U.S. has already fallen for five straight months, with visitor spending projected to drop by $12 billion this year.Why It Matters: Experts warn this fee will worsen the travel slump, hurting local economies and jobs just as other countries lure visitors away. Reciprocal fees from foreign governments could spark a wider travel backlash.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/6- Next Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Judge blocks Trump administration from expanding fast-track deportations nationwide, citing due process concernsWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s expansion of expedited removal, which allowed immigration agents to disappear migrants anywhere in the U.S. without a hearing if they had been in the country less than two years. Judge Jia Cobb ruled the policy violated due process rights, pausing a key plank of Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign.Source: CBS NewsChicago mayor signs order with blueprint for fighting a potential Trump crackdownWhat Happened: Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing the city to use \u201cevery legal mechanism\u201d to fight a potential Trump deployment of federal agents or National Guard troops. The order bars Chicago police from aiding federal immigration enforcement or collaborating with military patrols. Johnson warned the city has \u201cdays, not weeks\u201d before possible militarized activity.Source: NBC NewsIn Chicago, thousands protest against threat of ICE, National Guard deploymentWhat Happened: Thousands marched through Chicago on Labor Day to protest Trump\u2019s threats to deploy ICE agents and National Guard troops in the city.
