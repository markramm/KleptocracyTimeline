And over the past chapters, we have returned again and again to Russia\u2019s growing reliance on troll factories \u2014 operations whose fingerprints can be seen in the endless stream of posts, memes, and comments that flood our screens every time we log on to so\u2026Read more2 days ago \u00b7 55 likes \u00b7 2 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsRep. Luna's investment in a donor's energy firm illustrates potential limits of a stock trading banWhat Happened: Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who is advocating a congressional stock trading ban, invested up to $500,000 in a private oil-and-gas firm run by a donor. Her office denies she owns stocks, but ethics experts say the stake poses conflicts since she serves on energy-related committees.Why It Matters: Luna\u2019s case shows how lawmakers can still profit through private equity or \u201csmall business\u201d exemptions in proposed bans. Even reform bills aimed at curbing insider trading risk are weakened by loopholes that leave room for influence and conflicts.Source: NBC NewsHow Trump\u2019s Business Empire Benefits From His PresidencyWhat Happened: Trump continues merging governing with self-enrichment, hosting foreign leaders at his Turnberry resort and opening a new golf course in Aberdeen on a taxpayer-funded trip. His sons are expanding Trump Organization projects abroad with partners tied to foreign governments, while the family cashes in on crypto ventures that surged after being promoted at his properties.Why It Matters: With ethics oversight dismantled and conflict-of-interest rules ignored, Trump has fused presidential power with private profit. Foreign governments and corporations now do business directly with his companies, steering U.S. policy by what enriches him \u2014 the very definition of kleptocracy.Source: BloombergOil Tycoons Bet Big on Trump. It\u2019s Paying Off.What Happened: Trump\u2019s top oil donors, including Harold Hamm and Kelcy Warren, are benefiting as the regime opens wilderness and federal waters to drilling, fast-tracks LNG terminals, scraps EV subsidies, and moves to dismantle climate rules. Industry CEOs now have direct access to Trump, projecting billions in tax breaks from his spending law.Why It Matters: Trump has turned U.S. energy policy into pay-to-play, entrenching fossil fuels while gutting renewables. His oil backers are steering national policy, leaving consumers with higher costs, worsening climate risks, and ceding clean-tech leadership to China \u2014 a textbook case of state capture.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsProject 2026: Trump\u2019s Plan to Rig the Next ElectionWhat Happened: Trump and his allies are pushing a national voter suppression agenda\u2014demanding proof-of-citizenship to register, restricting mail ballots, exploiting uncertified machines, and pressing GOP states to gerrymander mid-decade. At the same time, he\u2019s weaponizing federal power by deploying Guard and agents, gutting CISA and DOJ voting rights enforcement, and floating emergency powers to police the vote.Why It Matters: The plan is designed to tilt the 2026 midterms by choking access, sowing chaos over election systems, and rigging maps and referees. If unchecked, it could normalize federal intimidation at the polls, hollow out Voting Rights Act protections, and open the door to post-election subversion.Source: Mother JonesWhite House Prepares Report Critical of Statistics AgencyWhat Happened: The White House is preparing a report attacking the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump purged its commissioner over a jobs report with steep downward revisions. He accused the agency of \u201cmanipulating\u201d numbers and has nominated extremist and BLS critic E.J. Antoni to take over, raising fears of staff purges and politicized data.Why It Matters: Undermining the BLS converts U.S. economic data into political propaganda. If trust in the numbers collapses, markets will destabilize, borrowing costs spike, and the investments in the U.S. will fall.Source: Wall Street JournalChicago mayor says city \"received no notice\" ahead of Homeland Security's \"Operation Midway Blitz\" announcementWhat Happened: DHS launched \u201cOperation Midway Blitz,\u201d a surge of ICE raids in Chicago, which it claims targets \u201ccriminal illegal aliens.\u201d Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city had \u201cno notice,\u201d while Gov. Pritzker accused Trump of staging a fear campaign; Trump celebrated with militarized Apocalypse Now rhetoric.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing immigration enforcement as political theater, bypassing local authorities and stoking fear in immigrant communities. With ICE\u2019s record of wrongful detentions, the raids risk sweeping up more U.S. citizens and cementing Trump\u2019s police state agenda.Source: CBS News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsRepublicans in Congress are eager for Trump to expand his use of the military on US soilWhat Happened: Trump is deploying National Guard troops to occupy U.S. cities, using the military to advance his domestic agenda. Republicans in Congress are backing him, urging further deployments to cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans.Why It Matters: Congress was meant to act as a check, but instead it has become a rubber stamp for Trump\u2019s extremist and illegal agenda. This unprecedented push to turn the U.S. military into a national police force under presidential command normalizes military rule over civilian life and shreds constitutional limits.Source: Associated PressSupreme Court lifts restrictions on LA immigration stops set after agents swept up US citizensWhat Happened: The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority lifted limits on immigration stops in Los Angeles, letting ICE resume roving patrols that had previously swept up U.S. citizens. The ruling overturned a lower-court order that barred stops based only on race, language, job, or location.Why It Matters: The decision gives Trump\u2019s deportation machine a green light to target millions of Latinos in LA, including U.S. citizens, under the guise of enforcement. By allowing racial profiling on steroids, the Court is stripping constitutional protections and accelerating Trump\u2019s mass-deportation agenda.Source: Associated PressChief justice lets Trump remove member of Federal Trade Commission for nowWhat Happened: Chief Justice John Roberts allowed Trump to purge FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, despite legal protections against arbitrary firings of independent agency members. The order, issued through the Court\u2019s emergency docket, follows Trump\u2019s removals of other regulators across independent boards.Why It Matters: The decision guts the independence of federal watchdogs, overturning nearly 90 years of precedent insulating regulators from presidential control. By granting Trump unchecked firing power, the Supreme Court is enabling his dismantling of consumer protection and antitrust oversight \u2014 and continuing to hand him king-like powers.Source: Associated PressLocal Sheriffs Are Turning Their Jails Into ICE Detention CentersWhat Happened: County sheriffs nationwide are striking deals with ICE to house immigrants in local jails, with Butler County, Ohio, devoting nearly half its 860 beds. ICE\u2019s reliance on jails has doubled under Trump, now holding about 7,100 detainees daily \u2014 many without criminal charges \u2014 as sheriffs tout the contracts as \u201cpatriotic\u201d and profitable.Why It Matters: Converting county jails into ICE detention hubs accelerates Trump\u2019s mass deportation operations while raising alarms over abuse, poor medical care, and blocked legal access. Civil detention is being run like criminal incarceration.Source: New York TimesBrendan Carr Channeling Trump\u2019s Showman Instincts to Overhaul FCCWhat Happened: FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist, is using the commission to pressure broadcasters while echoing Trump\u2019s attacks on mainstream outlets. He\u2019s threatened to pull Comcast\u2019s license over NBC coverage, tied merger approvals to pro-Trump settlements, and backed rules boosting conservative.Why It Matters: Trump has hijacked another agency and installed a loyalist to enforce his agenda. The FCC was meant to be independent, but Carr is openly carrying out Trump\u2019s agenda, turning regulatory power into political loyalty, and weaponizing broadcast licenses against critical media. Source: Wall Street JournalSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump's former Japan ambassador nominee appointed CBS News ombudsmanWhat Happened: Kenneth Weinstein, a Hudson Institute conservative and former Trump ambassador nominee, was named CBS News ombudsman after Paramount\u2019s merger with Skydance. The post was created under regulatory pressure following Trump\u2019s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, which settled for $16 million.Why It Matters: Installing a Trump ally as CBS\u2019s bias watchdog guts the network\u2019s editorial independence. Trump continues using lawsuits, settlements, and mergers to intimidate and take control of the media and its coverage.Source: ReutersTrump says Department of Education will issue guidance about prayer in public schoolsWhat Happened: At the Bible Museum, Trump announced new Department of Education guidance to \u201cprotect\u201d prayer in public schools, casting it as a fight against anti-religious indoctrination. He tied it to school choice, opposition to transgender students in sports, and a call to \u201cbring back religion in America,\u201d while also hawking his Made-in-China Bible.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to advance Christian nationalist priorities, eroding church-state separation. By elevating school prayer as policy\u2014and monetizing it with his Bible sales\u2014he\u2019s undermining constitutional safeguards and reshaping education to enforce religious conformity.Source: CBS NewsPolice dismantle longstanding White House peace vigil on Trump\u2019s ordersWhat Happened: Police dismantled the anti-nuclear vigil that had stood outside the White House for 44 years, after Trump ordered its removal when asked about it by a conservative TV correspondent. Volunteers were detained as officers tore down the tent, though activists vowed to rebuild and fight in court.Why It Matters: The vigil was the nation\u2019s longest continuous anti-war protest, a symbol of free speech and dissent in front of the seat of power. Its destruction underscores Trump\u2019s crackdown on visible opposition and raises new constitutional questions about his federal control of Washington, D.C.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsArrested by Federal Agents, Some D.C. Residents Languished in Jail for DaysWhat Happened: At least 11 D.C. residents arrested in Trump\u2019s federal crime crackdown were jailed beyond the 48-hour legal limit before seeing a judge. Court records show people facing minor charges spent days in poor conditions as prosecutors under Jeanine Pirro repeatedly missed deadlines, prompting judges to call the delays unconstitutional.Why It Matters: The prolonged detentions show how Trump\u2019s takeover of D.C. policing is eroding due process and constitutional rights. Legal experts warn it sets a dangerous precedent: presumed-innocent people left to languish in cells for political theater.Source: New York TimesTransgender Military Kids Face 'Profound Harm' from Health Care Restrictions, Lawsuit AllegesWhat Happened: Military families with transgender children filed a lawsuit against the Pentagon, arguing Trump\u2019s executive order and defense policies unlawfully cut off gender-affirming care for dependents. Families say prescriptions were halted without notice, doctors forced to abandon patients, and costs pushed onto parents.Why It Matters: The crackdown goes beyond the law Congress passed, targeting not just minors but all military dependents. Families of service members now face devastating health consequences and financial strain, while Trump accelerates his broader campaign to erase transgender people from public life.Source: Military.comA Houston mother held by ICE must choose: indefinite detention or be deported without her familyWhat Happened: ICE detained Margarita Avila, a Houston mother of nine, after an altercation that resulted in no charges, leaving her facing indefinite detention or deportation to Belize without her family. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of targeting \u201cthe worst of the worst,\u201d 70% of detainees this year have no criminal record.Why It Matters: Avila\u2019s case shows the human toll of Trump\u2019s mass deportation drive, ripping apart families who have lived and worked in the U.S. for decades. It underscores that ordinary immigrants\u2014not violent criminals\u2014are the ones most often swept up in this crackdown.Source: Texas TribuneThe Untold Saga of What Happened When DOGE Stormed Social SecurityWhat Happened: ProPublica reports unauthorized DOGE stormed the Social Security Administration in search of flashy \u201cfraud\u201d wins while neglecting modernization. Acting commissioner Leland Dudek described chaos, staff departures, and policy zigzags, with unvetted DOGE operatives still entrenched under Commissioner Frank Bisignano.Why It Matters: DOGE sowed confusion, drained expertise, and compromised security\u2014stealing and uploading the data of every American onto an unsecured server. The result is a destabilized agency vital to millions.Source: ProPublicaStates Heading Toward Constitutional Showdown Over Abortion Shield LawsWhat Happened: Texas AG Ken Paxton is suing in New York to enforce a judgment against a doctor who mailed abortion pills to Texas, directly challenging New York\u2019s shield law. AG Letitia James says she\u2019ll defend the law, setting up a likely Supreme Court showdown.Why It Matters: The case tests whether states must honor each other\u2019s abortion bans under the Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit Clause. The outcome could decide if blue-state shield laws can continue protecting providers who serve patients in ban states.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchA Military Approach to Drug Busts Upends US Efforts and Raises Legal QuestionsWhat Happened: Trump launched a military strike on a suspected \u201cdrug-smuggling\u201d vessel off Venezuela, killing 11 alleged cartel members, and signaled more such operations to come. Officials framed it as self-defense, but legal experts warned the strike had no authorization under U.S. or international law.Why It Matters: By replacing arrests and prosecutions with extrajudicial killings, Trump is dismantling decades of legal frameworks. Trump seems to be escalating to start a war against Venezuela.Source: Military.comNIH whistleblower details clash over childhood vaccines with Trump administration: \"We became inconvenient\"What Happened: Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, former head of NIH\u2019s infectious disease institute, filed a whistleblower complaint saying she was silenced and retaliated against for resisting RFK Jr.\u2019s request to cancel vaccine research and trials. She alleges leadership echoed Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine propaganda and shut down projects for political reasons.Why It Matters: RFK Jr. is weaponizing health agencies to drive an extremist anti-vaccine agenda, dismantling research and punishing dissenting scientists. Experts warn this creates a \u201csubstantial danger to public health,\u201d leaving Americans at risk of outbreaks.Source: CBS NewsAs Ebola outbreak kills 16 people in Congo, WHO official says Trump's aid cuts \"will definitely have an impact\"What Happened: An Ebola outbreak in Congo\u2019s Kasai Province has killed 16 people, with 28 suspected cases, including health workers. WHO says Congo has just 2,000 vaccine doses on hand and needs more, but Trump\u2019s cuts to global health programs are hindering the response.Why It Matters: This is Congo\u2019s sixth Ebola outbreak in seven years, but now U.S. support has been slashed. Trump\u2019s cuts weaken frontline containment efforts, raising the risk of wider spread and undermining global health security.Source: CBS NewsTrump Shares Video Promoting Discredited Link of Vaccines to AutismWhat Happened: Trump shared an old video on Truth Social featuring Mark and David Geier, discredited figures who pushed false vaccine-autism \u201cstudies.\u201d David Geier, once accused of practicing medicine without a license, now works in HHS under RFK Jr. on an autism study.Why It Matters: By amplifying debunked lies, Trump legitimizes anti-vaccine conspiracy theories at the highest levels of government. This subordinates science to politics, fueling fears of lower vaccination rates and preventable disease outbreaks.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Threatens to Punch Housing Official in the FaceWhat Happened: At a Georgetown club dinner, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent threatened to \u201cbeat up\u201d FHFA Director Bill Pulte after accusing him of trashing him to Trump, until others intervened. Why It Matters: The episode shows the chaos and infighting consuming Trump\u2019s top advisers, where grudges and loyalty tests overshadow governance. With markets already rattled by Trump\u2019s war on the Fed, senior officials trading threats highlights the sheer insanity of this regime.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHegseth in Puerto Rico as Pentagon eyes island for military usageWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine made a surprise trip to Puerto Rico as the Pentagon considers basing jets and warships there for expanded \u201canti-cartel\u201d operations. The visit comes after Trump ordered a strike that killed 11 alleged Venezuelan traffickers, with no evidence provided, as eight U.S. warships already patrol the Caribbean.Why It Matters: Puerto Rico may become the staging ground for Trump\u2019s military operations, blurring the line between policing and warfare. It feels like a cover for potential operations against Venezuela while bypassing Congress.Source: Washington PostCzech Republic and allies break up Belarus spy network across EuropeWhat Happened: Czech intelligence, with Hungary and Romania, exposed a Belarusian KGB spy network active across Europe. A former Moldovan intelligence officer was arrested for leaking classified data, and a Belarusian agent posing as a diplomat was expelled from Prague.Why It Matters: The case highlights how Russia, through its proxy Belarus, is expanding espionage in Europe. It underscores the threat of Belarusian and Russian diplomats exploiting Schengen access for hostile intelligence operations.Source: ABC NewsThe U.S. is a major importer of Indian products made from Russian oilWhat Happened: The U.S. has bought $1.4 billion in oil products from India this year, largely from Reliance\u2019s Jamnagar refinery, which sources nearly half its crude from Russia. At the same time, Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50%, accusing New Delhi of funding Putin\u2019s war machine.Why It Matters: Washington is punishing India while still consuming Russian-linked fuel, underscoring contradictions in Trump\u2019s tariff crusade. The move risks damaging U.S.\u2013India ties, raising consumer prices, and weakening global unity against Moscow.Source: NPRU.S. and European officials meet to discuss new sanctions on RussiaWhat Happened: U.S. and European officials met at the Treasury Department to weigh new sanctions and tariffs on Russian oil, along with the fate of Moscow\u2019s frozen sovereign assets. The talks followed Trump\u2019s August deadline for Russia to end its invasion and his push for a Putin\u2013Zelenskyy meeting.Why It Matters: The meeting signals mounting pressure for tougher action, but Trump\u2019s mix of tariff \u201cthreats\u201d and continued fealty to Moscow is dividing allies.Source: NBC NewsIran Runs Risk of More Military Attacks, Nuclear Watchdog WarnsWhat Happened: IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned Iran risks renewed military strikes unless it allows inspectors back into its nuclear program. Since Israeli and U.S. attacks in June destroyed much of its above-ground infrastructure, inspectors have lost track of near-weapons-grade uranium, though Grossi said a preliminary deal could come \u201cwithin days or hours.\u201dWhy It Matters: For the first time since 2006, there is no verified accounting of Iran\u2019s nuclear material, heightening fears of hidden enrichment and further strikes. Any delay in restoring inspections risks escalating tensions, while even a deal would leave major verification challenges.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchEstonia summons top Russian diplomat after helicopter violates Estonian airspaceWhat Happened: Estonia summoned Russia\u2019s top diplomat after a Russian Mi-8 helicopter entered its airspace near Vaindloo Island without a transponder or flight plan. It was the third such violation in 2025, part of a broader pattern of Moscow\u2019s aerial provocations in the Baltic region.Why It Matters: These repeated incursions heighten the risk of confrontation between Russia and NATO. With sabotage and spy operations already escalating in the Baltics, each violation further destabilizes regional security and tests the alliance\u2019s resolve \u2014 while Russia is also probing NATO\u2019s response time.Source: Kyiv IndependentNATO\u2019s eastern flank braces for Russia\u2019s war gamesWhat Happened: Russia and Belarus will hold Zapad 2025 war games on Sept. 12\u201316 near Poland and Lithuania. NATO allies are running parallel drills \u2014 Poland\u2019s Iron Defender-25 with 30,000 troops, Lithuania\u2019s Thunder Strike, and Tarassis 25 with 10 Northern European nations \u2014 as experts warn Moscow\u2019s declared 13,000 troops hide a much larger mobilization, including nuclear planning and CSTO exercises.Why It Matters: NATO fears Zapad could preview Russia\u2019s next offensive even as the Ukraine war grinds on. The drills coincide with Trump\u2019s push to cut U.S. security aid to Eastern Europe, fueling frontline allies\u2019 anxiety that Moscow may test NATO\u2019s resolve \u2014 and use the exercises as cover to shift troops and military equipment.Source: PoliticoUS Ends International Push to Combat Fake News from Hostile StatesWhat Happened: Trump withdrew from agreements with European allies to jointly counter disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran. The State Department ended memoranda of understanding signed under Biden, dismantling the Global Engagement Center\u2019s international framework and framing the move as protecting \u201cfree speech.\u201dWhy It Matters: The step removes the last U.S.\u2013Europe defenses against foreign propaganda just as Russia, Iran, and China intensify their operations. Without shared resistance, allies are more vulnerable in elections, media, and public opinion\u2014weakening the Western front against authoritarian operations. Another gift from Trump to Russia.Source: Financial TimesA once-fringe Christian leader gets a warm welcome in Trump\u2019s WashingtonWhat Happened: Doug Wilson, a pastor once known for fringe patriarchal and racist teachings, is now embraced in Trump\u2019s Washington. He preached at a new church near Capitol Hill and appeared with Cabinet officials, promoting Christian nationalism and opposing women\u2019s rights, same-sex marriage, and immigration.Why It Matters: Wilson\u2019s rise shows how extremist theology once dismissed as fringe has gained legitimacy under Trump. His patriarchal, authoritarian vision is no longer marginal but is being woven into the political and cultural fabric of Trump\u2019s America.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsMajor jobs revision Tuesday could show the labor market is weaker than previously thoughtWhat Happened: Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to cut its job growth estimate by about 800,000 for the year through March 2025, showing hiring was much weaker than first reported. Trump, who already purged the BLS commissioner, has attacked the agency\u2019s credibility and nominated a Heritage fellow who vowed to take a \u201cchainsaw\u201d to it.Why It Matters: The revision highlights a stalling labor market as tariffs and AI-driven cuts hit employers. By politicizing the BLS, Trump erodes trust in federal data just as the Fed considers key rate cuts to stabilize the economy.Source: CBS NewsLumber Prices Are Flashing a Warning Sign for the U.S. EconomyWhat Happened: Lumber futures have dropped 24% since early August to $526 per thousand board feet as housing demand weakens and Trump\u2019s tariff threats on Canadian imports shake the market. Mills in the U.S. and Canada are cutting output, idling plants, and reducing shifts to manage oversupply.Why It Matters: Lumber is a key economic indicator, and its plunge points to a broader slowdown in housing and construction. Trump\u2019s tariff chaos has deepened the slump, raising fears it could spread through the economy and edge the U.S. toward recession.Source: Wall Street JournalAmericans' confidence in finding a new job falls to record lowWhat Happened: A New York Fed survey found Americans\u2019 confidence in finding new work after job loss has fallen to 44.9%\u2014the lowest since 2013. Expectations of rising unemployment hit 39.1% as August saw just 22,000 jobs added, and joblessness rose to 4.3%.Why It Matters: The plunge in worker confidence shows the labor market stalling under Trump\u2019s economic policies. With hiring flat and layoffs looming, the Fed faces pressure to cut rates, but public pessimism points to deepening distress.Source: CBS NewsBillionaire CEO who voted for Trump sounds the alarm on Fed attacksWhat Happened: Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, a Trump supporter, co-wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed warning that Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve threaten its independence. He cautioned that political pressure to cut rates could spark inflation and higher borrowing costs, echoing the 1970s stagflation crisis.Why It Matters: Griffin\u2019s public rebuke is rare among CEOs who typically avoid criticizing Trump. His warning highlights fears that Trump\u2019s bid to bend the Fed could erode U.S. credibility, wipe out retirees\u2019 savings, and destabilize the economy.Source: CNN\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News10/18- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Appeals court upholds E. Jean Carroll\u2019s $83.3M defamation judgment against TrumpWhat Happened: A federal appeals court upheld the $83.3 million defamation award against Trump for viciously attacking writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. Judges called Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented,\u201d citing the wave of death threats Carroll endured.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers10/18 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action$500,000 \u2014 Max investment Rep.

Prices are rising, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Trump\u2019s Erratic Tariffs \u2014 Tariff whiplash and AI-driven cuts are chilling hiring and construction; markets now expect imminent Fed easing as confidence sinks.State Capture, Plain and Simple \u2014 Energy donors and the Trump Org are reaping policy and profit: drilling fast-tracked, EV/renewables hobbled, and foreign partners courted while ethics guardrails are dismantled.Institutional Neutrality Is Being Gutted \u2014 From BLS to the FCC and FTC, independent officials are being intimidated or purged, turning public data and regulation into partisan weapons.Deportation State Expands \u2014 ICE is scaling up via county jails and loosening stop rules; due-process breaches in D.C. show how quickly rights erode under \u201ctough on crime\u201d theatrics.Info Ops: Unilateral Disarmament \u2014 By walking away from allied anti-disinfo pacts, the U.S. is intentionally inviting Russian, Chinese, and Iranian influence operations just as key elections and decisions loom.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs. Share credible information with journalists, watchdogs, and legal experts. Silence enables authoritarianism\u2014see something, say something.Defend Press Freedom: Support independent journalism by subscribing to and sharing reporting that challenges Trump\u2019s power grab.Contact Lawmakers: Demand accountability for Trump and Musk\u2019s unchecked power and Trump\u2019s war on oversight.Protest: Join local and national demonstrations against Trump\u2019s authoritarian overreach, purges, and attacks on civil rights.Attend Town Halls: Confront lawmakers and demand answers about government purges, deregulation, and threats to constitutional rights.Stay Vigilant: Watch for court rulings, executive overreach, and attempts to rewrite the Constitution.

Luna's investment in a donor's energy firm illustrates potential limits of a stock trading ban</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who is advocating a congressional stock trading ban, invested up to $500,000 in a private oil-and-gas firm run by a donor. Her office denies she owns stocks, but ethics experts say the stake poses conflicts since she serves on energy-related committees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Luna\\u2019s case shows how lawmakers can still profit through private equity or \\u201Csmall business\\u201D exemptions in proposed bans. Even reform bills aimed at curbing insider trading risk are weakened by loopholes that leave room for influence and conflicts.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/anna-paulina-luna-investment-energy-firm-stock-trading-ban-rcna229289\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>How Trump\\u2019s Business Empire Benefits From His Presidency</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump continues merging governing with self-enrichment, hosting foreign leaders at his Turnberry resort and opening a new golf course in Aberdeen on a taxpayer-funded trip. His sons are expanding Trump Organization projects abroad with partners tied to foreign governments, while the family cashes in on crypto ventures that surged after being promoted at his properties.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With ethics oversight dismantled and conflict-of-interest rules ignored, Trump has fused presidential power with private profit. Foreign governments and corporations now do business directly with his companies, steering U.S. policy by what enriches him \\u2014 the very definition of kleptocracy.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/how-trump-s-business-empire-benefits-from-his-presidency?srnd=phx-us-politics\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Oil Tycoons Bet Big on Trump. It\\u2019s Paying Off.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s top oil donors, including Harold Hamm and Kelcy Warren, are benefiting as the regime opens wilderness and federal waters to drilling, fast-tracks LNG terminals, scraps EV subsidies, and moves to dismantle climate rules. Industry CEOs now have direct access to Trump, projecting billions in tax breaks from his spending law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has turned U.S. energy policy into pay-to-play, entrenching fossil fuels while gutting renewables. His oil backers are steering national policy, leaving consumers with higher costs, worsening climate risks, and ceding clean-tech leadership to China \\u2014 a textbook case of state capture.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-oil-industry-executives-policies-85eb74e6?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos3\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Project 2026: Trump\\u2019s Plan to Rig the Next Election</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump and his allies are pushing a national voter suppression agenda\\u2014demanding proof-of-citizenship to register, restricting mail ballots, exploiting uncertified machines, and pressing GOP states to gerrymander mid-decade. At the same time, he\\u2019s weaponizing federal power by deploying Guard and agents, gutting CISA and DOJ voting rights enforcement, and floating emergency powers to police the vote.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The plan is designed to tilt the 2026 midterms by choking access, sowing chaos over election systems, and rigging maps and referees. If unchecked, it could normalize federal intimidation at the polls, hollow out Voting Rights Act protections, and open the door to post-election subversion.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/donald-trump-plan-to-rig-2026-midterm-elections-voter-suppression-gerrymandering-certification/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>White House Prepares Report Critical of Statistics Agency</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The White House is preparing a report attacking the Bureau of Labor Statistics after Trump purged its commissioner over a jobs report with steep downward revisions. He accused the agency of \\u201Cmanipulating\\u201D numbers and has nominated extremist and BLS critic E.J. Antoni to take over, raising fears of staff purges and politicized data.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Undermining the BLS converts U.S. economic data into political propaganda.
