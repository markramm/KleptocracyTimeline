Puskar/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 27Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: Zoom Zoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET.

Its aim: to sow discord, promote Donald Trump, and damage Hillary Clinton\u2026Read more7 days ago \u00b7 83 likes \u00b7 8 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsSilicon Valley Pledges $200 Million to New Pro-A.I. Super PACsWhat Happened: Meta, Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, and others pledged up to $200 million to two new super PACs\u2014Meta California and Leading the Future\u2014focused on defeating politicians seen as hostile to AI in key state and federal races.Why It Matters: Big Tech is moving beyond lobbying into outright electioneering. With Trump\u2019s backing, Silicon Valley is pouring money into politics to lock in pro-AI policies, sidelining democratic checks on a technology with massive societal risks.Source: New York TimesTrump and Advisers, Including Kushner, Meet on Gaza\u2019s FutureWhat Happened: Trump convened an Oval Office meeting with Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio, and former UK PM Tony Blair to discuss Gaza\u2019s future. Trump floated expelling Palestinian residents and redeveloping the strip into a luxury resort, even as cease-fire talks with Hamas remain frozen.Why It Matters: Kushner is back shaping Middle East policy with his own business interests in mind. Trump and Kushner have previously floated illegally removing Palestinians to turn Gaza into waterfront condos\u2014banned under international law\u2014raising fears this meeting could advance a plan to turn this horrific war into a real estate deal.Source: New York TimesThe Leader of Trump\u2019s Assault on Higher Education Has a Troubled Legal and Financial HistoryWhat Happened: Leo Terrell, a former Democrat turned Fox News pundit, now heads Trump\u2019s \u201cantisemitism\u201d task force. His office has threatened massive lawsuits and frozen billions in funding, forcing schools like Columbia and Brown into settlements\u2014even as his own record is marred by malpractice suits, tax debts, and judicial rebukes.Why It Matters: Terrell\u2019s job isn\u2019t to protect Jewish students but to pursue Trump\u2019s war on education. By weaponizing civil rights law, he\u2019s dismantling diversity programs, crippling research, and turning academic freedom into a MAGA loyalty test.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsThe Magic Phrase Behind Donald Trump\u2019s Power GrabWhat Happened: A WIRED analysis shows Trump\u2019s regime using the president\u2019s \u201cpriorities\u201d as blanket justification for sweeping actions, even when they clash with law or constitutional limits. From agency orders to federal crackdowns, the phrase has become a magic pass to bypass Congress and the courts.Why It Matters: Substituting personal whims for legal authority, Trump is recasting the presidency as an elected monarchy. His \u201cpriorities\u201d mantra erodes constitutional order, normalizing rule by decree over rule of law.Source: WIREDCalifornia Republicans propose \u2018two-state solution\u2019 to counter redistricting pushWhat Happened: California Republicans, led by Assembly GOP leader James Gallagher, introduced a resolution to split the state in two\u2014separating the rural inland from the Democratic coast. The move comes in response to Democrats\u2019 redistricting plan to add five new House seats after Trump\u2019s Texas gerrymander.Why It Matters: The proposal is dead on arrival, but it shows how Trump\u2019s Texas map sparked a redistricting race. Source: Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJohn Bolton Inquiry Eyes Emails Obtained by Foreign GovernmentWhat Happened: Federal investigators are probing whether John Bolton \u201cmishandled\u201d classified material after a foreign intelligence service intercepted his private emails. The communications, sent while he was Trump\u2019s national security adviser, allegedly contained sensitive information later tied to his memoir.Why It Matters: The case underscores how the DOJ is running a sham investigation that may be propped up by Russian \u201cevidence.\u201d It shows the danger of foreign intercepts being laundered through DOJ, turning national security tools into weapons against political critics.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Pick to Help Run the FBI Has a History of Prosecuting Influential DemocratsWhat Happened: Trump named Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co\u2013deputy director of the FBI alongside Dan Bongino. Bailey built his MAGA profile by prosecuting Democrats like St. Louis County Executive Sam Page on charges widely seen as legally baseless, showing a pattern of weaponizing the law against rivals.Why It Matters: Bailey\u2019s appointment reiterates Trump\u2019s intent to use the FBI as a weapon against opposition. With loyalists installed, the bureau is being repurposed for political retribution\u2014targeting Democrats while shielding Trump\u2019s allies.Source: ProPublicaUS Justice Dept investigating California's environmental agencyWhat Happened: The Justice Department opened an investigation into California\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency, examining whether its employment practices \u201cdiscriminate\u201d on the basis of race, sex, color, or national origin. DOJ announced the probe in a public statement but gave no timeline or specific allegations.Why It Matters: The move extends Trump\u2019s pattern of targeting blue states and their agencies by twisting civil rights law into another tool against opposition. Framed as \u201canti-discrimination,\u201d it\u2019s really an effort to gut California\u2019s regulatory power and punish its progressive policies.Source: ReutersTrump calls for racketeering charges against top Democratic donor, sonWhat Happened: Trump demanded federal racketeering charges against Democratic donor George Soros and his son Alex, accusing them\u2014without evidence\u2014of backing violent protests. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations called the claim \u201coutrageous and false,\u201d while DOJ declined to comment.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing RICO to smear political opponents, escalating his retribution campaign against critics and donors. By targeting Soros, a longtime Russia and GOP boogeyman, he\u2019s turning federal law into a political weapon.Source: Washington PostProsecutors Fail to Obtain Indictment Against Man Who Threw Sandwich at Federal AgentWhat Happened: A grand jury refused to indict Sean C. Dunn, a former DOJ paralegal, on felony assault charges after he threw a sandwich at a federal agent deployed in Washington. The case, hyped by the regime, joins a string of failed prosecutions against protesters arrested by militarized federal forces.Why It Matters: The collapse of these cases highlights the baseless legal basis behind these charges. By pushing minor confrontations into federal court, the regime is overreaching, undermining civil liberties, and exposing the weakness of its insane agenda.Source: New York TimesTulsi Gabbard Blindsided CIA Over Revoking Clearance of Undercover OfficerWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 officials tied to the Russia probe and Trump\u2019s impeachment, even exposing a covert CIA officer. She bypassed agency consultation, alarming officials who warned the disclosure jeopardized CIA cover procedures and foreign relations, saying she acted on Trump\u2019s orders to purge \u201cpoliticized\u201d intelligence.Why It Matters: Gabbard\u2019s move shows Trump\u2019s allies weaponizing intelligence to punish critics, even if it blows the cover of CIA officers\u2014something Moscow will welcome. This undermines U.S. operations, endangers assets, and deepens the politicization of national security in service of Trump\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: Wall Street JournalFEMA employees who signed letter Monday critical of admin placed on leaveWhat Happened: 36 FEMA employees who signed a letter to Congress warning that Trump\u2019s unqualified appointees and policy changes could cripple disaster response have been put on administrative leave. The move came after their warning that the agency was straying from post-Katrina reforms meant to prevent deadly failures.Why It Matters: More retaliation against whistleblowers. By sidelining career disaster experts, Trump continues undermining FEMA\u2019s readiness at the height of hurricane season\u2014leaving American lives in danger as he silencea dissent and enforces loyalty.Source: ABC NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFlock Wants to Partner With Consumer Dashcam Company That Takes \u2018Trillions of Images\u2019 a MonthWhat Happened: Flock, the surveillance company already giving DHS and ICE access to its license plate reader network, is exploring a partnership with Nexar, a dashcam company that captures \u201ctrillions of images\u201d a month. The deal would turn millions of private cars into roaming surveillance devices, massively expanding the data fed to law enforcement.Why It Matters: This would supercharge the surveillance state\u2014turning drivers into unwitting data collectors for ICE, DHS, and police. By merging corporate tech with federal power, it blurs the line between personal devices and state spying, normalizing mass monitoring of Americans.Source: 404 MediaJudge questions if Spanish-language journalist can stay in immigration detention without chargesWhat Happened: A federal judge in Georgia questioned why ICE is still holding Mario Guevara, a Spanish-language journalist from El Salvador, after all charges against him were dropped. Guevara was arrested while covering a June protest near Atlanta and remains detained despite an immigration judge granting him bond.Why It Matters: Advocates say Guevara is being silenced for reporting on ICE and filming police, raising First Amendment and due process concerns. His case shows how immigration detention can be weaponized against journalists exposing government abuses.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsImmigration advocates alarmed over detention of Daca recipient: \u2018No legal basis\u2019What Happened: Border Patrol arrested Catalina \u201cXochitl\u201d Santiago, a 28-year-old DACA recipient and activist, at El Paso airport despite her legal protections. Officials cited alleged charges without convictions, part of a broader pattern of Dreamers being detained.Why It Matters: DHS is targeting Dreamers in defiance of existing protections, leaving hundreds of thousands vulnerable to detention and deportation. Advocates warn that this guts what little security DACA offered.Source: GuardianSenate Probe Uncovers Allegations of Widespread Abuse in ICE CustodyWhat Happened: A Senate investigation led by Sen. Jon Ossoff uncovered more than 500 credible reports of abuse in ICE custody since January, including miscarriages, child neglect, and sexual assault. The probe spans 25 states, Puerto Rico, and military bases, exposing systemic mistreatment of pregnant women and children.Why It Matters: As Trump doubles ICE\u2019s detention capacity, reports show a system rife with cruelty, abuses, and human rights violations \u2014 where women bleed unattended, sick children are ignored, and detainees are hidden in remote camps. The expansion locks in the largest immigration detention network in U.S. history, designed to hide these abuses.Source: WIREDRwanda says 7 deportees arrived from the U.S. in August under agreement with WashingtonWhat Happened: Rwanda confirmed that seven migrants disappeared from the U.S. arrived in mid-August under a new Trump deal. Rwanda has agreed to take up to 250 deportees, joining Uganda, Eswatini, and South Sudan in secretive U.S. relocation agreements.Why It Matters: These disturbing arrangements outsource America\u2019s disappearance system to authoritarian regimes, putting lives at risk. Deportees face indefinite detention or exile in countries they don\u2019t know, turning U.S. policy into a human rights nightmare.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchCDC erupts in chaos after ousted chief Susan Monarez refuses to resignWhat Happened: Trump officials purged CDC Director Susan Monarez\u2014confirmed only weeks ago\u2014after she resisted RFK Jr.\u2019s push to roll back vaccine policies. Monarez says she never resigned and was targeted for refusing to endorse \u201cunscientific, reckless directives,\u201d while at least 3 senior CDC leaders quit in protest.Why It Matters: The purge has gutted leadership at America\u2019s top health agency, crippling its crisis response capacity. By sidelining science for ideology, Trump and RFK Jr. are leaving the country dangerously exposed to future health threats.Source: GuardianF.D.A. Approves Covid Shots With New RestrictionsWhat Happened: The FDA approved updated Covid vaccines but restricted them to seniors and high-risk groups\u2014the tightest limits since vaccines began. The move reflects RFK Jr.\u2019s anti-mRNA stance, reinforced by his overhaul of the CDC\u2019s vaccine panel with conspiracy theorists.Why It Matters: This is a major rollback of public health protections, leaving millions without updated shots ahead of flu and Covid season. Kennedy is steering policy toward anti-vaccine ideology, overriding science and risking preventable illness and death.Source: New York TimesNational Guard troops deployed in D.C. add sanitation, landscaping dutiesWhat Happened: More than 2,200 National Guard troops deployed under Trump\u2019s \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in Washington are now assigned to landscaping and trash removal around federal sites. With Park Service staff gutted by Trump\u2019s cuts, soldiers are filling the gap, spreading mulch, cleaning bathrooms, and collecting garbage.Why It Matters: The Guard, trained for war and emergencies, is being diverted into janitorial work to prop up Trump\u2019s federal takeover of D.C. This blurs military roles, drains readiness, and turns troops into props in Trump\u2019s campaign to display control.Source: Washington PostColleges see significant drop in international students as fall semester beginsWhat Happened: Universities nationwide are reporting sharp drops in international student enrollment this fall, with declines up to 15% at schools like the University at Buffalo. Visa delays and mass revocations under Trump have left thousands unable to arrive, forcing many to defer or choose schools in the U.K. or South Korea.Why It Matters: International students contribute $43 billion to the U.S. economy and support over 60,000 jobs. Their decline threatens campus diversity, financial stability, and America\u2019s innovation pipeline, as Trump\u2019s policy whiplash drives talent to competitors abroad.Source: NPRTrump Shrank Staffing of National Parks. See How Many Are Struggling.What Happened: The National Park Service has lost nearly a quarter of its workforce since Trump took office, with over 1,800 employees forced out under resignation initiatives. At least 90 parks report problems ranging from shuttered programs and uncollected fees to canceled events, as Trump orders parks to stay open despite the cuts.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s assault on the park system is draining revenue, eroding safety, and gutting America\u2019s parks. By slashing staff and services, his regime is putting the nation\u2019s \u201cbest idea\u201d at risk of permanent ruin.Source: New York TimesDrowning prevention program comes to a halt at the CDCWhat Happened: Trump officials terminated the CDC\u2019s drowning prevention team and proposed eliminating the program from the 2026 budget. The unit, with just three scientists and a $2 million budget, had partnered with groups like the YMCA to collect national drowning data and fund swim lessons for at-risk kids, including autistic children who face dramatically higher drowning risks.Why It Matters: Drowning kills more than 4,000 Americans annually and is the leading cause of death for young children. By cutting this program, the regime is abandoning low-cost, lifesaving prevention work \u2014 leaving families, small towns, and nonprofits without federal support.Source: NPRSoaring Power Bills in Largest US Grid Pose Risk for RepublicansWhat Happened: Electricity costs on the nation\u2019s largest grid\u2014spanning 13 states from Virginia to Illinois\u2014have hit record highs two years in a row. Trump blames \u201crenewables,\u201d but most power comes from gas, coal, and nuclear, while his rollback of clean-energy projects and grid upgrades has worsened the strain.Why It Matters: Skyrocketing bills are hitting voters in swing states, turning energy into a political liability for Republicans. Trump promised lower costs but delivered higher rates.Source: Bloomberg News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchDenmark Summons U.S. Envoy Over Reported \u2018Influence Operation\u2019 in GreenlandWhat Happened: Denmark summoned the U.S. envoy in Copenhagen after reports that 3 Americans tied to Trump were running covert influence operations in Greenland. The alleged effort involved recruiting locals into a secessionist movement and cultivating politicians to weaken ties with Denmark and tilt the island toward Washington.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s long-running push to illegally annex Greenland is now spilling into covert meddling that threatens U.S.-Danish relations. Trump is acting like Putin\u2014using shady associates to run covert ops against a NATO ally. These efforts risk rupturing U.S.-NATO ties and further undermining Western unity.Source: New York Times and Bloomberg NewsChina rules out participating in denuclearization talks with U.S. and Russia, as suggested by TrumpWhat Happened: China ruled out joining U.S.\u2013Russia nuclear disarmament talks after Trump claimed Beijing would \u201cbe willing\u201d to participate. Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry called the idea \u201cneither reasonable nor realistic,\u201d pointing out that the U.S. and Russia hold nearly 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear arsenal compared to China\u2019s 500 warheads.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s boast of pulling China into arms control collapsed instantly, exposing his weak grasp of nuclear diplomacy. Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchZelenskyy Ousts US Ambassador Under Trump PressureWhat Happened: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy replaced Ambassador Oksana Markarova with Olha Stefanishyna, nearly a year after Trump officials demanded her removal. Source: Bloomberg News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsU.S. tariffs take effect on India, threatening $48.2B in exportsWhat Happened: Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods, putting $48.2 billion in exports at risk. The duties hit labor-heavy sectors like textiles, jewelry, leather, food, and autos, with exporters warning of mass layoffs and broken supply chains.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs are straining ties with the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. India vows not to yield, while Americans face higher prices and global rifts widen as New Delhi looks to China and Russia.Source: NPRBlackRock Warns Public Pensions Are Becoming Too PoliticizedWhat Happened: BlackRock cautioned that asset managers are being pressured to align pension fund investments with political agendas. The firm argued that turning retirement savings into a partisan battleground ultimately harms savers.Why It Matters: With $12.5 trillion under management, BlackRock sits at the center of the ESG wars. Its warning highlights how America\u2019s culture fights now extend to pension funds\u2014risking retirees\u2019 security as politicians weaponize investment policy.Source: Bloomberg News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/6- Next Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501After Threats, Mayors of Blue Cities Seek United Front Against TrumpWhat Happened: As Trump deploys federal forces into cities, Democratic mayors held a private strategy call to coordinate resistance. Led by Cleveland\u2019s Justin Bibb, the group vowed to present a united safety message, prepare legal action, and push back against being used as political pawns.Source: New York TimesSen. Susan Collins heckled by protesters at Maine ribbon-cutting eventWhat Happened: Sen. Susan Collins was drowned out by protesters chanting \u201cshame\u201d during a Route 1 ribbon-cutting in Searsport. Demonstrators blasted her over Medicare cuts, Gaza, and Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, with some urging voters to back her Democratic challenger.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers9/6 \u2014 Next Day of Action$200 million \u2014 Pledged by Silicon Valley investors to new pro-AI super PACs$1 billion \u2014 Kushner\u2019s condo venture in the Balkans, echoing his Gaza \u201cresort\u201d schemes1,800+ \u2014 National Park Service employees lost since Trump took office90 \u2014 Parks reporting serious problems under Trump\u2019s cuts37 \u2014 Officials stripped of security clearances by Tulsi Gabbard, including one undercover CIA officer36 \u2014 FEMA staff put on leave after warning of Trump\u2019s appointees crippling disaster response2,200+ \u2014 National Guard troops diverted to landscaping and trash duty in D.C.$43 billion \u2014 Annual contribution of international students to the U.S. economy60,000+ \u2014 Jobs supported by international students now at risk500+ \u2014 Credible abuse reports in ICE custody uncovered by Senate probe7 \u2014 Migrants disappeared to Rwanda in August under Trump\u2019s new relocation deal$48.2 billion \u2014 Indian exports threatened by Trump\u2019s new tariff hikes25% \u2014 Share of National Park Service workforce lost under Trump\u2019s purges\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump\u2019s ICE is disappearing American citizens \u2014 How far will the regime be allowed to go in bypassing due process and constitutional protections?The CDC is in collapse after Trump\u2019s purge of its leadership \u2014 Will Congress step in before America is left unprepared for the next health crisis?Democratic mayors are trying to hold the line as Trump escalates his federal invasion of cities \u2014 Can they withstand the pressure?Trump\u2019s tariffs and corporate power grabs are shaking the economy \u2014 Will they push the U.S. into a recession?Big Tech is pouring $200 million into pro-AI super PACs \u2014 Will this reshape elections to lock in their policies?Trump is twisting civil rights law into a political weapon \u2014 How far will he go in crushing blue states and dismantling regulations?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Weaponization of Law \u2014 From RICO charges to civil rights probes, Trump is twisting legal tools into weapons of partisan retribution.Science Purge \u2014 Trump and RFK Jr. are hollowing out the CDC and FDA, steering health policy toward anti-vaccine ideology and leaving the country exposed to preventable illness.Authoritarian Tactics \u2014 From Greenland covert ops to ICE targeting journalists, Trump is borrowing from the Putin playbook to expand power at home and abroad.Assault on Education \u2014 Through Leo Terrell\u2019s task force and civil rights manipulation, Trump is dismantling diversity programs and wants to turn universities into MAGA loyalty grounds.Collapse of Public Services \u2014 From FEMA purges to hollowed-out National Parks, Trump\u2019s regime is draining capacity, eroding safety, and gutting essential government functions and services.Corruption as Policy \u2014 Kushner, Musk, and Trump allies are monetizing crises\u2014from Gaza real estate schemes to surveillance contracts\u2014turning government into a profit machine for insiders.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.
