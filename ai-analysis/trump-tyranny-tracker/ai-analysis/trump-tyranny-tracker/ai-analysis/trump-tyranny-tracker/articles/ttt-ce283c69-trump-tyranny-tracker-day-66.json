  "content": "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, and John Ratcliffe, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, were among the cabinet officials who testified at a hearing held by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 26Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsFend for Yourself: Under Trump, Consumer Protection Bureau\u2019s Probes of Big Tech and Finance Firms Freeze UpWhat Happened: Since Trump moved to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency has dropped lawsuits against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes, and frozen dozens of probes\u2014targeting Meta, Carvana, CareCredit, and more. Internal investigations, including into firms with prior penalties for harming consumers, have stalled under Musk\u2019s direction.Why It Matters: The enforcement freeze signals a systemic rollback of consumer protections. Major corporations will now dodge accountability for abuses, leaving millions of Americans vulnerable to predatory financial practices. This is corruption\u2014plain and simple\u2014where power shields profit and the public pays the price.Source: ProPublicaSpaceX Quietly Opens Door to Chinese Investment Through Offshore Secrecy HubsWhat Happened: Court records reveal that Musk\u2019s SpaceX, a major U.S. military contractor, permits Chinese investors to buy into the company\u2014so long as the money flows through offshore secrecy jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands. Why It Matters: While SpaceX builds spy satellites for the U.S. government, it\u2019s quietly letting Chinese investors in through offshore loopholes. This is a deliberate tactic to hide foreign influence\u2014and potentially puts U.S. defense secrets at risk. This isn\u2019t just corruption\u2014it\u2019s dangerous.Source: ProPublicaTrump Family Crypto Firm Launches StablecoinWhat Happened: World Liberty Financial, the Trump family\u2019s crypto venture, announced the launch of USD1, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and custodied by BitGo. The firm is led by Trump and his children, including Eric and Don Jr.Why It Matters: Trump is pushing crypto from the Oval Office while his family cashes in\u2014$550 million raised, and 75% of revenue goes to a Trump-tied firm. He\u2019s governing a volatile industry he profits from, blurring the line between policy and personal gain. It\u2019s a glaring ethics minefield.Source: The Hill In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Election Order Faces Major Constitutional HurdlesWhat Happened: Trump signed a sweeping executive order mandating proof of citizenship to register to vote and requiring that ballots be received by Election Day to count. The order also threatens to withhold federal funds from states that don\u2019t comply. Legal experts, election officials, and multiple state attorneys general say the order oversteps presidential authority and is likely unconstitutional, warning it violates the Elections Clause, which gives power over election administration to states and Congress\u2014not the president.Why It Matters: Trump is trying to seize control over elections by executive order\u2014a move that oversteps presidential authority and violates the separation of powers. It\u2019s a blatant power grab, and lawsuits are already brewing.Source: Associated PressGeorgia GOP Pushes Bill to Purge Voters, Force Hand CountsWhat Happened: Georgia Republicans advanced a last-minute bill that would allow Trump-aligned state election officials to purge thousands of voters and force poll workers to hand-count ballots. The bill also pushes Georgia to leave ERIC, a bipartisan system used to maintain accurate voter rolls.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated effort to suppress votes and sow chaos ahead of 2026. Hand-count mandates and voter roll purges will delay results, overwhelm election workers, and increase the risk of disenfranchisement\u2014undermining trust in Georgia\u2019s elections.Source: Associated PressDOGE Plotted to Seize Treasury Systems, Cut Off USAIDWhat Happened: New court documents show Musk and his operatives gained deep access to U.S. Treasury payment systems to halt USAID funding. Marko Elez was granted unprecedented access to federal databases controlling trillions in payments. Musk operatives used this to manually block aid and dismantle USAID contracts, violating internal protocols.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian overreach. Musk\u2019s unvetted team weaponized Treasury systems to sabotage foreign aid and gut USAID\u2014an unprecedented abuse of power that threatens U.S. governance and global humanitarian efforts.Source: WIREDTreasury Planning to Lay Off \u2018Substantial Number\u2019 of EmployeesWhat Happened: The Treasury Department is preparing major layoffs under Trump\u2019s executive order directing federal agencies to implement Musk\u2019s purge. Affected employees include reinstated probationary workers\u2014recently ordered back after unlawful terminations.Why It Matters: The cuts could hollow out critical financial institutions like the IRS and Bureau of Fiscal Service, while disproportionately targeting newer, lower-seniority employees. The move reflects Trump\u2019s broader aim to shrink and politicize the civil service.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJudge Says DOJ Attacked Her to Undermine U.S. CourtsWhat Happened: U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell denied a Trump push to remove her from a case, blasting the DOJ for launching personal attacks on her to discredit the judiciary. She warned the move was part of a larger strategy to shift blame from weak legal arguments to judges who rule against Trump.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on judicial independence. Trump\u2019s DOJ is smearing judges to try and rig the system in his favor, echoing tactics used by authoritarian regimes to silence courts and consolidate power.Source: Associated PressTrump Investigating Portland Schools Over Transgender AthleteWhat Happened: The Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is investigating Portland Public Schools and the Oregon School Activities Association for allowing a transgender girl to compete in girls\u2019 track events and use the girls\u2019 locker room. Why It Matters: This marks the latest enforcement action under Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women\u2019s sports \u2014 a move sharply at odds with Oregon law, which protects trans students' rights. Source: The HillTrump considers killing big energy projects in Dem statesWhat Happened: Trump is weighing cuts to four hydrogen energy hubs located in Democratic-leaning states\u2014including California, Oregon, and Illinois\u2014while preserving funding for three hubs in Republican states like Texas, West Virginia, and the Dakotas. The projects were part of a $7 billion bipartisan initiative launched under Biden\u2019s infrastructure law.Why It Matters: This would be political retribution disguised as budget policy. Trump is targeting clean energy projects in blue states while protecting those in red states\u2014punishing regions that didn\u2019t vote for him. It guts climate investment and turns energy funding into a partisan weapon.Source: PoliticoWhite House Taps Musk to Investigate Signal Chat MishapWhat Happened: Musk and his operatives have been enlisted by the White House to investigate how The Atlantic's editor was accidentally added to a Signal chat containing sensitive military discussions among top Trump officials.Why It Matters: In a normal world, the FBI or DOJ would investigate a national security breach\u2014not an unelected billionaire with a clear conflict of interest. Handing Musk the job of probing a Signal leak involving war plans is reckless, unethical, and symptomatic of a government captured by cronies.Source: The HillFederal Agents Attempted to Detain Health Worker at D.C. School, Officials SayWhat Happened: Federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations tried to detain a D.C. Health contractor outside H.D. Cooke Elementary School in Northwest D.C. as children arrived. School staff demanded a warrant and ID\u2014the agents left without making an arrest.Why It Matters: This was a show of force, not a mistake. Sending federal agents to a school\u2014especially one with a large immigrant population\u2014sends a chilling message. DHS\u2019s vague excuse shows that no place is off-limits. Schools, hospitals, and churches are now targets.Source: The Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump's voting rights order targets anybody who's 'not white,' advocates sayWhat Happened: Trump signed a sweeping executive order requiring proof of citizenship to vote, mandating REAL ID or passport documentation, and threatening to withhold funding from states that don\u2019t comply. It also centralizes voter roll purges and bans counting ballots received after Election Day.Why It Matters: Voting rights groups warn the order could disenfranchise millions\u2014particularly nonwhite, low-income, and elderly citizens\u2014by imposing burdensome ID requirements. Critics say it\u2019s a clear attempt to suppress the vote under the guise of election security while shifting election control to the executive branch.Source: USA TODAY\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsCIA Director: \u2018No Assessment\u2019 U.S. at War With Venezuela Amid Trump\u2019s Deportation PushWhat Happened: CIA Director John Ratcliffe testified that the agency has \u201cno assessment\u201d that the U.S. is at war with Venezuela\u2014undermining Trump\u2019s justification for invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Trump claims gang members from Tren de Aragua are tied to the Maduro regime.Why It Matters: The Alien Enemies Act has never been used this way and is intended for wartime. Ratcliffe\u2019s statement could prove pivotal in ongoing court challenges against the deportations. Source: The HillUS citizens getting pulled aside: Travelers fear scrutiny at the border is risingWhat Happened: U.S. citizens and legal residents are increasingly being flagged for secondary inspection, device searches, and questioning at borders\u2014even when using Global Entry. A wave of detentions and rising enforcement have triggered fears about arbitrary or politically motivated scrutiny.Why It Matters: The surge in border interrogations is fueling anxiety and deterring international travel, even for U.S. citizens\u2014signaling a shift toward surveillance-heavy, fear-based immigration enforcement that blurs legal protections. A classic tactic of authoritarian regimes.Source: USA TODAYTurkish Student at Tufts Detained by Feds, Video Shows Masked People Handcuffing HerWhat Happened: Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained by masked DHS officers Tuesday night without charges. Her lawyer says she was taken without explanation while walking to break her Ramadan fast and is now being held at an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just about immigration or antisemitism\u2014it\u2019s about punishing dissent. Arresting international students over speech and activism signals a dangerous abuse of power and sets a precedent: speak out, and you will be disappeared. First, it\u2019s foreign students. Next, it\u2019s everyone.Source: Rolling StoneSenate Confirms Trump\u2019s Anti-Abortion Pick to Lead the FDAWhat Happened: The Senate voted 56\u201344 to confirm Martin Makary as FDA Commissioner. A known anti-abortion advocate, Makary has spread disinformation about abortion pills and refused to commit to protecting their FDA approval during his confirmation hearing. Three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting his appointment.Why It Matters: Makary\u2019s confirmation gives Trump a powerful lever to restrict access to abortion pills, which account for more than half of all abortions in the U.S. His leadership could pave the way for revoking FDA approval of the drugs, in line with the Project 2025 agenda\u2014despite overwhelming scientific evidence of their safety and effectiveness. This is part of a broader attack on women\u2019s rights.Source: Mother JonesForeign Aid Cuts Could Cause Millions of HIV Deaths, Study WarnsWhat Happened: A new Lancet HIV study estimates Trump\u2019s aid cuts\u2014spearheaded by Musk and including the freeze on PEPFAR and USAID HIV/AIDS programs\u2014could cause up to 10.8 million new infections and nearly 3 million deaths by 2030.Why It Matters: U.S. funding has been vital in fighting HIV globally. Researchers say slashing support now could erase decades of progress and trigger a resurgence of the epidemic worldwide.Source: CBS NewsStudent Arrested Amid Trump Crackdown on International StudentsWhat Happened: U.S. immigration agents detained a doctoral student from Iran studying mechanical engineering at the University of Alabama. The arrest occurred off-campus early Tuesday, and the justification remains unclear. ICE and DHS have not commented.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just about immigration or antisemitism\u2014it\u2019s about punishing dissent. Arresting international students over speech and activism signals a dangerous abuse of power and sets a precedent: speak out, and you will be disappeared with no due process. First, it\u2019s foreign students. Source: The GuardianEducation Dept. Civil Rights Cuts Leave Cases in DisarrayWhat Happened: Over 200 attorneys were abruptly fired and half the Office for Civil Rights regional offices shuttered amid Trump cuts at the Department of Education. Attorneys say there was no plan to transition thousands of active civil rights cases, many of which are now in limbo.Why It Matters: The lack of coordination means complainants won\u2019t know who is handling their case\u2014or if it\u2019s being handled at all. Former staff say they were locked out of systems before they could update or transfer case files, risking justice for students facing discrimination.Source: NOTUS Trump revokes state and local health fundingWhat Happened: The Department of Health and Human Services abruptly canceled $11.4 billion in public health grants used for infectious disease tracking, vaccinations, and mental health services. The move targets programs originally funded during the COVID-19 pandemic.Why It Matters: While HHS claims the pandemic is over and the funds are no longer needed, health officials warn the grants are critical for addressing ongoing threats like measles outbreaks and modernizing outdated health systems. The regime says the funds will be redirected to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda \u201cfocused\u201d on chronic disease.Source: The HillTrump Cuts U.S. Funding to Global Vaccine Program GaviWhat Happened: The White House is ending U.S. funding for Gavi, a global vaccine alliance that has helped immunize over 1.1 billion children against deadly diseases like COVID-19, Ebola, and malaria. The U.S. was Gavi\u2019s third-largest donor, contributing 12% of its budget.Why It Matters: Without U.S. support, Gavi warns millions of children could lose access to life-saving vaccines. Public health advocates and legal experts say the cut may be unlawful, as foreign aid decisions rest with Congress. Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchNATO clarifies comments that four missing US soldiers had died during training in LithuaniaWhat Happened: NATO walked back a statement from Secretary-General Mark Rutte suggesting four missing U.S. soldiers had died during a training exercise in Lithuania. The U.S. Army said the soldiers\u2019 armored vehicle was found submerged, but recovery efforts are ongoing. Asked about the situation, Trump said he had not been briefed.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s lack of awareness about missing U.S. troops in a NATO exercise near the Belarus border highlights a disturbing breakdown in national security communication.Source: Associated Press\u2018Reckless and Dangerous\u2019: Hegseth Leaked Sensitive Attack Details, Officials SayWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Hegseth shared highly sensitive operational details in a Signal chat about a pending U.S. strike on Houthi targets. The Atlantic published texts showing Hegseth disclosed aircraft types and strike timing \u2014 information experts say is typically top secret. Why It Matters: Current and former Pentagon officials say the leaks could have endangered U.S. troops and violated security protocols. Senator Mark Kelly called it \u201cthe most sensitive information we have,\u201d labeling Hegseth\u2019s behavior \u201creckless and dangerous.\u201dSource: Politico\ud83d\udea8DOGE Staffer 'Big Balls' Linked to Cybercrime Ring, Records ShowWhat Happened: Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old Musk operative known online as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d previously provided technical support to EGodly, a cybercrime group that boasted about hacking law enforcement emails and stalking an FBI agent. Reuters found that Coristine\u2019s company, DiamondCDN, hosted EGodly\u2019s site and was publicly thanked by the group in 2023.Why It Matters: Someone who recently supported a cybercrime ring that targeted an FBI agent now has access to the State Department, CISA, and critical U.S. government networks. All of our sensitive information, diplomatic cables, infrastructure vulnerabilities, and personal data are now in the hands of a 19-year-old with a history of helping hackers. This is another glaring national security failure.Source: ReutersTrump Officials\u2019 Venmo Accounts Expose Security Risks, Ties to Signal Strike LeakWhat Happened: National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and other top Trump officials\u2014including White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles\u2014left their Venmo friend lists public, exposing hundreds of personal and professional contacts. The accounts were linked to the now-infamous Signal group chat. Following WIRED\u2019s inquiry, the accounts were set to private.Why It Matters: This is not just digital sloppiness\u2014it\u2019s a national security crisis. Trump\u2019s top officials are revealing sensitive networks to adversaries and making the U.S. more vulnerable to foreign intelligence operations. The same people leaking war plans on Signal are exposing themselves and their contacts on Venmo. It\u2019s reckless, incompetent, and dangerous.Source: WIREDUSAID\u2019s IT Team Collapses Amid Agency ShutdownWhat Happened: USAID\u2019s information technology staff has shrunk from roughly 100 employees to just 5\u2014 as Trump dismantles the agency. The cybersecurity team is on administrative leave, contractors have been removed, and coordination with the State Department has stalled after the disbandment of a joint support team. The agency\u2019s website remains offline, and overseas staff still hold devices containing sensitive government data.Why It Matters: USAID\u2019s collapse poses major national security risks, with critical data left unprotected and technical systems in limbo. The dismantling of the IT team highlights the dangerous chaos and recklessness of Trump\u2019s foreign aid rollback.Source: FedScoopTrump Officials Dismiss Signal Breach, But Ex-Intel Officers Say It Endangered TroopsWhat Happened: Trump is downplaying a group Signal chat in which senior officials shared operational details of a U.S. strike on Yemen. They claim no classified info was leaked. But experts, including former CIA and Pentagon officials, say revealing strike timing and weapon systems could\u2019ve endangered U.S. troops and was \u201c100 percent classified.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s top security team blatantly violated protocols by discussing military operations on an unsecured app\u2014then tried to cover it up. Experts say this failure endangered lives and shows how reckless and unfit the regime is to handle national security.Source: ABC NewsPrivate Data and Passwords of Senior U.S. Security Officials Found OnlineWhat Happened: Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel uncovered a trove of personal data\u2014phone numbers, emails, even passwords\u2014linked to top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The findings, based on commercial people search engines and leaked data, revealed their Signal, WhatsApp, and social profiles\u2014many still active.Why It Matters: The breach highlights a stunning failure of operational security. Officials coordinating a Yemen strike in a Signal chat\u2014including CIA Director Ratcliffe and even a Trump envoy in Russia\u2014used unsecured, publicly traceable accounts. Hostile intelligence services could exploit the exposed data to monitor, hack, or blackmail top U.S. leadership.Source: Der SpiegelDOGE removes details on canceled USAID contracts from its online \"wall of receipts\"What Happened: Musk\u2019s unauthorized FAKE DOGE removed details of 3,214 canceled USAID contracts from its \u201cWall of Receipts\u201d site, citing \u201clegal reasons\u201d tied to ongoing litigation.Why It Matters: A federal judge ruled Musk likely violated the Constitution in shuttering USAID. Experts say Musk inflated savings claims, and the data removal signals growing legal pressure on what many see as an unauthorized and unlawful operation. This entire unauthorized DOGE operation is an illegal sham.Source: CBS NewsVA Cuts Put Veterans\u2019 Mental Health at RiskWhat Happened: The Department of Veterans Affairs is slashing 72,000 jobs\u201415% of its workforce\u2014as part of Trump\u2019s federal gutting. Clinics like Houston\u2019s Michael E. DeBakey VA are overwhelmed, with veterans facing up to four-month waits for basic care and therapy.Why It Matters: Nine million veterans rely on the VA. Advocates warn that reduced staffing and access will worsen already high suicide rates, especially for women veterans.Source: CBS NewsDOGE Shutters Federal Labor Mediation Agency After Trump OrderWhat Happened: Musk shut down the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a 79-year-old independent agency that mediated labor disputes. The move follows a Trump executive order targeting seven agencies for closure. FMCS employees were placed on administrative leave with mass firings expected.Why It Matters: FMCS played a crucial role in resolving major strikes and disputes, saving the U.S. economy an estimated $500 million annually\u2014all while consuming just 0.0014% of the federal budget. Its dismantling will worsen labor unrest and cripple federal dispute resolution.Source: The GuardianTrump Officials Working to Strip FEMA\u2019s Role in Disaster Recovery by Oct. 1What Happened: Trump is planning to sharply diminish FEMA\u2019s disaster recovery role with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem leading talks to shift responsibilities like post-disaster rebuilding and resilience funding to states or private partners. The move could effectively gut FEMA by October 1.Why It Matters: Stripping FEMA\u2019s authority just before hurricane season will devastate states\u2019 ability to respond to major disasters. The closure will disproportionately harm rural and red states that rely on FEMA aid and leave local governments financially unprepared.Source: The Washington PostIRS in Turmoil as Trump Dismantles Agency, Revenue PlummetsWhat Happened: The IRS is facing a projected $500 billion drop in tax revenue by April 15, as Trump rapidly dismantles the agency\u2019s operations. Officials blame the collapse on shrinking enforcement and audits, leading to widespread noncompliance.Why It Matters: Trump is reportedly eyeing IRS taxpayer databases to assist in mass deportation efforts, raising grave privacy concerns. Taxpayer trust is eroding, and experts warn the U.S. could face long-term financial instability.Source: The Washington Post\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUS Allies Alarmed by Leaked Group Chat on Houthi Strike PlansWhat Happened: A Signal chat between senior Trump officials discussing planned strikes on Houthi rebels triggered outrage and renewed questions about U.S. reliability.Why It Matters: European officials call the breach a \u201cscary\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d security failure and undermine trust in intelligence-sharing and joint military operations. Trump\u2019s contempt for allies and chaotic handling of national security is pushing NATO unity to the brink and endangering global partnerships.Source: Military Times\u2018We have to have it\u2019: Trump ups the pressure on GreenlandWhat Happened: Trump reaffirmed his intent to illegally annex Greenland, calling it vital for \u201cinternational safety and security.\u201d This comes ahead of an uninvited trip to the island by Vance, who scaled back his visit to a U.S. military baseWhy It Matters: Trump is trying to intimidate Greenland into giving up land to the U.S.\u2014an aggressive illegal power grab as Danish officials call it \u201cunacceptable pressure.\u201dSource: PoliticoDenmark breathes sigh of relief (for now) as Trump team scales back Greenland tripWhat Happened: A U.S. delegation led by Vance has changed plans for its controversial Greenland trip, limiting the visit to a U.S. military base after fierce backlash from Denmark and Greenlandic leaders.Why It Matters: Danish officials called the change \"wise\" and a \u201cpositive development,\u201d as concerns grew over U.S. interference in the island\u2019s politics during a political transition. Trump is acting like Putin and interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign countries.Source: PoliticoEurope Confronts Reality That Vance\u2019s Hostility Is More Than Just a ShowWhat Happened: Vance has expressed open contempt for Europe, both in private and public, including calling EU officials \u201ccommissars,\u201d berating Zelenskyy, and opposing U.S. military action he believes benefits Europe more than America. In a leaked Signal chat, he said, \u201cI just hate bailing Europe out again.\u201dWhy It Matters: Vance\u2019s antagonism toward Europe goes beyond Trump\u2019s rhetoric and is reshaping U.S. foreign policy. Allies fear a lasting rupture in the transatlantic alliance and question whether the U.S. still views Europe as a partner.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchBessent opens door to Russian return to major international banking systemWhat Happened: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. is open to discussions about letting Russian banks, including Rosselkhozbank, rejoin SWIFT\u2014the global financial messaging system\u2014as part of sham \u201cnegotiations\u201d in Ukraine. Why It Matters: Reopening SWIFT to Russian banks would gut a key sanction without any withdrawal from Ukraine and Bessent\u2019s comments show Trump wants to trade away Ukrainian sovereignty. They\u2019re not defending democracy\u2014they\u2019re doing Putin\u2019s bidding.Source: PoliticoHow Trump\u2019s Policies Have Helped Russia and Furthered Putin\u2019s GoalsWhat Happened: Since returning to office, Trump has pursued a string of policies aligning with Kremlin interests: stalling Ukraine aid, halting U.S. cyber operations targeting Russia, and making public statements accepting Moscow\u2019s illegal annexation of Ukrainian land. Trump has also pulled back from NATO allies, defunded soft-power tools like Voice of America, and floated reopening Russia\u2019s access to SWIFT.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling U.S. alliances and legitimizing Russia\u2019s bloody imperialist land grabs. He\u2019s helping build a world order on Russia\u2019s terms. This isn\u2019t America First. It\u2019s Russia First.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsCanada Freezes Rebate Payments to Tesla, Bans It from Future Programs Due to TariffsWhat Happened: Canada has frozen C$43 million in rebate payments to Tesla and barred Tesla from future EV rebate programs in response to Trump\u2019s new tariffs on Canadian goods. Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland said all existing rebate claims will be individually reviewed and Tesla will remain ineligible for future programs as long as U.S. \u201cillegitimate and illegal\u201d tariffs remain in place.Why It Matters: This is a sharp rebuke of Trump and Musk, signaling growing trade retaliation over U.S. protectionist policies. Tesla, already under scrutiny for flooding the rebate system, now faces international backlash hurting sales and its reputation\u2014while Canada positions itself against U.S. economic aggression.Source: USA TODAYU.S. Projected to Default This Summer Absent Congressional ActionWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office warned that the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills as early as August or September 2025 unless Congress acts to raise or suspend the $36.1 trillion debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government is relying on \"extraordinary measures\" and could exhaust those by late May if revenue falls short.Why It Matters: A default would trigger catastrophic economic consequences, roiling global markets and risking recession. Trump\u2019s call to abolish the debt ceiling altogether has alarmed economists and lawmakers, while GOP infighting continues to delay action.Source: ABC NewsTrump Announces 25% Tariffs on Foreign-Made CarsWhat Happened: Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported automobiles and light trucks, set to take effect April 2. Why It Matters: The tariffs escalate Trump\u2019s protectionist economic policy, risking trade wars with key allies and raising consumer prices. Auto industry leaders warn the move could disrupt supply chains and hurt American jobs dependent on global production.Source: CBS NewsWall Street Job Cuts Loom as Market Turmoil Stalls DealsWhat Happened: U.S. investment banks are preparing for more job cuts as Trump\u2019s tariff threats unsettle markets and stall dealmaking. Q1 investment banking fees dropped 6%, with boutique firms especially hit. JPMorgan and Bank of America have started culling underperformers; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to follow.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aggressive trade stance is fueling economic uncertainty, delaying deals Wall Street hoped would rebound under a pro-business presidency. Analysts warn that if activity doesn\u2019t recover by summer, broader layoffs are likely.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsAppeals Court Blocks Trump\u2019s Wartime Deportation TacticWhat Happened: A federal appeals court upheld a lower court order blocking Trump\u2019s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

Internal investigations, including into firms with prior penalties for harming consumers, have stalled under Musk\u2019s direction.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> The enforcement freeze signals a systemic rollback of consumer protections.

All of Trump's actions seem to be aimed at weakening America and strengthening Russia.  In his internal initiatives he is trying to crush all opposition from opposed institutions and interests, enact a maximalist presidency unchecked by any constraints, invoke obscure laws and put them to use inappropriately, dismantle the government, sow chaos,and remake America in his own image using frankly thuggish tactics.

Yes</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-16 pc-paddingTop-8

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 26</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his

Yourself: Under Trump, Consumer Protection Bureau\\u2019s Probes of Big Tech and Finance Firms Freeze Up</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Since Trump moved to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency has dropped lawsuits against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes, and frozen dozens of probes\\u2014targeting Meta, Carvana, CareCredit, and more. Internal investigations, including into firms with prior penalties for harming consumers, have stalled under Musk\\u2019s direction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The enforcement freeze signals a systemic rollback of consumer protections. Major corporations will now dodge accountability for abuses, leaving millions of Americans vulnerable to predatory financial practices. This is corruption\\u2014plain and simple\\u2014where power shields profit and the public pays the price.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-cfpb-investigation-capital-one-rocket-meta-carvana-greenlight\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>SpaceX Quietly Opens Door to Chinese Investment Through Offshore Secrecy Hubs</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Court records reveal that Musk\\u2019s SpaceX, a major U.S. military contractor, permits Chinese investors to buy into the company\\u2014so long as the money flows through offshore secrecy jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While SpaceX builds spy satellites for the U.S. government, it\\u2019s quietly letting Chinese investors in through offshore loopholes. This is a deliberate tactic to hide foreign influence\\u2014and potentially puts U.S. defense secrets at risk. This isn\\u2019t just corruption\\u2014it\\u2019s dangerous.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-spacex-allows-china-investment-cayman-islands-secrecy\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Family Crypto Firm Launches Stablecoin</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> World Liberty Financial, the Trump family\\u2019s crypto venture, announced the launch of <em>USD1</em>, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and custodied by BitGo. The firm is led by Trump and his children, including Eric and Don Jr.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is pushing crypto from the Oval Office while his family cashes in\\u2014$550 million raised, and 75% of revenue goes to a Trump-tied firm. He\\u2019s governing a volatile industry he profits from, blurring the line between policy and personal gain.

The order also threatens to withhold federal funds from states that don\\u2019t comply. Legal experts, election officials, and multiple state attorneys general say the order oversteps presidential authority and is likely unconstitutional, warning it violates the Elections Clause, which gives power over election administration to states and Congress\\u2014not the president.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump is trying to seize control over elections by executive order\\u2014a move that oversteps presidential authority and violates the separation of powers.

The bill also pushes Georgia to leave ERIC, a bipartisan system used to maintain accurate voter rolls.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a coordinated effort to suppress votes and sow chaos ahead of 2026. Hand-count mandates and voter roll purges will delay results, overwhelm election workers, and increase the risk of disenfranchisement\\u2014undermining trust in Georgia\\u2019s elections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/georgia-election-laws-voter-challenges-hand-count-0f18871d43323f4baf8a5c4c5732c76a\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOGE Plotted to Seize Treasury Systems, Cut Off USAID</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> New court documents show Musk and his operatives gained deep access to U.S. Treasury payment systems to halt USAID funding. Marko Elez was granted unprecedented access to federal databases controlling trillions in payments. Musk operatives used this to manually block aid and dismantle USAID contracts, violating internal protocols.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is authoritarian overreach. Musk\\u2019s unvetted team weaponized Treasury systems to sabotage foreign aid and gut USAID\\u2014an unprecedented abuse of power that threatens U.S. governance and global humanitarian efforts.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-plan-treasury-usaid/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Treasury Planning to Lay Off \\u2018Substantial Number\\u2019 of Employees</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Treasury Department is preparing major layoffs under Trump\\u2019s executive order directing federal agencies to implement Musk\\u2019s purge. Affected employees include reinstated probationary workers\\u2014recently ordered back after unlawful terminations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The cuts could hollow out critical financial institutions like the IRS and Bureau of Fiscal Service, while disproportionately targeting newer, lower-seniority employees.

She warned the move was part of a larger strategy to shift blame from weak legal arguments to judges who rule against Trump.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct assault on judicial independence. Trump\\u2019s DOJ is smearing judges to try and rig the system in his favor, echoing tactics used by authoritarian regimes to silence courts and consolidate power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-judiciary-executive-power-lawsuits-547ba740ad8689c8b8bd80291d2f4ad0\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Investigating Portland Schools Over Transgender Athlete</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Education\\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is investigating Portland Public Schools and the Oregon School Activities Association for allowing a transgender girl to compete in girls\\u2019 track events and use the girls\\u2019 locker room. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks the latest enforcement action under Trump\\u2019s executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women\\u2019s sports \\u2014 a move sharply at odds with Oregon law, which protects trans students' rights. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5215358-trump-administration-portland-schools-transgender-sports-investigation/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump considers killing big energy projects in Dem states</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is weighing cuts to four hydrogen energy hubs located in Democratic-leaning states\\u2014including California, Oregon, and Illinois\\u2014while preserving funding for three hubs in Republican states like Texas, West Virginia, and the Dakotas. The projects were part of a $7 billion bipartisan initiative launched under Biden\\u2019s infrastructure law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would be political retribution disguised as budget policy.

School staff demanded a warrant and ID\\u2014the agents left without making an arrest.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This was a show of force, not a mistake. Sending federal agents to a school\\u2014especially one with a large immigrant population\\u2014sends a chilling message. DHS\\u2019s vague excuse shows that no place is off-limits.

Three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting his appointment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Makary\\u2019s confirmation gives Trump a powerful lever to restrict access to abortion pills, which account for more than half of all abortions in the U.S. His leadership could pave the way for revoking FDA approval of the drugs, in line with the Project 2025 agenda\\u2014despite overwhelming scientific evidence of their safety and effectiveness.
