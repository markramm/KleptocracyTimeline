  "content": "The Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.Credit...Valerie Plesch for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 21Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udea8Republicans are trying to rewrite history, whitewash Russia\u2019s attack on the 2016 election, and set up indictments against those who investigated it. We won\u2019t let themCheck out our latest article in the new series Julie and I launched \u2026 The next chapter drops next Monday!Unmasking RussiaNazis, The Kremlin, and TrumpPutin\u2019s Dresden Days\u2026Read more13 days ago \u00b7 86 likes \u00b7 4 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump demands release of Colorado official sentenced in election data schemeWhat Happened: Trump again demanded the release of Tina Peters, the former Colorado election clerk convicted of breaching voting equipment in search of fraud, warning he would take \u201charsh measures\u201d if she isn\u2019t freed. Peters, 69, is serving nine years in prison after being found guilty on multiple felony counts.Why It Matters: Trump is deliberately turning a convicted election-security breach carried out on his behalf into a political cause, showing loyalists that sabotaging voting systems is acceptable if it helps him. By threatening \u201charsh measures,\u201d he is openly undermining state authority, further emboldening extremists, and eroding trust in U.S. elections.Source: Washington PostDemocrats Probe Paramount-Skydance Merger Over Trump DealingsWhat Happened: House Democrats Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone launched a probe into whether Paramount and Skydance caved to Trump\u2019s \u201cillegitimate demands\u201d to secure FCC approval for their merger. The inquiry points to Paramount\u2019s $16 million settlement with Trump and his claim Skydance agreed to provide millions in free public service ads, with Sen. Adam Schiff pressing the FCC on Trump\u2019s involvement.Why It Matters: The case raises alarms that Trump is using regulatory power to extract personal and political concessions from corporations. It would turn merger approvals into pay-to-play schemes, fusing corporate compliance with presidential demands.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsSteve Bannon just laid out the MAGA media playbook to subvert the midtermsWhat Happened: On his War Room show, Steve Bannon detailed a MAGA plan to rig the 2026 elections\u2014deploying ICE agents to polling places, banning mail-in voting, pushing mid-decade redistricting, and running a voter-suppression tour with election deniers. Trump has already signaled support, celebrating Texas Republicans\u2019 new gerrymandered map and calling for paper ballots only.Why It Matters: This is the authoritarian blueprint in plain sight. By fusing voter intimidation, gerrymandering, and election denial propaganda, Bannon is mapping how Trump and MAGA plan to cement power, silence opposition, and dismantle checks ahead of the midterms.Source: Media MattersTexas Senate passes new Republican-drawn congressional mapWhat Happened: The Texas Senate approved a new Republican-drawn congressional map that could give the GOP up to five additional House seats. Gov. Greg Abbott, backed by Trump, is set to sign the plan into law, while Democrats vow to challenge it in court.Why It Matters: Trump demanded the redraw to secure more Republican seats, and Texas delivered\u2014years before the next census. The aggressive gerrymander undermines minority representation and shows how the GOP is manipulating maps to lock in power ahead of 2026.Source: NBC News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJudge says former Trump lawyer Alina Habba has been unlawfully serving as US attorney in New JerseyWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that former Trump lawyer Alina Habba has been unlawfully serving as U.S. attorney in New Jersey since July. The court found that Trump bypassed Senate confirmation rules with a string of temporary appointments, declaring Habba\u2019s actions may be void but pausing the order for appeal.Why It Matters: The ruling strikes at Trump\u2019s broader strategy of stacking U.S. attorney offices with loyalists outside legal channels. If upheld, it could unravel prosecutions she pursued and expose similar illegal appointments nationwide, underscoring the regime\u2019s attempt to sidestep constitutional checks.Source: Associated PressICE director says he\u2019ll \u2018flood\u2019 Boston after Mayor Wu refuses to comply with fedsWhat Happened: Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons vowed to \u201cflood the zone\u201d with agents in Boston after Mayor Michelle Wu refused to comply with Trump\u2019s demands to scrap sanctuary protections. Wu said the city won\u2019t \u201cbow down to unconstitutional threats,\u201d rejecting Pam Bondi\u2019s warning that sanctuary cities could lose federal funds or face prosecution.Why It Matters: The threat marks an escalation of Trump\u2019s war on sanctuary cities, turning federal immigration enforcement into a tool of political punishment. It sets up a showdown between local autonomy and Trump\u2019s expanding federal crackdown.Source: The HillTrump officials cut California sex-education funds over gender identity referencesWhat Happened: Trump revoked California\u2019s $6 million federal sex-education grant\u2014potentially rising to $12 million\u2014after the state refused to strip references to transgender and nonbinary people from its curriculum. Officials warned all states receiving federal sex-ed funds that LGBTQ+ content must be removed or face similar cuts.Why It Matters: The move weaponizes federal funding to impose an anti-LGBTQ agenda on education, undermining inclusive sex ed that experts say reduces bullying and saves lives. It signals a broader push to replace comprehensive sex ed with abstinence-only programs aligned with Project 2025.Source: The GuardianFederal investigators demand details on trans patients from at least one hospitalWhat Happened: Federal investigators under Pam Bondi subpoenaed at least 20 hospitals and clinics for records on transgender youth, including names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers. One subpoena to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia demanded patient identities, billing records, and staff files, part of Trump\u2019s push to restrict gender-affirming care even where it remains legal.Why It Matters: Forcing hospitals to surrender private patient data shatters doctor-patient confidentiality and weaponizes healthcare as state surveillance. The intimidation is already driving hospitals to halt treatment, pushing Trump\u2019s anti-trans agenda through fear and coercion rather than legislation.Source: NBC NewsTexas threatens to sue organizations and doctor for increasing abortion pill accessWhat Happened: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent cease-and-desist letters to Plan C, Her Safe Harbor, and Dr. R\u00e9my Coeytaux, accusing them of mailing or facilitating abortion pills for Texans. He threatened lawsuits under the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, while providers vowed to keep helping patients despite the threats.Why It Matters: With nearly all abortions banned in Texas, pills remain the main lifeline for reproductive care. Paxton\u2019s crackdown seeks to criminalize providers across state lines, escalating legal battles that could shape post-Roe access nationwide.Source: The GuardianState Dept. fires official after internal debates over IsraelWhat Happened: The State Department fired Shahed Ghoreishi, press officer for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, after he proposed statements opposing Gaza displacement and mourning slain journalists.Why It Matters: The firing underscores the State Department's enforcement of hardline pro-Israel messaging and punishing dissent, underscoring U.S. support for potential illegal Gaza expulsions and silencing career diplomats.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump administration\u2019s anti-woke campaign targets Smithsonian museumsWhat Happened: Trump flagged seven Smithsonian museums\u2014including those on Latino, African, and Asian art\u2014for review, accusing them of pushing \u201canti-American\u201d narratives. He cited exhibits on slavery, colonization, and George Floyd\u2019s murder, with officials ordering \u201ccontent corrections\u201d within 30 days.Why It Matters: Trump is extending his culture war into America\u2019s top museums, pressuring curators to sanitize history in favor of MAGA narratives. The move threatens scholarly independence, erases facts about racism and injustice, and recasts cultural institutions as propaganda tools.Source: The GuardianTrump, GOP portray cities as chaotic dystopias in need of occupationWhat Happened: Trump and Republicans are depicting U.S. cities as violent \u201ccesspools\u201d to justify military incursions like those in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Despite falling crime rates, Trump has threatened to occupy more cities, cut funding, and sue \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions, with GOP allies amplifying apocalyptic portrayals of urban life.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s anti-urban narrative makes cities political targets, stoking rural-urban divides and paving the way for authoritarian federal takeovers. Mayors warn that his rhetoric distorts reality, weaponizes race, and erodes local autonomy.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News'It\u2019s alarming': Education Department revokes guidance on English learning servicesWhat Happened: The Education Department revoked Obama-era guidance requiring schools to provide services for 5 million English-learning students, calling it \u201coverly prescriptive\u201d and leaving states to decide how to serve them. The rollback removes accountability and opens the door to discrimination and reduced resources for immigrant children.Why It Matters: The move strips vital protections for English learners, most of whom are U.S. citizens, and weakens federal oversight meant to ensure equal education. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader push to marginalize immigrant communities and politicize schools, leaving millions of kids at risk of being left behind.Source: ABC NewsU.S. broadens search for deportation agreements, striking deals with Honduras and Uganda, documents showWhat Happened: Internal documents show that Trump officials struck new deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda to accept migrants. Uganda agreed to take African migrants without criminal records, while Honduras will accept several hundred Latin American deportees. Why It Matters: Trump is outsourcing America\u2019s asylum obligations, disappearing vulnerable migrants to countries with horrific human rights records and no ties to them. This cruel practice undermines due process and international refugee protections.Source: CBS NewsAppeals court allows end of protected status for migrants from 3 countriesWhat Happened: A federal appeals court cleared the way for Trump to end Temporary Protected Status for about 60,000 migrants, including 51,000 Hondurans, 3,000 Nicaraguans, and 7,000 Nepalese. Their protections will expire in the coming weeks, making them eligible for deportation after decades of lawful residence.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s shameful mass deportation push, stripping legal status from immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for decades. It destabilizes families with U.S.-citizen children and weaponizes immigration law to serve his political agenda.Source: NPRLiving in the shadows: Why stateless people fear Trump's immigration crackdownWhat Happened: Roughly 218,000 stateless people in the U.S. face heightened risk as Trump moves to revoke naturalized citizenship and challenge birthright citizenship. Advocates warn these policies would create a new wave of stateless individuals, many already facing detention and deportation to countries they\u2019ve never lived in.Why It Matters: Stateless people are uniquely vulnerable\u2014without citizenship, they can\u2019t work legally, access services, or return anywhere if deported. Trump\u2019s crackdown makes their lives even more precarious, pushing them into the shadows and raising the specter of indefinite detention.Source: NPRTrump Budget Office Is Withholding H.I.V. Funds That Congress AppropriatedWhat Happened: Trump is releasing less than half of the $6 billion Congress appropriated this year for PEPFAR, the landmark HIV prevention and treatment program credited with saving 26 million lives. Budget head Russell Vought has allocated just $2.9 billion, despite bipartisan backing and a legal requirement to disburse funds.Why It Matters: Slashing PEPFAR cripples one of America\u2019s most successful global health programs, jeopardizing treatment for millions abroad while eroding U.S. leadership. It also defies Congress\u2019s power of the purse, as Trump bends spending laws to advance his ideological war on foreign aid.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s USDA Eliminates Support for Renewable Energy, a Lifeline for FarmersWhat Happened: The USDA announced it will cut funding for wind and solar projects on farmland, ending a key Biden-era program that helped farmers earn income and reduce energy costs. Instead, Trump is steering support toward biofuels.Why It Matters: Farmers lose a crucial financial lifeline as Trump props up fossil fuels and biofuels, stalling the transition to clean energy while tightening control over agricultural policy.Source: Mother JonesHow Deeply Trump Has Cut Federal Health AgenciesWhat Happened: Since January, HHS has purged over 20,500 workers\u2014nearly 18% of its staff\u2014including 3,000 scientists, 1,000 regulators, and thousands of support staff. The cuts have crippled the CDC, NIH, and FDA, halting vaccine research, delaying grants, skimping on lab supplies, and driving out senior experts.Why It Matters: The U.S. is being left dangerously exposed to outbreaks, unsafe drugs, and weakened disease prevention. Decades of expertise are being gutted, replaced by political appointees, creating long-term risks to public health and safety.Source: ProPublicaAt least 600 CDC employees are getting final termination notices, union saysWhat Happened: At least 600 CDC employees received permanent termination notices this week, according to their union. The cuts, which hit areas like violence prevention just days after a gunman attacked CDC\u2019s campus, are part of Trump\u2019s sweeping dismantling of federal health agencies.Why It Matters: Purging the CDC guts America\u2019s frontline defense against disease and public health crises. Trump\u2019s purge strips away irreplaceable expertise, leaving the country weaker, less prepared, and more vulnerable to future emergencies.Source: NBC NewsCDC funding changes inject \u2018chaos\u2019 into local health programsWhat Happened: Trump has delayed or blocked millions in CDC grants, forcing layoffs and disrupting programs on HIV prevention, tobacco control, disaster preparedness, and more. Local health departments say unauthorized DOGE\u2019s new reviews and month-by-month funding have created huge backlogs, with some grants lapsing before renewal.Why It Matters: Public health agencies are losing staff and falling behind on disease tracking, disaster readiness, and prevention. Trump\u2019s funding chokehold is gutting health infrastructure, turning routine grant dispersal into chaos that leaves everyone more vulnerable to outbreaks and emergencies.Source: The HillF.B.I. Plans to Lower Recruiting Standards, Alarming AgentsWhat Happened: The FBI plans to cut training from 18 weeks to 8 and drop its college degree requirement. Leaders say it will help fill gaps as 5,000 staff depart, but many agents warn it will weaken national security and shift the bureau toward street policing.Why It Matters: The move strips the FBI of its elite reputation and will gut complex investigations into corruption, fraud, and espionage. Critics call it \u201cgenerational destruction,\u201d warning the bureau could become little more than a federal police force doing Trump\u2019s bidding.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchFar fewer Canadians are visiting the U.S. this year, new numbers showWhat Happened: Canadian visits to the U.S. have plummeted, with July border crossings down 37% from last year and overall 2025 travel down 17%. The drop follows Trump\u2019s steep tariffs on Canada and his insane annexation threats straining relations and discouraging cross-border tourism.Why It Matters: Canada is America\u2019s top source of foreign tourists, generating $20 billion a year and supporting 140,000 jobs. Trump\u2019s trade war and hostile rhetoric are gutting border economies, from golf resorts in New York to tour boats in Buffalo.Source: NPRTrump administration to review all 55m US visa holders for potential rule violationsWhat Happened: Trump officials announced a review of all 55 million valid U.S. visa holders under a new \u201ccontinuous vetting\u201d program that monitors for overstays, crimes, or \u201canti-American\u201d views\u2014including social media posts. Visas can be revoked at any time, leaving holders in the U.S. subject to deportation.Why It Matters: This dragnet makes every foreign student, worker, and visitor a surveillance target. By policing speech and political views, Trump is turning immigration into a MAGA loyalty test\u2014chilling dissent and destabilizing campuses and workplaces nationwide.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussian hackers targeting critical infrastructure IT systems: FBIWhat Happened: The FBI said Russian hackers have exploited old vulnerabilities in Cisco devices to infiltrate U.S. critical infrastructure networks. The group, dubbed \u201cStatic Tundra,\u201d has modified systems for long-term access and is focusing on telecom, manufacturing, and universities.Why It Matters: Russian intelligence continue probing U.S. industrial systems for sabotage. Unpatched devices leave critical sectors exposed, fueling fears of major disruptions to essential services.Source: The HillGabbard barred sharing intelligence on Russia-Ukraine negotiations with \"Five Eyes\" partnersWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to stop sharing information on Russia-Ukraine negotiations with the Five Eyes alliance. The July directive marked all related intelligence as \u201cNOFORN,\u201d cutting off even the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand from access.Why It Matters: This shatters decades of intelligence-sharing, cutting the U.S. off from its closest allies during Russia\u2019s genocidal war. It weakens alliances and leverage while Trump and Gabbard, acting like a Russian asset, put secrecy and control over collective defense.Source: CBS NewsThis Kyiv woman survived a 9-story fall from her home during a Russian missile attackWhat Happened: Veronika Osintseva was thrown from her ninth-floor apartment during a Russian drone strike in Kyiv, surviving with only a fractured leg while her parents and 32 others were killed. Pulled from the rubble by a stranger, her improbable survival has made her a national symbol of resilience amid Russia\u2019s relentless bombardment.Why It Matters: Osintseva\u2019s survival offers Ukrainians a rare story of hope. Her plea to world leaders\u2014voiced as Trump pushes a Ukrainian surrender plan\u2014underscores the desperation of civilians who simply want the killing to stop.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsEnergy prices could be election issue as voters see jump in utility billsWhat Happened: Utility bills across several East Coast states have spiked, with New Jersey residents seeing 17\u201320% increases this summer. PJM Interconnection, the nation\u2019s largest grid operator, cites soaring energy demand from AI, data centers, and manufacturing, while critics blame its reluctance to bring renewables online. Why It Matters: Soaring utility bills are hurting households and fueling voter anger in swing states. Trump promised to slash prices, but instead costs are rising due to failed energy policy and corporate mismanagement.Source: CBS NewsWalmart Says Tariffs Driving Up Costs \u2018Each Week\u2019What Happened: Walmart said Trump\u2019s tariffs are raising costs weekly, forcing gradual price hikes on goods like electronics and furniture. The retailer has absorbed much of the burden by squeezing suppliers and stockpiling imports, but warns those buffers are running out, meaning shoppers will soon face higher prices more broadly.Why It Matters: As the world\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart\u2019s struggles show how tariffs are inflating costs across the economy. The squeeze falls hardest on lower- and middle-income families, who are effectively paying Trump\u2019s tax hike.Source: NPR\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501California Gov. Newsom signs legislation calling special election on redrawn congressional mapWhat Happened: California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation calling a November special election on a redrawn congressional map designed to net Democrats five additional House seats. The move comes after Texas Republicans advanced a Trump map to lock in five more GOP seats.Source: Associated PressState Dept. Unlawfully Withheld Visas Under Trump\u2019s Travel Ban, Judge RulesWhat Happened: A federal judge found that Trump illegally withheld visas from dozens of 2024 diversity lottery winners under his travel ban affecting 19 countries. The court ordered the State Department to process 82 pending cases from applicants in Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran, and elsewhere, though entry is not guaranteed.Source: New York TimesFlorida judge orders dismantling of Alligator AlcatrazWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked the expansion of Florida\u2019s controversial \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d migrant internment facility, ruling it violated environmental protections in the Everglades and restricted tribal access. The order requires Florida to dismantle generators, fencing, and waste systems within 60 days and prohibits bringing in new detainees.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers9/1 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action30 days \u2014 Deadline Smithsonian museums were given to make \u201ccontent corrections\u201d (rewrite history)5 million \u2014 English-learning students impacted by loss of federal protections60,000 \u2014 Migrants losing Temporary Protected Status, including 51,000 Hondurans, 3,000 Nicaraguans, and 7,000 Nepalese218,000 \u2014 Stateless people in the U.S. now at risk of detention and deportation$6 billion \u2014 Annual PEPFAR funding Congress mandated$2.9 billion \u2014 Amount actually released by Trump\u2019s budget office20,500+ \u2014 Workers purged from HHS since January (nearly 18% of staff)600 \u2014 CDC employees issued termination notices37% \u2014 Drop in Canadian border crossings in July compared to 202417% \u2014 Overall decline in Canadian travel to the U.S. in early 202555 million \u2014 U.S. visa holders subject to Trump\u2019s new \u201ccontinuous vetting\u201d program5,000 \u2014 Estimated staff departing the FBI \ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump\u2019s ICE is disappearing American citizens \u2014 How far will the regime be allowed to go in bypassing due process and constitutional protections?Trump\u2019s assault on the Federal Reserve \u2014 Will he succeed in ending its independence for good?Public health under siege \u2014 Can states hold the line as Trump guts CDC and NIH?Bannon\u2019s 2026 authoritarian blueprint \u2014 Will voter intimidation, gerrymanders, and election denial propaganda lock in GOP power, or will courts and voters be able to stop it?America\u2019s alliances unraveling \u2014 Will U.S. allies stop sharing intelligence as Trump and Gabbard cut off intel-sharing to them?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession. Prices are spiking and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Weaponized Immigration \u2014 Trump has turned ICE into a political enforcer, targeting Dreamers, visa holders, and even U.S. citizens.Public Health Collapse \u2014 With mass purges and gutted grants, Trump is dismantling CDC, NIH, and FDA, leaving Americans unprotected and in danger.Authoritarian Blueprint \u2014 MAGA\u2019s 2026 playbook fuses voter suppression, gerrymandering, and intimidation to try and rig elections in advance.Federal Capture \u2014 From U.S. attorneys to the Fed, Trump is stacking institutions with loyalists, shredding constitutional checks.Cultural Control \u2014 Trump is turning museums, schools, and media into propaganda tools, erasing history and silencing dissent.Global Isolation \u2014 By cutting intel to allies and showing fealty to Putin, Trump is dismantling America\u2019s alliances while empowering Russia.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Budget head Russell Vought has allocated just $2.9 billion, despite bipartisan backing and a legal requirement to disburse funds.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Slashing PEPFAR cripples one of America\\u2019s most successful global health programs, jeopardizing treatment for millions abroad while eroding U.S. leadership.
