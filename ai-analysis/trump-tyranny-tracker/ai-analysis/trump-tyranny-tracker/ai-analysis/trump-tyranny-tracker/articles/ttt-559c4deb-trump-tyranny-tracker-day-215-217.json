Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 22-24Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: Zoom Zoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsInside the Memphis Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Push for Elon Musk\u2019s xAI Data CenterWhat Happened: The Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce mounted an aggressive campaign to promote Musk\u2019s $12 billion xAI data center, including mailers with misleading claims about oversight. Residents fear emissions from gas turbines will worsen already high asthma rates.Why It Matters: The chamber\u2019s push reveals corruption in how corporate interests override community health and transparency. Residents had no voice, while environmental and public health risks were buried to rush through Musk\u2019s project.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump says U.S. government taking a 10% stake in tech giant IntelWhat Happened: Trump announced the U.S. government is taking a 10% stake in Intel, converting $8.9 billion in grants into equity. The deal makes Washington one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders.Why It Matters: This erases the line between public and private power, giving Trump direct leverage over a major tech firm. It is a shift toward state-controlled capitalism, politicizing corporate decisions and putting the future of free enterprise\u2014and the independence of the semiconductor industry\u2014at risk.Source: CBS NewsTrump says he'll fire Fed's Cook if she doesn't resign over \u201cmortgage questions\u201dWhat Happened: Trump threatened to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing disputed mortgage filings, after she refused to resign. Cook\u2014the first Black woman on the Fed board\u2014called it bullying, while Democrats said Trump is using it as a pretext to replace her with loyalists.Why It Matters: The move escalates Trump\u2019s bid to take over another independent institution, undermining the Fed\u2019s role in guiding U.S. monetary policy. By targeting Cook, he\u2019s warning that dissenting voices will be purged and replaced with political enforcers.Source: ReutersHow Trump Used 10 Emergency Declarations to Justify Hundreds of ActionsWhat Happened: In seven months, Trump has declared 9 national emergencies plus a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d in D.C., using them to militarize the border, impose sweeping tariffs, sanction the ICC, keep coal plants running, and seize control of D.C.\u2019s police.Why It Matters: Trump is ruling by permanent emergency, sidestepping Congress to grab unchecked power. It sets a dangerous precedent that guts democratic safeguards and hands the presidency authoritarian control.Source: New York TimesPentagon Plans Military Deployment in Chicago as Trump Eyes \u201cCrackdown\u201dWhat Happened: The Pentagon is preparing to send thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago as soon as September, with active-duty forces also discussed, as Trump extends his federal takeovers from D.C. and Los Angeles. The operation would target crime, homelessness, and undocumented immigration, despite opposition from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who call it unconstitutional and unnecessary given falling crime rates.Why It Matters: This is a major escalation of Trump\u2019s police-state tactics, bypassing state authority under Title 10 and edging toward the Insurrection Act. It paves the way for federal occupations of Democratic-led cities, inflaming tensions and shredding constitutional limits.Source: Washington PostTrump threatens to send National Guard troops to BaltimoreWhat Happened: Trump threatened to send the National Guard into Baltimore, calling the city \u201cout of control\u201d after Gov. Wes Moore invited him to tour with local officials. Moore pushed back, citing Baltimore\u2019s lowest homicide rate in 50 years, while Mayor Brandon Scott demanded investments in community programs and gun control instead of militarization. Trump also warned he might withhold funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating his use of federal forces against Democratic-led cities, even as crime declines. By tying disaster aid to political compliance, he\u2019s using coercion as leverage\u2014an authoritarian abuse of power that undermines state and local authority.Source: Washington PostTrump Eyes National Guard Expansion Into New York, ChicagoWhat Happened: Trump said he\u2019s preparing to expand National Guard deployments into New York and Chicago after taking control of D.C.\u2019s police force and sending 2,000 troops into the capital. Local leaders blasted the plan, noting crime is already declining \u2014 with Chicago murders down 32% this year \u2014 and warning it would inflame tensions.Why It Matters: Trump is conditioning Americans to accept troops in the streets by testing federal takeovers of city policing. By painting Democratic-led cities as war zones, he\u2019s normalizing military crackdowns, overriding local authority, and laying the groundwork for control.Source: BloombergTrump repeatedly pointed a finger at Bolton in the days before raidsWhat Happened: Days before FBI agents raided John Bolton\u2019s home and office, Trump attacked his former national security adviser over Bolton\u2019s harsh critiques of his Russia policy. Officials deny Trump ordered the raids, but the timing raised alarms since Trump has openly vowed to wield law enforcement against his enemies.Why It Matters: The Bolton raid shows Trump continues weaponizing the justice system to go after critics. Even if prosecutors say it\u2019s about classified files, the timing makes it clear he\u2019s using law enforcement as a tool of retribution\u2014just like in Russia\u2014shredding trust in independent justice.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsNational Guard Patrols Begin to Carry Weapons in D.C.What Happened: National Guard troops deployed under Trump\u2019s D.C. crackdown began openly carrying firearms Sunday evening, following authorization from Pete Hegseth. More than 2,200 troops are now stationed in the city, \u201cassisting\u201d police at transit hubs and patrolling neighborhoods.Why It Matters: Arming Guard troops escalates Trump\u2019s takeover of D.C., normalizing soldiers policing civilians. It\u2019s a step toward a full-blown police state, with Washington serving as the test case for military rule at home.Source: New York TimesFBI Raids Home of Former Trump National Security Adviser John BoltonWhat Happened: The FBI searched former Trump national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s Maryland home and Washington office in a probe over \u201cclassified information.\u201d The raid revives a Trump-era case tied to Bolton\u2019s memoir, which was highly critical of Trump, and comes amid a broader campaign targeting his political enemies.Why It Matters: Trump is openly weaponizing the DOJ and FBI to go after critics, reviving dead cases to settle scores. By raiding a former top adviser turned opponent, he\u2019s warning insiders that dissent will be crushed with state retribution.Source: Wall Street Journal and New York TimesKash Patel posts cryptic message amid Bolton raidWhat Happened: FBI Director Kash Patel posted \u201cNO ONE is above the law\u201d as agents raided the Maryland home of John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and sharp critic. Officials cited classified files, while Deputy Director Dan Bongino and VP JD Vance amplified Patel\u2019s post, framing it as a corruption probe.Why It Matters: An FBI director politicizing an active raid is unprecedented and dangerous, showing how far Trump has gone in weaponizing federal agencies to target his enemies. Source: The HillTulsi Gabbard announces plans to cut intelligence staff by halfWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard announced plans to purge the ODNI workforce by nearly half and reduce its budget by $700 million. She also gutted units monitoring foreign influence, WMDs, and cyber threats, and revoked security clearances for 37 current and former officials, accusing them, without evidence, of \u201cpoliticizing intelligence.\u201dWhy It Matters: Gutting intelligence and silencing critics weakens America\u2019s defenses while consolidating Trump\u2019s control of national security. By dismantling oversight, Gabbard is deliberately stripping away safeguards against adversaries like Russia\u2014yet another gift to the Kremlin.Source: BBC NewsSupreme Court clears way for Trump admin. to cancel NIH grants related to diversity, gender identityWhat Happened: The Supreme Court allowed Trump officials to cancel more than 1,700 NIH research grants tied to diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender identity. The ruling lifted a lower court order that had forced NIH to restore the grants, though legal challenges continue in lower courts.Why It Matters: This greenlights Trump\u2019s purge of federally funded research on DEI and gender identity, gutting projects at top universities and labs. It rips resources from public health and medical research to enforce an ideological agenda, undermining scientific independence and chilling vital fields of study.Source: CBS NewsJustice Department gave Ghislaine Maxwell 'a platform to rewrite history,' family of Epstein accuser saysWhat Happened: The Justice Department released transcripts of a two-day interview between Ghislaine Maxwell and Deputy AG Todd Blanche, where Maxwell \u201cdisputed\u201d her trafficking conviction and cast doubt on Virginia Giuffre\u2019s allegations. Giuffre\u2019s family said the move gave Maxwell \u201ca platform to rewrite history\u201d and invalidated the experiences of survivors.Why It Matters: The DOJ is giving a convicted monster and sex trafficker a platform to rewrite her and Epstein\u2019s hideous crimes against children while hinting at a pardon. It whitewashes abuse, betrays survivors, and turns justice into a propaganda stunt for Trump\u2019s allies.Source: NBC NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUS Accuses George Mason University of Violating Civil Rights LawWhat Happened: Trump officials accused George Mason University of \u201cbreaking\u201d federal anti-discrimination law by using race in hiring and promotion practices under its DEI policies. The Education Department gave GMU 10 days to resolve the issue, demanding that President Gregory Washington personally apologize and clarify hiring policies.Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing federal funding to attack universities. By threatening universities with cuts and fines, he\u2019s sending a message: embrace diversity and you\u2019ll be punished. It\u2019s a push to roll back civil rights gains and impose ideological conformity on campuses nationwide.Source: BloombergSpanish-Language Reporter Detained by Trump Administration Sues for ReleaseWhat Happened: Mario Guevara, a Georgia-based journalist who covers immigration, was arrested in June while filming a protest against Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Local charges were dismissed, but he remains in federal custody after ICE appealed his bond, despite his lawyers saying he has legal work authorization.Why It Matters: Guevara\u2019s detention is being condemned by press freedom groups and the ACLU as retaliation against a journalist critical of Trump\u2019s policies. His case highlights growing fears that the regime is weaponizing immigration law to silence reporters.Source: The HillAs Trump Targets the Smithsonian, Museums Across the U.S. Feel a ChillWhat Happened: Trump ordered reviews of Smithsonian exhibitions, prompting cancellations and changes at museums nationwide. Shows featuring Black and LGBTQ artists were postponed or dropped, with curators citing fears of political retaliation.Why It Matters: The pressure has created a climate of quiet censorship, pushing museums to self-censor and silencing marginalized voices.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE director says agents won't be at D.C. schools on the first day \u2014 but may be going forwardWhat Happened: Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said agents won\u2019t be present at D.C. schools on the first day of classes but left open future visits under \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d like welfare checks or emergencies. The rollback of ICE\u2019s sensitive-locations policy has already fueled fear and student absences.Why It Matters: Leaving the door open for ICE in schools turns classrooms into surveillance zones. It shatters trust in education as a safe space, puts fear in immigrant families, and traumatizes kids who may stop showing up to school altogether.Source: NBC NewsAbrego Garcia\u2019s Lawyers Accuse Administration of Seeking to \u2018Coerce\u2019 PleaWhat Happened: Lawyers for Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, wrongfully disappeared earlier this year, say Trump officials threatened to re-deport him to Uganda unless he pled guilty to human smuggling charges. They claim prosecutors first offered Costa Rica as a safe destination if he accepted a plea, then shifted to Uganda when he refused.Why It Matters: Coercion is the new policy. Trump\u2019s regime is using deportation threats to strong-arm legal outcomes, turning immigration courts into tools of retaliation and abuse of power.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth fires head of Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey KruseWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, after the DIA issued an assessment contradicting Trump\u2019s claim that U.S. strikes had \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Kruse\u2019s ouster is part of a broader purge of senior military and intelligence leaders who\u2019ve issued analyses at odds with the White House narrative.Why It Matters: This is more political retribution. By punishing leaders for fact-based intelligence, Trump and Hegseth are bending security agencies to their propaganda, silencing dissent, and endangering America\u2019s ability to assess real threats.Source: Washington PostHomeland Security Tells Watchdog It Hasn\u2019t Kept Text Message Data Since AprilWhat Happened: DHS told watchdog group American Oversight it hasn\u2019t kept text messages from top officials since April, denying FOIA requests tied to the Los Angeles National Guard deployment and Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d migrant internment camp. The agency later reversed itself, claiming records are preserved but without explaining the contradiction.Why It Matters: If DHS is failing to preserve texts, it\u2019s a clear violation of the Federal Records Act and a repeat of scandals like the erased Jan. 6 Secret Service messages. Erasing or concealing internal communications guts transparency, blocks accountability, and hides government misconduct.Source: New York TimesWhite House cancels union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workersWhat Happened: After a court lifted an injunction, Trump voided union contracts at the VA, EPA, and Agriculture Department\u2014part of an executive order canceling collective bargaining agreements for most federal employees. The move affects about 400,000 workers, with the White House citing \u201cnational security\u201d to justify stripping away rights.Why It Matters: This is the largest attack on public-sector unions in U.S. history. By gutting worker protections at agencies serving veterans, farmers, and the environment, Trump is testing a blueprint to crush organized labor across the country.Source: The GuardianAlarm over Fema aid rule requiring email address for disaster victimsWhat Happened: FEMA is now requiring disaster victims to provide an email address to apply for federal aid. Officials claim it will streamline communication, but critics warn it excludes elderly, disabled, rural, and low-income Americans without internet access\u2014especially since FEMA has ended door-to-door outreach and closed field offices.Why It Matters: This rule will block the most vulnerable survivors from getting food, shelter, and medicine when they need them most. Coupled with mass FEMA cuts, it shows the Trump regime is making disaster relief harder to access.Source: The GuardianCovid Vaccine Opponent Tapped to Lead Federal Review TeamWhat Happened: RFK Jr. appointed MIT professor Retsef Levi, a vocal critic of Covid vaccines, to lead a CDC task force reviewing vaccine safety. Levi has called the shots \u201cthe most failing medical product\u201d and previously urged they be pulled from the market.Why It Matters: Trump put another vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist in charge of vaccine safety, fueling junk \u201cscience\u201d and disinformation. It escalates his war on vaccines, guts CDC credibility, and puts countless lives at risk.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchDOGE Targeted Him on Social Media.Then the Taliban Took His Family.What Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE publicly named Afghan scholar Mohammad Halimi as a supposed Taliban-linked contractor, despite records proving his U.S.-funded work opposed the group. Within days, Taliban intelligence detained and beat members of his family in Kabul.Why It Matters: This outrageous and reckless smear not only endangered Halimi\u2019s relatives but also undermined U.S. credibility abroad. By weaponizing lies of \u201cwaste and fraud,\u201d Musk\u2019s agency blurred oversight with political theater\u2014leaving real people to pay the price.Source: ProPublicaFrance Summons US Envoy Over Antisemitism AllegationsWhat Happened: France summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he accused President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government of \u201cfailing to confront\u201d rising antisemitism. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kushner said he was writing \u201cout of deep concern\u201d about the surge, but France called his allegations \u201cunacceptable\u201d interference in its internal affairs.Why It Matters: By acting like a political operative instead of a diplomat, Kushner is weakening trust with a key ally and further eroding U.S.\u2013French relations.Source: BloombergTrump Nominates Personnel Aide Sergio Gor as Ambassador to IndiaWhat Happened: Trump nominated Sergio Gor, his presidential personnel chief and longtime political operative, as ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asia. Gor, a close ally with little direct India experience, oversaw the hiring of thousands of Trump loyalists across the government.Why It Matters: Gor isn\u2019t even his real name, and he lied about his background\u2014yet Trump is handing him one of America\u2019s most critical diplomatic posts. A man who\u2019s never been vetted will shape U.S. policy with India. It\u2019s loyalty over competence, and it puts national security at risk.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchVance says Russia has made 'significant concessions' on UkraineWhat Happened: JD Vance said Russia has shown new \u201cflexibility\u201d in talks, acknowledging Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and abandoning demands for a puppet regime in Kyiv. He didn\u2019t rule out further sanctions but insisted that Trump is engaging with the Kremlin in \u201cgood faith,\u201d even as Moscow rejected a ceasefire.Why It Matters: Calling Russia\u2019s empty rhetoric \u201cconcessions\u201d whitewashes ongoing genocidal aggression while bombs still fall on Ukraine. If Putin wanted peace, he\u2019d pull his army out\u2014anything less is just stringing the U.S. along.Source: ABC NewsTrump shows off photograph Putin sent him of their Alaska summitWhat Happened: Trump showed off a framed photograph Putin sent him from their Alaska summit, calling it a \u201cnice picture\u201d of the Russian thug. The Oval Office stunt came as Moscow rejected Trump\u2019s push for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, with Lavrov dismissing NATO talks on Ukraine\u2019s security guarantees as \u201cfutile.\u201dWhy It Matters: Flaunting a keepsake from Putin while Russia wages genocidal war reveals Trump\u2019s sick obsession with a war criminal. U.S. diplomacy is being warped around his fealty to Putin.Source: ABC NewsTrump says Putin may attend North America\u2019s FIFA World CupWhat Happened: Trump suggested Putin could attend the 2026 World Cup in North America, saying, \u201che may be coming, he may not, depending on what happens.\u201d He added that he had spoken to Putin about a recent Russian strike on a U.S. factory in Ukraine.Why It Matters: Floating an invite for Putin to a U.S.-hosted World Cup further normalizes a genocidal thug and war criminal. It underscores Trump\u2019s sick coziness with Moscow even as America\u2019s allies work to isolate Russia.Source: The HillIn Trump\u2019s Second Term, Far-Right Agenda Enters the MainstreamWhat Happened: Seven months into his second term, Trump has woven far-right propaganda into White House policy, from mass immigration crackdowns framed as an \u201cinvasion\u201d to dismantling DEI programs. Once-fringe extremists like Enrique Tarrio and Augustus Sol Invictus now hail their ideas as mainstream, while far-right hires with racist and antisemitic histories have landed key posts.Why It Matters: Trump is fusing extremist rhetoric with government power, turning white nationalist narratives into official policy. By hardwiring the far right into federal governance, he\u2019s institutionalizing extremism at the heart of the U.S. government.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Announces Furniture Imports Probe, Setting Up TariffsWhat Happened: Trump announced a federal probe into foreign furniture imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, signaling new tariffs \u201cat a rate yet to be determined.\u201d He said the move would \u201crevitalize domestic furniture makers.\u201d Why It Matters: Trump is expanding his erratic tariffs into consumer goods, threatening higher prices for households and rattling markets. It shows how he wields national security law as cover.Source: BloombergHome purchases are getting canceled at a record rate: RedfinWhat Happened: More than 15% of U.S. home purchases fell through in July \u2014 about 58,000 canceled contracts \u2014 the highest July rate since Redfin began tracking in 2017. Texas and Florida led the surge, with San Antonio topping the list, followed by Fort Lauderdale and Jacksonville.Why It Matters: The spike in failed sales shows how record prices, high mortgage rates, and economic uncertainty are reshaping housing. Homes are sitting longer, sellers are conceding, and buyers are regaining leverage.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Rep. Elise Stefanik Booed, Heckled at NY EventWhat Happened: Rep. Elise Stefanik was loudly booed and heckled while attending a memorial event in Plattsburgh, New York, honoring a local politician. Attendees shouted over her remarks, reflecting growing local frustration with the Trump cronie.Source: ABC NewsJudge blocks Trump from cutting funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities, including Los Angeles and ChicagoWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump from cutting off funding to dozens of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d expanding an earlier ruling that found his order unconstitutional. The decision protects major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and Denver, which have laws limiting cooperation with ICE.Source: CBS NewsCalifornia lawmakers swiftly pass, governor signs, Democrats' redistricting planWhat Happened: California Democrats fast-tracked and passed a redistricting plan that would give them five more congressional seats, directly countering a Trump-backed GOP map in Texas designed to flip seats Republican. Governor Gavin Newsom quickly signed the plan, sending it to voters in November for approval.Source: ReutersJudge blocks Trump administration from expanding Florida's \"Alligator Alcatraz\" over environmental concernsWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked Trump and Florida officials from expanding the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" immigration internment camp in the Everglades, citing environmental threats to endangered species and water supplies. The order halts new construction and bars the transfer of additional detainees.Source: CBS NewsPennsylvania rejects DOJ request for voter rolls with personal dataWhat Happened: Pennsylvania election chief Al Schmidt denied a Justice Department request for sensitive voter data, including Social Security and driver\u2019s license numbers. He offered instead a public version of the rolls but said state law prohibits releasing private identifiers.

Prices are spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. State-Capitalism Creep: Converting subsidies into equity at Intel blurs public\u2013private lines and politicizes corporate decisions\u2014just like in Russia.Emergency Rule: Trump is ruling by \u201cemergency declaration,\u201d sidestepping Congress and concentrating power in the presidency.Conditioning Americans: Guard deployments and armed patrols in D.C.\u2014with Chicago/Baltimore floated\u2014condition the public to soldiers in the streets.Institutions As Weapons: Raids, politicized posts, and loyalist appointments show DOJ/FBI/Intel being leveraged against critics and watchdogs.Science & Academia Under Attack: Canceling DEI-linked NIH grants and pressuring universities and museums chills research and speech.Immigration As Coercion: Threats, school-site fear, and deportation leverage are being used to force legal outcomes and silence dissent.Economic Fallout Building: Tariff probes and protectionist shocks are rippling through retail and housing\u2014raising costs and causing economic volatility.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Residents fear emissions from gas turbines will worsen already high asthma rates.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The chamber\\u2019s push reveals corruption in how corporate interests override community health and transparency.

The deal makes Washington one of Intel\\u2019s largest shareholders.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This erases the line between public and private power, giving Trump direct leverage over a major tech firm.

Cook\\u2014the first Black woman on the Fed board\\u2014called it bullying, while Democrats said Trump is using it as a pretext to replace her with loyalists.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move escalates Trump\\u2019s bid to take over another independent institution, undermining the Fed\\u2019s role in guiding U.S. monetary policy.

The operation would target crime, homelessness, and undocumented immigration, despite opposition from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who call it unconstitutional and unnecessary given falling crime rates.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a major escalation of Trump\\u2019s police-state tactics, bypassing state authority under Title 10 and edging toward the Insurrection Act. It paves the way for federal occupations of Democratic-led cities, inflaming tensions and shredding constitutional limits.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/23/trump-chicago-military-national-guard/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump threatens to send National Guard troops to Baltimore</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump threatened to send the National Guard into Baltimore, calling the city \\u201Cout of control\\u201D after Gov. Wes Moore invited him to tour with local officials. Moore pushed back, citing Baltimore\\u2019s lowest homicide rate in 50 years, while Mayor Brandon Scott demanded investments in community programs and gun control instead of militarization. Trump also warned he might withhold funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is escalating his use of federal forces against Democratic-led cities, even as crime declines. By tying disaster aid to political compliance, he\\u2019s using coercion as leverage\\u2014an authoritarian abuse of power that undermines state and local authority.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/24/trump-baltimore-troops-wes-moore/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Eyes National Guard Expansion Into New York, Chicago</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump said he\\u2019s preparing to expand National Guard deployments into New York and Chicago after taking control of D.C.\\u2019s police force and sending 2,000 troops into the capital. Local leaders blasted the plan, noting crime is already declining \\u2014 with Chicago murders down 32% this year \\u2014 and warning it would inflame tensions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is conditioning Americans to accept troops in the streets by testing federal takeovers of city policing.

Officials deny Trump ordered the raids, but the timing raised alarms since Trump has openly vowed to wield law enforcement against his enemies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Bolton raid shows Trump continues weaponizing the justice system to go after critics. Even if prosecutors say it\\u2019s about classified files, the timing makes it clear he\\u2019s using law enforcement as a tool of retribution\\u2014just like in Russia\\u2014shredding trust in independent justice.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/23/trump-bolton-raid-retaliation-concerns/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>National Guard Patrols Begin to Carry Weapons in D.C.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> National Guard troops deployed under Trump\\u2019s D.C. crackdown began openly carrying firearms Sunday evening, following authorization from Pete Hegseth.

Officials cited classified files, while Deputy Director Dan Bongino and VP JD Vance amplified Patel\\u2019s post, framing it as a corruption probe.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> An FBI director politicizing an active raid is unprecedented and dangerous, showing how far Trump has gone in weaponizing federal agencies to target his enemies. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5465239-kash-patel-posts-cryptic-message-amid-bolton-raid/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Tulsi Gabbard announces plans to cut intelligence staff by half</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tulsi Gabbard announced plans to purge the ODNI workforce by nearly half and reduce its budget by $700 million. She also gutted units monitoring foreign influence, WMDs, and cyber threats, and revoked security clearances for 37 current and former officials, accusing them, without evidence, of \\u201Cpoliticizing intelligence.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Gutting intelligence and silencing critics weakens America\\u2019s defenses while consolidating Trump\\u2019s control of national security.

The ruling lifted a lower court order that had forced NIH to restore the grants, though legal challenges continue in lower courts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This greenlights Trump\\u2019s purge of federally funded research on DEI and gender identity, gutting projects at top universities and labs.

Giuffre\\u2019s family said the move gave Maxwell \\u201Ca platform to rewrite history\\u201D and invalidated the experiences of survivors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The DOJ is giving a convicted monster and sex trafficker a platform to rewrite her and Epstein\\u2019s hideous crimes against children while hinting at a pardon.

The Education Department gave GMU 10 days to resolve the issue, demanding that President Gregory Washington personally apologize and clarify hiring policies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues weaponizing federal funding to attack universities. By threatening universities with cuts and fines, he\\u2019s sending a message: embrace diversity and you\\u2019ll be punished.

The rollback of ICE\\u2019s sensitive-locations policy has already fueled fear and student absences.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Leaving the door open for ICE in schools turns classrooms into surveillance zones.

They claim prosecutors first offered Costa Rica as a safe destination if he accepted a plea, then shifted to Uganda when he refused.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Coercion is the new policy.

Kruse\\u2019s ouster is part of a broader purge of senior military and intelligence leaders who\\u2019ve issued analyses at odds with the White House narrative.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is more political retribution. By punishing leaders for fact-based intelligence, Trump and Hegseth are bending security agencies to their propaganda, silencing dissent, and endangering America\\u2019s ability to assess real threats.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/22/defense-intelligence-agency-kruse-fired-hegseth/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Homeland Security Tells Watchdog It Hasn\\u2019t Kept Text Message Data Since April</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> DHS told watchdog group American Oversight it hasn\\u2019t kept text messages from top officials since April, denying FOIA requests tied to the Los Angeles National Guard deployment and Florida\\u2019s \\u201CAlligator Alcatraz\\u201D migrant internment camp. The agency later reversed itself, claiming records are preserved but without explaining the contradiction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If DHS is failing to preserve texts, it\\u2019s a clear violation of the Federal Records Act and a repeat of scandals like the erased Jan. 6 Secret Service messages.
