  "content": "Demonstrators hold signs during a rally outside the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, D.C., on March 13, 2025. President Trump was sued by a group of mostly Democratic-led states over his alleged plan to effectively dismantle the Education Department by slashing its workforce in half. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 13Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Family in Talks for Binance Stake as Founder Seeks PardonWhat Happened: The Trump family has been negotiating a potential financial stake in Binance.US, the American arm of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the same time, Binance\u2019s founder, Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating anti-money-laundering laws, is pushing for a presidential pardon from Trump.Why It Matters: This raises serious ethical and legal concerns, as Trump\u2019s regime is actively rolling back crypto regulations while his family seeks to profit from the industry. A pardon for Zhao would allow Binance to fully re-enter the U.S. market and expand globally, benefiting both Trump\u2019s business interests and Binance\u2019s future.Source: Wall Street JournalFear and resignation after \u2018world\u2019s most powerful company\u2019 pays Trump a $100 billion \u2018protection fee\u2019What Happened: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\u2019s top chipmaker, announced a $100 billion investment in the U.S. at a White House event with Trump. The move was denounced in Taiwan as a \"protection fee\" paid under U.S. political pressure.Why It Matters: Taiwan sees TSMC as its \"silicon shield\" against China, making this investment a major national security concern. It weakens Taiwan\u2019s strategic leverage and could accelerate the U.S. pulling TSMC\u2019s operations out of Taiwan, further escalating regional tensions. Source: CNNErik Prince Reemerges in Trump\u2019s Inner Circle, Pushes Private Security for Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, has reentered Trump\u2019s regime, promoting private security solutions for mass deportations, counterterrorism, and securing foreign resources. He helped broker a deal with El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele to detain migrants with criminal records\u2014including U.S. citizens\u2014on behalf of Trump.Why It Matters: Erik Prince\u2019s return means more private contractors in law enforcement, intelligence, and military operations with no oversight. His history of human rights abuses and mercenary tactics makes this a dangerous shift with serious risks.Source: CNN\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDOGE Operatives Embedded Inside Social Security AdministrationWhat Happened: At least 10 Musk operatives have infiltrated the Social Security Administration, with access to sensitive personal and financial data. These operatives are listed as \"IT Specialists\" at SSA headquarters. Their presence raises alarms, as Musk has repeatedly called Social Security a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and lied that millions of 150-year-olds are fraudulently \u201creceiving\u201d benefits.Why It Matters: This is a major security and privacy risk\u2014as Musk positions to control and potentially dismantle Social Security under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201d Experts fear that data could be shared outside SSA or that system failures could disrupt benefits for millions of retirees and disabled Americans. This is a deliberate effort to undermine/dismantle the system from within.Source: WIREDIRS Chief Counsel Removed Amid DOGE Push for Taxpayer DataWhat Happened: Trump is removing IRS top attorney William Paul amid internal debates over sharing confidential taxpayer data with other government agencies. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s operatives are pressuring the IRS to loosen taxpayer privacy protections.Why It Matters: This is blatant politicization of the IRS and a breach of taxpayer confidentiality\u2014 as Musk pushes for expanded data-sharing. With 18,000 IRS jobs set to be cut by May, tax enforcement and services will be severely compromised, threatening financial privacy and the agency\u2019s ability to function.Source: ABC NewsTrump Asks Supreme Court to Strip Judges\u2019 Power to Block His PoliciesWhat Happened: Trump filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, urging justices to curb lower courts\u2019 power to issue nationwide injunctions\u2014a key tool used to block his extremist policies, including his attempt to end birthright citizenship.Why It Matters: If the Supreme Court backs Trump, it would gut judicial oversight, letting him steamroll DEI programs, federal medical research, illegal federal purges, and immigration policies with no legal pushback. His agenda would face almost no resistance.Source: PoliticoInside Musk\u2019s \u2018Digital Coup\u2019What Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE has infiltrated dozens of federal agencies, pushing out thousands of civil servants and gaining access to millions of Americans\u2019 sensitive data. Musk operatives are rewriting federal systems, slashing budgets, and centralizing power. Their next move? Deploy AI-driven surveillance and automation to reshape the government.Why It Matters: This is a digital coup\u2014an unelected billionaire is using Trump\u2019s regime to hijack federal systems, weaponize data, and dismantle oversight. Musk\u2019s control over Social Security, tax records, and intelligence files threatens privacy and national security.Source: WIREDTop Justice Dept. Nominee Deleted 4,000 Tweets Containing Fringe ViewsWhat Happened: Aaron Reitz, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Policy, has deleted over 4,000 tweets ahead of his confirmation vote. His past posts include suggestions that court orders can be ignored, praise for Joseph McCarthy, and false claims about the 2020 election. Why It Matters: The Office of Legal Policy shapes Justice Department priorities and helps select federal judges. Reitz\u2019s past statements highlight a willingness to defy legal norms, raising serious concerns about his influence in the DOJ. His deleted tweets further highlight attempts to obscure extreme views before assuming office.Source: CBS NewsMusk Visits NSA After Calling for \u2018Overhaul\u2019 of U.S. Cyberespionage HubWhat Happened: Musk made an unannounced visit to the National Security Agency, meeting with its chief just days after calling for an \u201coverhaul\u201d of the agency on social media. This is Musk\u2019s first known visit to a U.S. intelligence agency.Why It Matters: The NSA is a core pillar of U.S. intelligence, vital for cyber defense and surveillance. Musk\u2019s takeover of government agencies suggests the NSA could be gutted next. His reckless, secretive approach threatens national security and puts America\u2019s intelligence operations in danger.Source: NBC News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsFEMA Targets Migrant Shelters and Aid Groups What Happened: Trump is weaponizing FEMA and DHS to target shelters assisting migrants. FEMA has ordered grant recipients to turn over migrant records and sign sworn statements denying any knowledge of smuggling. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors subpoenaed NYC homeless shelters that house migrants, demanding personal data on residents.Why It Matters: This is a clear escalation in Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration, using federal agencies to intimidate humanitarian organizations and criminalize aid. Targeting migrant shelters with smuggling laws is a dangerous abuse of power meant to discourage organizations from helping vulnerable people.Source: Associated PressUSPS to Cut 10,000 Jobs Through Early Retirement ProgramWhat Happened: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy informed Congress that the U.S. Postal Service will cut 10,000 jobs through a voluntary early retirement program over the next 30 days. DeJoy also confirmed that Musk is now involved in USPS operations.Why It Matters: USPS cuts will hit rural communities, delay mail, and hurt workers. DeJoy's attack on the Postal Regulatory Commission signals a push to gut oversight, paving the way for privatization and chaos in mail service.Source: CBS News'Highly unusual': White House halts FBI background checks for senior staff, shifts them to PentagonWhat Happened: Trump's White House ordered the FBI to stop conducting background checks on senior staff, transferring the process to the Pentagon instead. The move came after White House officials deemed FBI vetting \"too intrusive.\"Why It Matters: This shift weakens the oversight of top officials and raises major national security concerns. The Pentagon is not traditionally responsible for vetting White House personnel, making this an unprecedented power play to bypass the FBI.Source: ABC NewsTrump Moves to Slash IRS Workforce by Nearly 20%What Happened: Musk is proposing massive cuts to the IRS, eliminating nearly 20% of its workforce by May 15\u2014just one month after Tax Day. The latest round of layoffs would terminate 6,800 employees, adding to the 6,700 probationary firings and 4,700 voluntary buyouts already executed.Why It Matters: Slashing the IRS cripples tax enforcement, cuts revenue, and guts customer service. Expect more tax cheats and fewer audits. Inside the agency, morale is collapsing\u2014fear, confusion, and chaos rule as critical staff get axed.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump to make rare visit to main Justice amid interference concernsWhat Happened: Trump will make a rare visit to the Justice Department, setting out his vision for the agency while surrounding himself with loyalists. His regime has pardoned January 6 rioters and insurrectionists, fired DOJ officials, halted civil rights litigation, and dropped corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams.Why It Matters: Presidents traditionally avoid direct involvement with the DOJ to maintain its independence. Trump, however, is actively reshaping the agency to serve his dangerous agenda, consolidating power, and using it as a tool for retribution rather than justice. This is not normal.Source: PoliticoTrump Defies Court Order on Anti-DEI PolicyWhat Happened: Federal agencies are ignoring a judge\u2019s order blocking Trump\u2019s ban on DEI programs for federal contractors. Despite the ruling, agencies are still threatening contractors with loss of funding if they refuse anti-DEI clauses.Why It Matters: This blatant defiance of the courts signals unchecked executive overreach and the regime\u2019s war on the rule of law. Source: ReutersTrump Issues Demands to Columbia to Restore Federal FundingWhat Happened: Trump cut $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing failure to combat antisemitism. To reinstate funding, Columbia must ban masks, give more power to campus police, limit protests, and overhaul its admissions process.Why It Matters: This is a federal takeover of university governance, crushing dissent under the guise of \u201csafety.\u201d Stripping faculty control and placing departments under government oversight is authoritarian overreach. Today, it\u2019s pro-Palestinian activists\u2014tomorrow, anyone who opposes Trump. Free speech and due process are on the chopping block.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE Surveillance Contractor Monitors 200+ Websites for GovernmentWhat Happened: A leaked list reveals that ICE contractor ShadowDragon is monitoring data from over 200 websites\u2014including Bluesky, OnlyFans, and Meta platforms\u2014to help government analysts track individuals\u2019 online activity. The software, SocialNet, maps out people\u2019s movements, relationships, and social media interactions. This comes amid ICE\u2019s detention of Columbia protester Mahmoud Khalil and reports that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is launching an AI-driven effort to monitor foreign nationals' social media for perceived support of Hamas or other groups.Why It Matters: The U.S. government is ramping up AI-driven surveillance on activists, immigrants, and foreign nationals, echoing tactics used in Russia. This expansion threatens privacy, civil liberties, and free speech as Trump\u2019s regime escalates its crackdown on dissent.Source: 404 MediaTrump Pushes Supreme Court to Restrict Birthright CitizenshipWhat Happened: Trump filed an emergency appeal asking the Supreme Court to allow the denial of citizenship to babies born in the U.S. to undocumented parents after February 19. The policy, blocked by federal judges in multiple states, challenges the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move would gut a core principle of the Constitution, stripping citizenship from American-born children and creating a permanent stateless underclass. Legal experts warn this could force every American to prove their citizenship, shredding centuries of legal precedent and redefining who counts as American.Source: Associated PressArlington Cemetery Website Erases Black, Hispanic, and Women Veterans' HistoriesWhat Happened: Arlington National Cemetery has removed online references to Black, Hispanic, and women veterans, along with educational materials on Medal of Honor recipients and self-guided walking tours of notable graves. Officials confirmed the deletions were made to comply with Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s orders targeting race and gender-related policies in the military.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate attempt to rewrite history and whitewash America\u2019s past\u2014an outright erasure of minority service members and war heroes from public memory. Source: Task & PurposeTrump to Invoke Wartime Alien Enemies Act for Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump is expected to invoke the Alien Enemies Act as early as Friday, a wartime law allowing the detention or deportation of individuals from enemy nations. This would enable the regime to deport some migrants without hearings. The law, last used during World War II, was previously cited to justify the internment of Japanese immigrants.Why It Matters: Trump is using obscure wartime laws to justify mass deportations, bypassing due process and immigration courts. This sets a dangerous precedent\u2014today, it's immigrants, but tomorrow, it could be used to crush dissent and expand authoritarian control under the guise of national emergencies.Source: ABC NewsNorth Dakota Moves to Challenge Same-Sex Marriage RulingWhat Happened: North Dakota lawmakers are close to passing a resolution urging the Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. The measure, which holds no legal power, follows similar efforts in Idaho and other states but faces strong opposition.Why It Matters: This is part of a broader conservative extremist push to roll back LGBTQ rights despite federal protections passed in 2022. Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s DOT Layoffs Threaten Transportation SafetyWhat Happened: Trump fired 788 DOT employees, including experts on highway deaths, pipeline safety, and vehicle recalls, as part of mass agency layoffs. The cuts hit safety-critical roles despite regime claims that public safety remains intact.Why It Matters: These firings will weaken oversight on dangerous roads, faulty vehicles, and hazardous pipelines, further endangering a rising highway death toll. The purge puts American lives at risk while favoring corporate deregulation.Source: PoliticoNASA, Yale, and Stanford Scientists Consider 'Scientific Exile' in FranceWhat Happened: Aix Marseille University, France\u2019s largest university, is expanding its \"Safe Place for Science\" program after receiving overwhelming interest from U.S. scientists fearing censorship under the Trump regime. Researchers from NASA, Yale, Stanford, NIH, and other major institutions are considering relocating to France due to Trump's executive orders restricting research funding and banning certain topics, including climate change, gender, race, and equity. The program will initially fund 15 scientists with \u20ac15 million and aims to expand across Europe.Why It Matters: The U.S. faces a new brain drain as leading scientists flee government censorship and funding cuts. Trump\u2019s assault on science is driving top researchers abroad, weakening America\u2019s global leadership in climate, health, and astrophysics.Source: 404 MediaTrump\u2019s Federal Cuts Push Universities Into Hiring Freezes and LayoffsWhat Happened: Universities across the U.S. are implementing hiring freezes and staff layoffs as Trump\u2019s regime slashes federal funding. Johns Hopkins University announced 2,200 job cuts after losing USAID funding. Research institutions are bracing for deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants, which could reduce funding by over $100 million. Why It Matters: The education sector, a major job creator, is now at risk of widespread layoffs and halted research projects. Universities are tightening budgets, freezing hiring, and cutting programs, which will stifle scientific progress and economic growth. Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Moves to Take Control of Panama CanalWhat Happened: Trump ordered the military to draft plans for increasing U.S. control over the Panama Canal, including deploying troops or, in extreme cases, seizing it by force. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal risks set the stage for a diplomatic crisis with Panama. The canal\u2019s neutrality is protected by law, and any U.S. attempt to seize control would trigger a global backlash. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's upcoming visit signals escalating tensions.Source: NBC NewsGreenland\u2019s Likely New PM Rejects Trump\u2019s Takeover PushWhat Happened: Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland\u2019s probable new prime minister, firmly rejected Trump\u2019s push to annex the island, stating Greenlanders want independence\u2014not U.S. or Danish control. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s repeated threats to annex Greenland face strong resistance as the island moves toward self-rule. Greenland\u2019s leaders are united in opposition, sending a clear message that Trump\u2019s imperialist ambitions are unwelcome.Source: The GuardianTrump Pushes Greenland Annexation, Prime Minister Says \u2018Enough is Enough\u2019What Happened: Trump doubled down on plans to annex Greenland, saying at a White House briefing, \u201cI think it will happen\u201d, citing international security concerns. Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute Egede immediately condemned the statement and called an emergency meeting of party leaders to strengthen their rejection.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s imperialist rhetoric mirrors Putin\u2019s bloody territorial ambitions, attempting to seize control of Greenland against the will of its people. Greenland and Denmark's leaders unanimously oppose U.S. annexation, but Trump\u2019s obsession with the Arctic raises concerns about future military action or economic pressure.Source: CNNTrump Suggests U.S. Should Annex Canada in Bizarre Press ConferenceWhat Happened: During an Oval Office press conference with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump again claimed that Canada \"only works\" as a U.S. state and floated the idea of invading and annexing the country.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s comments\u2014directed at a founding NATO member and close U.S. ally\u2014are meant to destroy alliances and fuel diplomatic tensions. His rhetoric aligns with the authoritarian land-grab tactics seen in Russia\u2019s approach, sparking concern among U.S. allies and NATO leaders.Source: Fox News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPutin Stalls Ceasefire Talks, Trump Expected to Push Russia\u2019s AgendaWhat Happened: Putin claimed to \u201csupport\u201d a \u201cceasefire\u201d but loaded the proposal with demands, including recognition of illegally occupied territories, a NATO ban for Ukraine, and restrictions on military aid. He also suggested discussing the matter directly with Trump.Why It Matters: Putin is playing for time while continuing a genocidal war of aggression. Trump will continue to push Russia\u2019s agenda, attempting to pressure Ukraine into major concessions that benefit the Kremlin rather than secure a just peace.Source: Politico\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsS&P 500 Slips Into Correction as Stagflation Fears and Trump Tariff Threats Shake MarketsWhat Happened: The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, officially entering correction territory after dropping more than 10% from its February all-time high. The index has erased all post-election gains, with major companies like Tesla, Walmart, and Amazon suffering sharp declines.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff threats and economic policies are rattling markets, fueling concerns about stagflation\u2014a toxic mix of high inflation and slow growth. Investors fear a prolonged downturn as Trump's insane trade war escalates, driving up costs and destabilizing global trade. Source: NBC NewsJohns Hopkins to Cut 2,000 Jobs After Trump Slashes USAID FundingWhat Happened: Johns Hopkins University is eliminating over 2,000 jobs after Trump cut $800 million in USAID funding, crippling its public health and international programs. This is the largest layoff in the university\u2019s history and affects domestic and international staff across 44 countries.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk\u2019s push to dismantle USAID is gutting global health initiatives and research, with massive job losses in academia. Johns Hopkins, a leader in federal research funding, is the latest casualty of Trump\u2019s war on higher education and scientific research.Source: The GuardianTrump Threatens 200% Tariff on European Wine in Retaliation for EU Whiskey TaxWhat Happened: Trump vowed to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne, and spirits after the EU announced plans for a 50% tax on American whiskey, a response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. The escalating trade war could triple the price of European alcohol in the U.S. and drive up bourbon prices in Europe. The EU has warned it will fight back, refusing to bow to Trump\u2019s threats.Why It Matters: This trade war is an attack on consumers and businesses, driving up costs for importers, distributors, and retailers, and will cause layoffs in the Kentucky Bourbon industry. Trump\u2019s reckless escalation is destabilizing global markets, forcing American businesses and consumers to pay the price.Source: Associated PressEU Retaliatory Tariffs Target Key U.S. Exports, Threatening State EconomiesWhat Happened: As Trump escalates his trade war with the EU, retaliatory tariffs will hit U.S. exports five times harder than the original Trump tariffs\u2014jumping from $6 billion to $27 billion in impacted goods. States like New York, North Dakota, and Iowa face some of the highest risks to their export markets.Why It Matters: With major industries bracing for losses, states dependent on exports will see massive job cuts and economic strain. Instead of strengthening American industry, Trump\u2019s policies are choking off key markets and fueling inflation for consumers at home.Source: CNBCTesla Warns Trump\u2019s Trade War Could Backfire on U.S. ManufacturersWhat Happened: Tesla quietly warned that retaliatory tariffs could harm its business, urging U.S. trade officials to consider the economic fallout of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies. The anonymous letter was sent to the U.S. Trade Representative.Why It Matters: Just days ago, Trump was literally selling Teslas on the White House lawn, posing with the cars and promising economic gains. Now, Tesla is signaling alarm over his tariffs, and the unsigned letter suggests internal dissent at Tesla.Source: CNN\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsVeterans Nationwide March: March 14, 2025Judge orders thousands of federal workers reinstated; slams \u2018sham\u2019 government declarationWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that Trump\u2019s mass firing of 20,000 probationary federal employees across 18 agencies was illegal, ordering their reinstatement. Judge James Bredar found that the regime failed to provide the required advance notice and misrepresented the firings as performance-based.Source: ABC NewsSecond Federal Judge Orders Trump to Reinstate Fired Government WorkersWhat Happened: A second federal judge has blocked Trump\u2019s mass firings of probationary federal workers, ruling that at least 24,000 employees were terminated without due process. U.S. District Judge James Bredar in Maryland found that the regime falsely claimed workers were fired for \u201cperformance\u201d reasons but had no individualized assessments.Source: CBS NewsHarvard Professors Sue Trump Over Censorship of LGBTQ ResearchWhat Happened: Two Harvard medical professors sued Trump after their LGBTQ-inclusive patient safety research was removed from a government website. The ACLU and Yale Law School are backing the lawsuit, arguing this violates their First Amendment rights.Source: NBC NewsJudge Blocks Trump\u2019s Retaliation Against Democratic Law FirmWhat Happened: A federal judge blocked key provisions of Trump\u2019s executive order targeting Perkins Coie, a Democratic-linked law firm. The order barred its attorneys from federal buildings and government dealings, aiming to cripple the firm.Source: PoliticoJudge Orders Musk, DOGE to Release Cost-Cutting RecordsWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered Musk and his operatives to turn over records detailing their federal budget cuts after 14 Democratic attorneys general sued, arguing Musk illegally wields government power without Senate confirmation.Source: ReutersFarmers Sue Trump Over Withheld IRA FundsWhat Happened: U.S. farmers and nonprofits sued Trump for illegally freezing USDA grants funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. The USDA halted funding for solar projects and conservation programs as part of a spending review.Source: Reuters'We are not happy': Protesters urge Rep. Edwards to oppose Trump changesWhat Happened: Dozens of demonstrators gathered in Black Mountain and Mills River, North Carolina, protesting Rep. Chuck Edwards\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s policies, particularly Musk\u2019s gutting of agencies and purging of federal employees. Protesters also voiced concerns over Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine and relations with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
