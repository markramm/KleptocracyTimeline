We won\u2019t let themCheck out our latest article in the new series Julie and I launched \u2026 New chapters drop on Mondays!Unmasking RussiaActive Measures: How the Kremlin Penetrated Fox News and Right-Wing Media Well in advance of the U.S. 2016 presidential election, the Kremlin employed a broad, coordinated influence operation across U.S. right-wing media. Its aim: to sow discord, promote Donald Trump, and damage Hillary Clinton\u2026Read more7 days ago \u00b7 83 likes \u00b7 8 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsNew crypto token boosts Trump family's wealth by $5 billionWhat Happened: The Trump family\u2019s World Liberty Financial launched a crypto token, WLFI, that, despite an early price drop, boosted their paper wealth by $5 billion. Trump and his sons hold 22.5 billion tokens as he advances pro-crypto policies from the White House.Why It Matters: Trump is regulating crypto while his family profits\u2014another case of blatant corruption. His presidency has become a personal enrichment scheme, merging public power with private gain.Source: CBS NewsPolitical spending tops $900K at Trump properties since inaugurationWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s second inauguration, political committees have spent more than $931,000 at his properties, with the RNC accounting for the majority. A quarter of House Republicans have directed campaign or PAC money to Trump businesses, while Trump himself has visited his resorts and clubs over 100 times this term.Why It Matters: Republicans are funneling donor money into Trump\u2019s pockets while abandoning oversight. By merging party operations with his business empire, Trump continues to use the presidency as a pay-to-play scheme for personal profit.Source: CREW\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsIce obtains access to Israeli-made spyware that can hack phones and encrypted appsWhat Happened: Trump lifted a hold on a $2 million contract with Israeli-founded Paragon Solutions, giving ICE access to Graphite, one of the world\u2019s most powerful spyware tools. The software can infiltrate any phone, bypass encryption on apps like WhatsApp and Signal, track movements, and even turn devices into listening bugs.Why It Matters: Giving ICE a cyberweapon built for dictatorships is a direct threat to every American\u2019s privacy and free speech. Immigrants are just the test case\u2014Trump is building a surveillance state that will soon target everyone.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s LA Troop Deployment Violated Federal Law, Judge SaysWhat Happened: A federal judge found Trump violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard troops and Marines for law enforcement duties in Los Angeles during protests over his immigration crackdown. The ruling blocks Trump from using federal troops for policing anywhere in California.Why It Matters: The decision is a major rebuke of Trump\u2019s effort to militarize LA and bypass legal limits on presidential power. The courts, for now, are a check on his authoritarian overreach, even as he vows to expand troop deployments to Democratic-led cities.Source: Bloomberg\u2018We\u2019re going in\u2019: Trump signals federal intervention in ChicagoWhat Happened: Trump announced \u201cwe\u2019re going in\u201d to Chicago, signaling plans to deploy National Guard troops despite opposition from Illinois officials. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson warned the move would amount to military occupation, while Trump doubled down with lies that Chicago is the \u201cMURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is inflating crime claims to justify militarizing Democratic-led cities, even after a court deemed his LA deployment illegal. Chicago will be the next step in erasing state authority and normalizing military invasions at home.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsPentagon Authorizes up to 600 Military Lawyers to Serve as Temporary Immigration JudgesWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth authorized up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, effectively doubling the current bench. The move follows mass purges of immigration judges and comes as Trump ramps up arrests and deportations amid a 3.5 million\u2013case backlog.Why It Matters: Deploying Pentagon lawyers into civilian courts blurs the line between military and judicial authority, raising concerns about due process and the militarization of immigration enforcement. Source: Military.comTrump administration blocks groups from voter registration at naturalization eventsWhat Happened: USCIS announced that nongovernmental groups, including the League of Women Voters, can no longer register new citizens to vote at naturalization ceremonies. Only state and local election officials will now be allowed to provide registration services.Why It Matters: The move makes it harder for new citizens to register, weakening decades of successful outreach. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to intimidate immigrants and suppress voters.Source: NPRUS to Offer $1,000 Bonuses to Police for Help Arresting MigrantsWhat Happened: Trump officials will pay state and local police up to $1,000 each quarter for meeting immigration arrest targets under ICE\u2019s 287(g) program. About 8,500 officers across 40 states are already deputized to enforce immigration law, with thousands more in training.Why It Matters: Trump has turned immigration enforcement into a bounty system, paying police to hunt migrants. Cash rewards will drive racial profiling, mass deportations, and destroy community trust in law enforcement.Source: BloombergSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsThe Fox-Trump feedback loop comes for Chicago. Troops may be next.What Happened: Despite Chicago recording its lowest shootings and murders in decades, Trump lied that it is the \u201cMURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\u201d after watching Fox & Friends portray the city as a \u201cwar zone.\u201d His rhetoric mirrors past false claims used to justify military deployments to blue cities.Why It Matters: Trump is laying the groundwork for sending troops into Chicago, not to fight crime but to expand control. Fox-driven propaganda\u2014mirroring Russian state TV pushing Kremlin agendas\u2014is spreading lies to prime viewers as Trump manufactures another crisis to justify military occupation of Democratic-led cities.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE is showing up to interview parents hoping to reunite with their children who entered US aloneWhat Happened: A new Trump directive requires parents hoping to reunite with children who crossed the border alone to appear for in-person interviews, where ICE agents may question or arrest them. Advocates say parents have already been detained, leaving children trapped in shelters for months.Why It Matters: The policy weaponizes family reunification, using children as bait to target undocumented parents. By turning a child welfare process into a cruel immigration dragnet, Trump is deepening fear in immigrant communities and prolonging kids\u2019 confinement.Source: Associated PressAlarm after FBI arrests US army veteran for \u2018conspiracy\u2019 over protest against IceWhat Happened: Afghanistan war veteran Bajun Mavalwalla II was arrested by the FBI and charged with \u201cconspiracy to impede or injure officers\u201d after joining a protest against ICE in Spokane, Washington. Though not accused of assault, he faces up to six years in prison, with legal experts warning that the broad conspiracy charge is being used to suppress dissent.Why It Matters: Prosecuting a decorated veteran for nonviolent protest marks a new level in Trump\u2019s assault on First Amendment rights. By twisting conspiracy laws into tools of repression, his regime is testing how far it can go and sending a warning to Americans that opposing ICE could land them in federal prison.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFormer CDC directors slam RFK Jr. in op-ed: \"Endangering every American's health\"What Happened: Nine former CDC directors from both parties blasted RFK Jr. in a New York Times op-ed, saying his purge of CDC Director Susan Monarez and other moves are \u201cendangering every American\u2019s health.\u201d Top CDC officials have resigned in protest as Kennedy cancels research, reshapes vaccine committees, and aligns the agency with Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: The dismantling of CDC leadership in the middle of outbreaks undermines decades of public health safeguards. By politicizing science and pushing anti-vaccine rhetoric, Kennedy is crippling America\u2019s capacity to defend against deadly diseases.Source: CBS NewsKennedy wants to limit CDC\u2019s role to infectious diseasesWhat Happened: In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, RFK Jr. said the CDC should be limited to infectious diseases, arguing its broader work on chronic illness and other health issues reflects \u201cmission creep\u201d and eroded trust. The piece came a day after nine former CDC directors accused him of endangering public health following the purge of CDC Director Susan Monarez and mass staff resignations.Why It Matters: Kennedy plans to hollow out the CDC, stripping its role in chronic disease, vaccines, and core public health programs. It turns the agency into a political weapon and leaves Americans exposed to deadly health threats far beyond pandemics.Source: NBC NewsMore than 85 climate experts say Energy Department report on greenhouse gases is \"full of errors\"What Happened: More than 85 climate scientists from around the world issued a 439-page rebuttal to the Energy Department report that downplayed the harms of greenhouse gases. They say the DOE document is riddled with errors, cherry-picks data, and was crafted by fossil fuel allies to cast doubt on climate science.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to hijack federal science, replacing evidence with industry propaganda to justify fossil fuel policies. By corrupting climate research, his regime undermines global action and endangers public trust in science itself.Source: CBS NewsHundreds of staff at California national parks to unionize amid Trump turmoilWhat Happened: Nearly 600 employees at Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon voted overwhelmingly to unionize after Trump\u2019s mass purges and budget slashes gutted the National Park Service. With a quarter of staff gone and scientists cleaning bathrooms, workers turned to the National Federation of Federal Employees for protection.Why It Matters: Unionizing is a direct rebuke to Trump\u2019s assault on federal workers and public lands. Park staff are fighting back against cuts and intimidation tactics that have left U.S. parks in crisis.Source: The GuardianRFK Jr critic Paul Offit removed from FDA vaccine advisory committeeWhat Happened: Paul Offit, a leading vaccine expert and vocal critic of RFK Jr., was abruptly removed from the FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee despite being cleared for another term through 2027. His purge follows Kennedy\u2019s purge of the CDC\u2019s immunization panel and comes as the regime rolls back Covid vaccine access.Why It Matters: Kennedy continues to sideline independent experts and stack health agencies with conspiracy theorists, undermining vaccine policy and public trust. By purging scientists like Offit, he\u2019s advancing his anti-vaccine agenda at the expense of America\u2019s health.Source: The GuardianIn windy Iowa, a GOP lawmaker faces a reckoning over Trump\u2019s clean energy warWhat Happened: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who won reelection by just 799 votes, is under fire after backing Trump\u2019s bill that slashed wind energy incentives. The move threatens Iowa\u2019s wind industry, which supplies two-thirds of the state\u2019s power and supports thousands of jobs.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crusade against clean energy is colliding with Republican districts that rely on it economically. In Iowa, where wind farms fund schools, farmers, and local governments, GOP fealty to Trump could cost them at the ballot box.Source: PoliticoA red state community bet on carbon capture. Trump is blocking it.What Happened: Trump canceled a $500 million grant for a carbon capture project at a Heidelberg cement plant in deep-red Indiana, derailing plans to slash emissions and create local jobs. Industry leaders warn that the move hands a competitive edge to China and Europe, which are racing ahead in low-carbon cement.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s war on clean energy is sabotaging U.S. innovation and killing jobs even in Republican strongholds. By gutting carbon capture projects, he\u2019s ceding global leadership to rivals and putting America\u2019s industrial future at risk.Source: Washington PostUS SEC to offer more buyouts to supervisors, memo saysWhat Happened: The SEC is rolling out new buyout incentives to push supervisors to retire, resign, or accept demotions, according to internal memos. Earlier buyouts this year already triggered hundreds of staff departures, accelerating a reshaping of the agency under Trump.Why It Matters: Forcing out veteran supervisors hollows out the SEC\u2019s expertise and weakens its ability to police Wall Street. The exodus will turn the SEC into a shell, leaving investors and the financial system vulnerable.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump confirms U.S. strike on alleged Venezuelan drug boatWhat Happened: Trump announced that a U.S. Navy destroyer struck a vessel in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 people he called \u201cterrorists\u201d tied to Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua gang. The strike comes after U.S. warships were deployed off Venezuela and amid U.S. accusations that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads a drug cartel.Why It Matters: The operation escalates tensions and looks more like regime change than a counternarcotics operation. By militarizing the standoff, Trump risks destabilizing the region.Source: NPRRussia, China Close In on Pipeline Deal, Leaving Beijing With the Upper HandWhat Happened: Russia and China signed a memorandum to advance the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which would send gas to China for 30 years. But Beijing left core issues\u2014pricing, financing, and construction\u2014unsettled, highlighting China\u2019s leverage as Moscow looks to replace lost European markets.Why It Matters: Sanctions have forced Russia into dependence on China, tilting the relationship sharply in Beijing\u2019s favor. By trading away energy at a discount, Putin is ceding leverage and leaving Russia at Xi\u2019s mercy.Source: Wall Street JournalLeaders of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran gather in Beijing for huge military parade in challenge to the WestWhat Happened: Xi Jinping staged a massive Beijing military parade with Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and Iran\u2019s president at his side \u2014 the first time the four leaders of the axis of evil appeared together. The event showcased advanced weapons and defiance of the West. Just a day earlier, Xi welcomed India\u2019s Prime Minister Modi, signaling his bid to pull U.S. partners closer.Why It Matters: The display highlights a tightening authoritarian bloc led by China. With Russia dependent on Beijing, and North Korea and Iran arming Moscow, Xi is positioning himself as the broker of a new world order.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPoland launches its largest military drills as Russia, Belarus set to hold exercisesWhat Happened: Poland began Iron Defender-25, its biggest exercise of the year, mobilizing 30,000 troops and 600 pieces of equipment across land, sea, air, and cyber domains. The drills coincide with Russian-led operations in Belarus and the upcoming Zapad-2025 exercises.Why It Matters: Warsaw sits on NATO\u2019s front line, bordering both Belarus and Kaliningrad. By integrating lessons from Russia\u2019s genocidal war in Ukraine, Poland is reiterating its readiness and reinforcing NATO\u2019s deterrence posture against Russia\u2019s growing military aggression.Source: Kyiv IndependentNATO Says It\u2019s Working to Counter Russian GPS Jamming After Interference With European Commission President\u2019s PlaneWhat Happened: NATO chief Mark Rutte confirmed the alliance is working \u201cday and night\u201d to counter Russian GPS jamming after interference disrupted a plane carrying European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Bulgaria. Pilots had to rely on paper maps to land safely, with EU officials calling it a \u201cblatant\u201d act of Russian aggression.Why It Matters: Russia targeting a top EU leader\u2019s plane is a direct threat to Europe\u2019s leadership. It marks a dangerous escalation, and NATO must respond because inaction only emboldens the Kremlin.Source: TIMEUkrainian police say Russia linked to murder of former parliament speakerWhat Happened: Former Ukrainian parliamentary speaker Andriy Parubiy, a leader of the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution, was assassinated in central Kyiv by a gunman disguised as a delivery worker. Police arrested a suspect and said there is a \u201cRussian trace\u201d in the killing, the latest in a string of assassinations of pro-Western Ukrainian figures.Source: Politico\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsCook\u2019s Lawyers Fire Back at Trump\u2019s Claim of Vast Powers to Oust Fed OfficialsWhat Happened: Lisa Cook\u2019s lawyers asked a federal judge to swiftly reinstate her after Trump attempted to fire her from the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, arguing the president lacks sweeping authority to oust central bank officials at will. Why It Matters: This is a test of the Fed\u2019s independence. If Trump can fire governors at will, he turns monetary policy into a political weapon\u2014eroding global trust in the institution that underpins the U.S. economy.Source: New York TimesUS regulators cancel bank exams as Trump rollback gathers paceWhat Happened: Trump regulators at the OCC, Fed, and CFPB are canceling or scaling back bank exams, dropping scrutiny of climate, diversity, and consumer risks. Formal disciplinary notices are being replaced with softer, informal guidance, despite warnings that weak oversight contributed to past bank collapses.Why It Matters: This rollback strips away safeguards against another financial crisis. By gutting supervision, Trump is giving Wall Street freer rein\u2014prioritizing profits over stability and leaving the public exposed to systemic risk.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Blue states that sued kept most CDC grants, while red states feel brunt of Trump clawbacksWhat Happened: Trump canceled nearly 700 CDC grants worth $11 billion, cutting public health programs nationwide. Blue states that sued in court won most of their funding back, while red states like Texas, Georgia, and Oklahoma lost nearly all their grants, forcing layoffs and halting vaccine clinics amid measles and flu outbreaks.Source: NBC NewsD.C. grand jury declines to indict another defendant amid Trump's crime crackdownWhat Happened: A D.C. grand jury refused to indict a woman accused of threatening Trump online, marking at least the sixth time in recent weeks that jurors have declined charges tied to his federal policing surge. Locals have also rejected indictments against residents accused of minor confrontations with federal agents.Source: NBC NewsUS appeals court reinstates FTC commissioner fired by TrumpWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled that Trump unlawfully fired FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, reinstating her in a 2-1 decision. Judges said the law has long barred presidents from removing commissioners without cause, rejecting Trump\u2019s bid to override those protections.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers9/6 \u2014 Next Day of Action931,129 \u2014 Political spending at Trump properties since his second inauguration.5 billion \u2014 Paper wealth boost for the Trump family from their new crypto token, WLFI.2 million \u2014 Contract Trump revived for ICE to buy Israeli spyware from Paragon Solutions.600 \u2014 Yosemite and Sequoia & Kings Canyon staff who voted to unionize after Trump\u2019s park service cuts.9 \u2014 Former CDC directors warning that RFK Jr.\u2019s purge is \u201cendangering every American\u2019s health.\u201d500 million \u2014 Carbon capture grant Trump canceled at a Heidelberg cement plant in Indiana.30,000 \u2014 Troops mobilized by Poland for its Iron Defender-25 military drills.700 \u2014 CDC grants canceled by Trump, worth nearly $11 billion in public health funding.600 \u2014 Pentagon lawyers authorized to serve as temporary immigration judges.1,000 \u2014 Bonuses offered to local police for hitting ICE arrest targets.85+ \u2014 Climate experts who blasted DOE\u2019s greenhouse gas report as \u201cfull of errors.\u201d\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump\u2019s ICE is disappearing American citizens \u2014 How far will the regime be allowed to go in bypassing due process and constitutional protections?Chicago is next on Trump\u2019s list for military occupation \u2014 Will courts block him again, or will troops roll in?Russia and China are tightening their energy pact \u2014 How much leverage will Beijing extract as Moscow grows more desperate?RFK Jr. is dismantling the CDC\u2019s authority \u2014 How long before a major outbreak exposes the cost of his anti-vaccine agenda?Trump\u2019s Pentagon is embedding lawyers as immigration judges \u2014 Will due process survive the militarization of U.S. courts?GOP lawmakers are tied to Trump\u2019s energy rollback \u2014 Will wind states like Iowa revolt at the ballot box?Federal regulators are being hollowed out \u2014 At what point does Wall Street\u2019s free rein trigger the next financial crisis?Paragon spyware is in ICE\u2019s hands \u2014 How soon until this dictatorship tool is turned on all Americans, not just immigrants?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Authoritarian Tactics \u2014 From militarizing cities to bounty-hunting migrants, Trump is erasing legal limits on presidential power while testing how much repression Americans will tolerate.Science Under Siege \u2014 RFK Jr.\u2019s purge of health experts and Kennedy-Trump propaganda on vaccines and climate show how federal science is being weaponized for ideology while putting Americans at risk.Axis of Evil \u2014 Beijing\u2019s military parade with Putin, Kim, and Iran underscores a new authoritarian bloc, just as NATO scrambles to respond to Russia\u2019s escalations against Europe.Surveillance State Expansion \u2014 ICE\u2019s new spyware powers mark the next phase of Trump\u2019s authoritarian project: immigrants are the test case, but mass surveillance of journalists, activists, and ordinary Americans is coming.Institutional Capture \u2014 From purging Fed governors to hollowing out regulators like the SEC and FTC, Trump is dismantling independent checks and turning once-neutral institutions into partisan tools.Grassroots Pushback \u2014 Unionization at national parks, grand jury refusals in D.C., and blue states clawing back federal funds show cracks in Trump\u2019s grip and organized resistance\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

directly under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arrested in Las Vegas for soliciting a child for sex. The Trump Administration is complicit in 1) whisking the official out of  the country and 2) arranging for his state-based attorney. Netanyahu denied he was arrested, except the arrest warrant says otherwise. A Trump-picked advisor defends the Israeli official.</span></p><p><span><a class=\"linkified\" href=\"https://hotbuttons.substack.com/p/trump-picked-advisor-defends-israeli\" rel=\"nofollow ugc
