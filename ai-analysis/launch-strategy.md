# Launch Strategy for The Kleptocracy Timeline

## Core Message

This project documents the systematic capture of democratic institutions through 882+ verified events from 1970-2025. The data shows an exponential acceleration: from ~1 major capture event per year in the 1970s to 632 events in 2025 alone. This isn't drift—it's a cascade, with a doubling time of 3.7 years.

## The Memorial Context

This project is dedicated to the journalists and researchers who have paid the ultimate price exposing these networks. Their sacrifice is why this must be:
- **Open**: Anyone can verify and contribute
- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Resilient**: The work continues regardless of pressure

See IN_MEMORIAM.md for those we honor.

## Key Statistics

- **882 documented events** (1970-2025)
- **746 events in the 2020s** 
- **632 events in 2025 alone** (through September)
- **Doubling time: 3.7 years** (exponential growth)
- **Top actors**: Donald Trump (480), Trump Administration (350), DOJ (38)
- **557 well-sourced events** with multiple independent sources

## The Cascade Pattern

The timeline reveals a clear pattern:
1. Capture regulator → Remove oversight
2. Capture courts → Remove recourse  
3. Capture enforcement → Make law selective
4. Capture media → Hide the pattern

This is exactly what exponential cascades look like in complex systems.

## Launch Components
