# Editorial Action Plan

## Prioritized To-Do List

### 1. Bulk Add Sources (IMMEDIATE)
**Target:** 41 single-source entries

**Top 7 High-Impact Events:**
1. **Qatar $400M jet** - 5 sources ready
2. **ICE 100-day milestone** - 3 sources ready  
3. **DOJ/FBI corruption units** - 2 sources ready
4. **Paramount settlement** - 2 sources ready
5. **Vietnam resort** - 4 sources ready
6. **Operation At Large** - 4 sources ready (flag as partial)
7. **Megadonor access** - needs primary source

---

### 2. Flag Future-Dated Items
**Action:** Mark 2025 events after Sept 2 as "announced/planned"
- Add follow-up check dates
- Set status to `developing` until confirmed

---

### 3. Standardize "Official vs. Independent" Format

**Template:**
```yaml
summary: |
  Official claim: [Agency/source] reports X
  Independent analysis: [Outlet] identifies discrepancies Y
  Assessment: On balance, evidence suggests Z
  
sources:
  - title: [Official release]
    outlet: [Government agency]
    type: official
    
  - title: [Independent analysis]
    outlet: [News organization]
    type: independent
```

**Priority Events:**
- Immigration enforcement numbers
- DOGE impact claims
- Media policy changes

---

### 4. Link Structural Levers to Outputs

**Required Connections:**
- DOGE memos → specific program cuts/pauses
- Jarkesy decision → venue shift statistics
- Platform policy changes → content moderation data
- Foreign gifts → policy concessions timeline

---

### 5. Add Money Trail Details

**Focus Areas:**
- **Qatar jet**: Retrofit costs, appropriation lines
- **Vietnam resort**: Investment structure, beneficiaries
- **Crypto tokens**: Fee structures, treasury flows
- **Campaign finance**: Donor → access correlations

---

### 6. Create Broker Case File Pages

**Seven Core Brokers:**
1. DOGE (structural control)
2. DOJ/SEC (enforcement leverage)
3. ICE/DHS (coercive apparatus)
4. Foreign finance (Qatar, Vietnam)
5. Media leverage (Paramount, platforms)
6. Supreme Court (gifts ecosystem)
7. Crypto ventures (WLFI, $TRUMP)

**Each Page Includes:**
- Executive summary
- Evidence compilation
- Network connections
- Metrics to track
- Visualization priorities

---

### 7. Watch List - Fresh Coverage to Monitor

**Immediate Cascade Edges:**
1. **WLFI token live** - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-world-liberty-financial-tokens-begin-trading-2025-09-01/)
2. **Chicago ICE operations** - [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/27/trump-chicago-ice-military/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chicago-thousands-protest-against-threat-ice-national-guard-deployment-2025-09-01/)
3. **Qatar jet acceptance** - Multiple sources tracking
4. **Paramount settlement** - [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-board-settle-trumps-60-232007630.html)
