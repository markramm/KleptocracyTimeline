## Launch Copy Update

**Current draft states:** "790 documented events... 100+ per year in the 2020s; 2025 on track for 200+"

**Accurate headline:** 
- 882 documented events
- 746 in the 2020s
- 2025 already at 632 entries (caveat about future-dated/planned items)

## Narrative Copy for Announcement

> **The Capture Cascade keeps accelerating.** The dataset now contains **882 documented events** (1970–2025). In the 1970s, we found **~1 major capture per year**; in the 2010s, **~9/year**. In the 2020s, the pace explodes: **746 events so far**, with **2025 alone at 632 entries** (some future-dated announcements). A log-fit on yearly counts since 2010 implies a **doubling about every 3.7 years**. That pattern—*capture a regulator → remove oversight; capture courts → remove recourse; capture enforcement → make law selective; capture media → hide the pattern*—is exactly what exponential cascades look like in complex systems.

## Key Patterns Identified

1. **Regulatory capture** dominates the tag landscape
2. **Massive acceleration** in 2025 (632 events in 8 months)
3. **Actor concentration** around Trump ecosystem (830+ events)
4. **Source weakness** in 41 high-impact events needs immediate attention

## Next Actions

1. Shore up single-source events (41 items)
2. Update launch copy with accurate numbers
3. Flag future-dated events appropriately
4. Standardize "official vs. independent" sourcing format
5. Create dedicated broker case files
