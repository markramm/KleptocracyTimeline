## KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Legislative Lock-In
OBBBA Title IX explicitly funds AI/ML surveillance and defines "autonomous" towers, baking algorithmic enforcement into statutory appropriations.

### 2. Procurement Path-Dependence
Sole-source notices and serial modifications demonstrate vendor lock-in via proprietary platforms rather than open recompetitions.

### 3. Oversight Asymmetry
BIS/EO 14093 and foreign regulators act as brakes, yet U.S. operational agencies continue or expand contracts.

### 4. Ethics Theater vs Power
Axon ethics board revolt shows limits of corporate self-regulation where public contracts are at stake.
