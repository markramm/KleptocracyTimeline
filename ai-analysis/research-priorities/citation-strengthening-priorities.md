## Quick Wins for Event Text Quality

1. **Always present "official vs. independent"** where numbers diverge
2. **Anchor structural claims** in primary law/instrument (link to EOs, not just press)
3. **For allegation-heavy items**, mark "needs primary" and add strongest investigative piece
4. **For foreign influence**, show both deal facts and U.S. constitutional issue
5. **Link structural levers to outputs** (DOGE memos → concrete cuts; Jarkesy → venue shifts)
6. **Add money trail detail** in foreign gift entries (who pays, which appropriations moved)

## Standardized Presentation Format
