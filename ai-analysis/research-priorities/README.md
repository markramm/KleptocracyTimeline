# Research Priorities for Timeline Event Verification

*Last Updated: December 2, 2025*

This directory contains prioritized research tasks for timeline events that need:
- Source verification and balance (official vs. independent reporting)
- Clarity improvements and de-duplication
- Replacement of placeholder sources
- Additional corroboration for single-source claims

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1 Complete (September 2025)
- Fixed all 86 high-priority events (importance 8-10)
- Added 294 verified sources
- Removed all placeholder sources from critical events

### âœ… Phase 2 Progress (December 2025)
- Fixed 5 P0 critical issues
- Added 16 additional sources
- Total events fixed: 90
- Total sources added: 310

## Priority Levels

- **ðŸ”´ P0 - Highest Priority**: Placeholders, questionable or single-source claims, materially incomplete events
  - **Status**: 5/12 completed (7 others already fixed or non-existent)
- **ðŸŸ  P1 - Medium Priority**: Cleanups, balance improvements, richer context needed
  - **Status**: Ready to begin
- **ðŸŸ¡ P2 - Lower Priority**: Polish for accuracy and completeness
  - **Status**: Not yet started

## Structure

- `P0-highest-priority.md` - Critical items needing immediate attention
- `P1-medium-priority.md` - Important cleanups and balance improvements  
- `P2-lower-priority.md` - Polish and completeness improvements
- `cross-cutting-cleanups.md` - Systematic improvements across multiple events

## Workflow

1. Review priority lists starting with P0
2. For each item, verify the event exists in the timeline
3. Research and add sources following the specified mix of official and independent reporting
4. Update event status (confirmed/reported/disputed) based on findings
5. Archive all external links using Wayback Machine
6. Track completion in each priority document

## Next Priorities

### Remaining P0 Items (7 items)
1. Reyes Holdings / Section 232 tariff exclusions (2018)
2. Sinclair "40% of households" claim (2022) 
3. Sinclair "must-run" script (2018)
4. Air Force crews at Trump Turnberry (2019)
5. Meta/Cambridge Analytica regulatory outcomes (2018)
6. Musk-Putin "regular contact" allegation (2024)
7. WLFI/USD1/Binance SEC dismissal timing (2025)

### P1 Items Ready to Start (showing first 5)
1. Musk "digital coup" - needs mainstream synthesis
2. DOGE injunction court details
3. Troy Meink SpaceX-NRO contract allegations
4. Meta board adds Dina Powell McCormick
5. White House visitor logs non-release

## Key Principles

- Always include both official positions and independent/investigative reporting for controversial items
- Replace categorical language with precise, attributed statements
- Include court names, case numbers, and official document references where available
- Ensure dates and jurisdictions are accurate and complete
