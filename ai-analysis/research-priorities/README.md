# Research Priorities for Timeline Event Verification

This directory contains prioritized research tasks for timeline events that need:
- Source verification and balance (official vs. independent reporting)
- Clarity improvements and de-duplication
- Replacement of placeholder sources
- Additional corroboration for single-source claims

## Priority Levels

- **ðŸ”´ P0 - Highest Priority**: Placeholders, questionable or single-source claims, materially incomplete events
- **ðŸŸ  P1 - Medium Priority**: Cleanups, balance improvements, richer context needed
- **ðŸŸ¡ P2 - Lower Priority**: Polish for accuracy and completeness

## Structure

- `P0-highest-priority.md` - Critical items needing immediate attention
- `P1-medium-priority.md` - Important cleanups and balance improvements  
- `P2-lower-priority.md` - Polish and completeness improvements
- `cross-cutting-cleanups.md` - Systematic improvements across multiple events

## Workflow

1. Review priority lists starting with P0
2. For each item, verify the event exists in the timeline
3. Research and add sources following the specified mix of official and independent reporting
4. Update event status (confirmed/reported/disputed) based on findings
5. Archive all external links using Wayback Machine
6. Track completion in each priority document

## Key Principles

- Always include both official positions and independent/investigative reporting for controversial items
- Replace categorical language with precise, attributed statements
- Include court names, case numbers, and official document references where available
- Ensure dates and jurisdictions are accurate and complete
