# Local News Capture and Alternative Conservative Media Networks
*Generated: 2025-08-23*

## Executive Summary

Over the past 30 years, a systematic capture of local news has occurred alongside the creation of alternative conservative media networks. This investigation reveals how billionaire-funded operations have consolidated local TV stations, enforced synchronized messaging, and built parallel media infrastructures that now reach the majority of American households with coordinated conservative content while appearing as independent local news.

## Timeline of Media Capture

### Phase 1: Fox News Foundation (1970s-1996)
- **1970**: Roger Ailes creates plan for Nixon's "pro-administration" network
- **1996**: Fox News launches with Murdoch funding and Ailes leadership
- **Strategy**: Create "counterweight" to perceived liberal media bias
- **Impact**: Established template for partisan news as "fair and balanced"

### Phase 2: Local Station Consolidation (2000s-2010s)
- **Sinclair Broadcast Group**: Grows to own 193 stations reaching 40% of households
- **Nexstar Media Group**: Becomes largest owner with 197 stations, 63% reach
- **Gray Television**: Aggressive acquisition strategy across markets
- **Method**: Buy local affiliates, maintain local branding, control content centrally

### Phase 3: Alternative Networks (2013-Present)
- **2013**: OANN created at AT&T's request for "conservative network"
- **2014**: Newsmax TV launches on DirecTV/Dish
- **2020**: Post-election boom for alternative networks
- **2022**: OANN loses AT&T support, near collapse

## Major Players and Their Reach

### One America News Network (OANN)
**Creation Story**:

## Capture Mechanisms

### 1. Regulatory Manipulation

- **Advertising Leverage**: Threatening boycotts
- **Bundling Deals**: Cable package requirements

### 3. Content Control Systems

- **Viewer Deception**: Unaware of ownership

## Impact on Democracy

### Information Environment
- **40-63%** of households receive controlled messaging
- **Local Trust Exploited**: People trust local news most
- **Synchronized Propaganda**: Identical messages nationwide
- **Alternative Facts**: Parallel reality creation

### Political Effects
- **2020 Election**: Lies amplified across networks
- **January 6**: Radicalization through local stations

- **Candidate Support**: Mandatory pro-Trump coverage

### Economic Consequences
- **Local Journalism Death**: Independent outlets crushed
- **Job Losses**: Centralized production eliminates positions
- **Community Disconnect**: Less local investigation
- **Advertising Monopoly**: Control local ad markets

## The AT&T/OANN Revelation

Most shocking discovery: AT&T didn't just carry OANN - they **created** it:
- Told Herring they wanted conservative network
- Provided 90% of revenue
- Without AT&T, value was "zero"
- Dropped after January 6 backlash

This proves major corporations actively create propaganda networks, not just distribute them.

## Newsmax's Knowing Deception

Internal communications prove deliberate lying:
- Ruddy: "We have no evidence" (Nov 12, 2020)
- Aired false claims 23 more times
- Called Sidney Powell crazy privately
- Promoted her theories publicly
- **Result**: $107 million in settlements

## Current State (2025)

### Consolidation Complete
- **Nexstar**: 197 stations, largest owner
- **Sinclair**: 193 stations, most partisan
- **Gray/Tegna**: Regional dominance
- **Independent**: Nearly extinct

### Alternative Networks Status
- **Fox News**: Dominant, profitable
- **Newsmax**: Public company, billionaire owner
- **OANN**: Near death after AT&T exit
- **NewsNation**: "Fox lite" positioning

### Regulatory Capture
- **FCC**: Enables further consolidation
- **Congress**: No meaningful oversight
- **Courts**: Defer to corporate interests
- **States**: Powerless against federal rules

## Conclusion

The capture of local news represents one of the most successful and damaging propaganda operations in American history. By hiding partisan messaging behind trusted local brands, conservative billionaires and corporations have created a parallel information ecosystem that appears legitimate while serving political ends.

The Sinclair model of forced messaging through "must-run" segments, combined with Nexstar's scale and Fox News's template, means the majority of Americans receive coordinated conservative propaganda disguised as local news. The revelation that AT&T literally created OANN to have another conservative voice shows corporate America's active role in building these propaganda networks.

Most disturbing is how this capture exploits Americans' trust in local news - the most trusted form of media - to spread synchronized political messages while maintaining the facade of independent, community-focused journalism. With consolidation nearly complete and regulatory capture ensuring no intervention, the local news landscape has been transformed into a coordinated propaganda distribution system reaching into nearly every American home.
