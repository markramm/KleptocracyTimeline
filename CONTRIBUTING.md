# Contributing to Kleptocracy Timeline

Thank you for helping document threats to democracy! This guide will help you contribute effectively.

## üéØ What We're Looking For

### Events That Belong Here

‚úÖ **Include events that:**
- Demonstrate institutional capture or corruption
- Show patterns of democratic erosion
- Involve abuse of power for private gain
- Reveal systemic rather than isolated problems
- Can be verified through multiple sources
- Have specific dates and concrete outcomes

‚ùå **Exclude events that:**
- Are purely partisan disagreements
- Lack credible sources
- Are speculation or predictions (unless marked as such)
- Focus on personal scandals without systemic impact
- Cannot be independently verified

## üìù Adding New Events

### Step 1: Check for Duplicates

Search existing events first:
```bash
grep -r "your search term" timeline_data/events/
```

### Step 2: Create Your Event File

Create a new file in `timeline_data/events/` named:
```
YYYY-MM-DD--brief-description.json
```

### Step 3: Use This Template

```json
{
  "id": "YYYY-MM-DD--brief-description",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "title": "Factual, neutral title without editorializing",
  "summary": "Objective description of what happened. Include: What specifically occurred, which institutions/people were involved, what the immediate impact was, and why this represents a systemic issue. Keep it factual. No speculation or editorial language.",
  "status": "pending",
  "location": "City, State",
  "actors": [
    "Person Name (Role)",
    "Organization Name"
  ],
  "tags": [
    "democratic-erosion",
    "regulatory-capture"
  ],
  "sources": [

      "url": "https://original-source.com/article",
      "outlet": "Publication Name",
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "archived_url": "https://web.archive.org/..."
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Additional context for researchers (optional) - won't be displayed publicly"
```

### Step 4: Validate Your Event

Before submitting, run:
```bash
python3 tools/validation/validate_timeline_dates.py
```

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch: `add-event-YYYY-MM-DD-description`
3. Add your event file
4. Commit with message: `Add: YYYY-MM-DD event description`
5. Open a Pull Request
