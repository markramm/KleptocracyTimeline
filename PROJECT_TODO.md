## üìù Notes

### Known Issues
1. Many archive URLs point to homepages not articles
2. Source dates often use event date not publication date
3. Some summaries too brief
4. Viewer app needs path updates
5. Tests need to be updated for new structure

### Questions to Resolve
1. Should we require 2+ sources for "confirmed" status?
2. How to handle disputed/controversial events?
3. Should we add a "reliability score" to sources?
4. How to handle events with no available sources?
5. Should we version the timeline data?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All events have verified sources
- [ ] No broken links in repository
- [ ] Tests achieve >90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Community can easily contribute
- [ ] Timeline is searchable and filterable
- [ ] Data can be exported and reused
