# Research CLI Wrapper
#
# Simplified wrapper for research_cli.py that handles Python path setup automatically.
# This makes the CLI easier to use without having to remember PYTHONPATH settings.
#
# Usage:
#   ./research <command> [options]
#
# Examples:
#   ./research get-stats
#   ./research search-events --query "Trump crypto"
#   ./research server-status
#   ./research help
#

# Get the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Set up Python path for imports
export PYTHONPATH="${SCRIPT_DIR}/client:${SCRIPT_DIR}/server:${PYTHONPATH}"

# Run the CLI with all arguments passed through
exec python3 "${SCRIPT_DIR}/cli/research_cli.py" "$@"
