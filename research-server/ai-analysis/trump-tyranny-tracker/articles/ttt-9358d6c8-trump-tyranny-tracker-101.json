Tyrone Turner/WAMU/NPShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 30Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Company Strikes Qatari Golf Resort Deal in Sign It\u2019s Not Holding Back from Foreign BusinessWhat Happened: The Trump Organization has signed a new deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar in partnership with Saudi and Qatari firms, despite Trump\u2019s ongoing presidency.Why It Matters: Trump is cashing in on foreign policy, ignoring conflict-of-interest rules while cutting deals that benefit Saudi royals and his businesses\u2014more blatant pay-to-play corruption at the highest level.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s Maximalist Assertion of Presidential Power Tests the Rule of LawWhat Happened: In just 100 days, Trump has bulldozed legal norms to seize unprecedented executive power\u2014gutting checks and balances, bypassing Congress, defying courts, and pushing the far-right unitary executive theory. Trump has taken control over the Justice Department, centralized legal power inside the White House, and weaponized emergency powers to rule by fiat.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t governance\u2014it\u2019s a full-blown authoritarian power grab. Trump is tearing down the very checks and balances that define American democracy, rewriting the Constitution to place himself above the law, and using executive power like a dictator, consolidating control.Source: New York TimesTrump claims he 'could' have Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the U.S.What Happened: Trump told ABC News he could bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador \u201cwith one call,\u201d directly contradicting his officials\u2019 repeated claims in court that the U.S. has no power to do so. Despite court orders at every level to return Garcia, the DOJ has insisted El Salvador alone controls his custody.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s admission torpedoes his legal argument and confirms the U.S. maintains de facto control over deportees held in El Salvador\u2014reiterating his use of unchecked executive power, open defiance of the Supreme Court, and systematic abuse fueling his mass deportation agenda.Source: NBC NewsThere is no news article for this yet.Source: X\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsF.B.I. Reassigns Agents Who Knelt During 2020 Racial Justice ProtestsWhat Happened: The F.B.I. has reassigned several female supervisory agents who knelt during the 2020 racial justice protests in Washington, D.C.\u2014a clear act of political retaliation by Kash Patel. Their actions had already been deemed lawful and compliant with F.B.I. policy.Why It Matters: This is political retribution. Trump\u2019s FBI is punishing agents for peaceful acts of conscience to appease his base\u2014transforming federal law enforcement into a tool of fear, loyalty enforcement, and MAGA ideological purity.Source: New York TimesDOGE Put a College Student in Charge of Using AI to Rewrite RegulationsWhat Happened: A 21-year-old unvetted Musk operative, Christopher Sweet, has been appointed to use AI to rewrite federal housing regulations at HUD\u2014despite having no government experience. Sweet is reportedly leading a sweeping deregulation effort across agencies, including rules governing public and tribal housing.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk\u2019s regime is handing critical rulemaking power to a college student and an AI model, gathering data, and bypassing legal safeguards and oversight to gut protections for vulnerable communities and fast-track control over federal policy.Source: WIREDTrump Officials Increasingly Recruit Local Police for Immigration Enforcement Despite \u2018Red Flags\u2019What Happened: Trump has signed over 370 new agreements, tripling the number of local law enforcement agencies deputized to enforce federal immigration laws\u2014despite known civil rights violations, abuse scandals, and past rejections. Among them is North Carolina\u2019s Columbus County sheriff\u2019s office, previously denied for its troubling record but now enlisted in Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda.Why It Matters: Trump is unleashing a nationwide dragnet with no oversight, reviving the most abusive enforcement tactics, and empowering racist, corrupt local departments to target immigrants. They are building the infrastructure to suppress dissent and control everyone.Source: The GuardianChris Krebs Kicked Off CBP\u2019s Global Entry ProgramWhat Happened: Former CISA director Chris Krebs, who affirmed the security of the 2020 election, was abruptly removed from the Global Entry program. The move comes weeks after Trump stripped him of any remaining security clearances and ordered a DOJ investigation, despite no evidence of wrongdoing.Why It Matters: More of Trump\u2019s retribution. Trump is using federal powers to go after public servants like Chris Krebs\u2014people who simply did their jobs. The message is clear\u2014 tell the truth, and the government will be weaponized against you.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsLovefest or Cabinet Meeting? For Donald Trump, It\u2019s BothWhat Happened: In a two-hour Cabinet meeting marking Trump\u2019s first 100 days back in office, top officials\u2014including JD Vance and Marco Rubio\u2014showered Trump with over-the-top praise, crediting him with \u201csaving 258 million lives\u201d and flaunting \u201cGulf of America\u201d hats. The spectacle compares to the cult-like loyalty displays seen in Russia.Why It Matters: The sycophantic Cabinet spectacle exemplifies the authoritarian-style loyalty defining Trump\u2019s second term\u2014where truth, accountability, and policy take a back seat to blind flattery. Source: Associated PressEducation Department Opens Probe Into Chicago Public SchoolsWhat Happened:  The Education Department has launched a Title VI investigation into Chicago Public Schools over its \u201cBlack Students Success Plan,\u201d alleging the initiative illegally prioritized resources based on race. The probe follows a complaint from the conservative group Defending Education.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on civil rights. Trump is targeting race- and gender-based support programs in schools, slashing civil rights enforcement, and reversing decades of protections for marginalized students\u2014while weaponizing federal agencies to enforce an extremist white nationalist agenda.Source: The HillNew York Times Fires Back After Trump ThreatWhat Happened: The New York Times issued a defiant statement defending press freedom after Trump threatened legal action over its reporting on his lawsuit against Paramount Global. Trump accused the Times of \"tortious interference\" in elections following an article detailing settlement talks related to a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.Why It Matters: Trump is using legal threats to bully journalists into silence. It\u2019s a classic authoritarian move\u2014punish the press, discredit the truth, and control the narrative.Source: The HillTrump Pressures Journalist to Accept Doctored Photo as Real: \u2018Why Don\u2019t You Just Say Yes?\u2019What Happened: In a combative interview, Trump berated ABC\u2019s Terry Moran, pressuring him to validate a clearly doctored photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia with a gang tattoo. When Moran refused, Trump snapped: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say yes,\u201d accusing him of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d Trump also downplayed migrants\u2019 due process rights.Why It Matters: The interview laid bare Trump\u2019s contempt for facts, the rule of law, and press freedom, showing an authoritarian leader who bullies the press, rewrites reality, and treats truth as an obstacle to power.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsMemorial Wall to Fallen USAID Staffers Removed from Agency\u2019s Former BuildingWhat Happened: Trump removed a memorial wall honoring 99 USAID staffers killed in the line of duty, as part of the rapid dismantling of the agency led by Musk. The fate of the wall remains unclear, though some officials say it may be relocated to the State Department.Why It Matters: This erasure of a solemn tribute to public servants reflects the broader purge of U.S. institutions, where honoring sacrifice is replaced with indifference, and dismantling humanitarian efforts is celebrated as \u201cefficiency.\u201dSource: Associated PressTrump Cuts $1 Billion in School Mental Health Grants, Citing Conflict of PrioritiesWhat Happened: Trump is canceling $1 billion in mental health grants for schools\u2014funding originally passed under President Biden to help hire counselors and psychologists\u2014claiming the programs violated civil rights law and advanced \u201cleft-wing racialism.\u201d The Education Department confirmed the move and said it would \u201cre-envision\u201d the funds.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting school mental health support under the guise of \"diversity\"\u2014leaving all our children in dangerSource: Associated Press\u2018He\u2019s Just a Kid\u2019: Maryland Teen Swept Into Trump Immigration DragnetWhat Happened: Javier Salazar, a 19-year-old Venezuelan immigrant with no criminal record, was nearly disappeared to El Salvador and imprisoned under Trump\u2019s \u201cwartime deportation authority.\u201d ICE agents arrested him in Maryland, labeled him a gang member based on a photo showing what appears to be a toy water gun, and attempted to deport him without a hearing\u2014until the Supreme Court issued a last-minute order halting the removal.Why It Matters: This is another case that exposes the cruelty and lawlessness of Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda\u2014where toy guns become gang evidence, and due process is discarded.Source: The GuardianImmigrants Who Came to the Texas Panhandle to Work Legally Have Been Told They Must LeaveWhat Happened: Trump is revoking legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many from Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela, who entered the U.S. legally under now-terminated humanitarian programs. Individuals received DHS emails ordering them to leave.Why It Matters: This mass revocation will uproot families, gut essential industries, and turn legally settled workers into targets for disappearance\u2014another step in Trump\u2019s campaign to erase humanitarian protections.Source: Associated Press'Not Just El Salvador': Marco Rubio Says U.S. Looking for More Countries to Send MigrantsWhat Happened: Marco Rubio confirmed the U.S. is negotiating with up to 30 countries to accept migrants, particularly those Trump officials label \u201cdespicable\u201d\u2014including individuals being sent to nations they aren\u2019t even from. He stated the goal is to send them \u201cas far away as possible\u201d to prevent their return.Why It Matters: This is exile disguised as deportation. Trump and Rubio are building an international system to disappear migrants\u2014targeting people for permanent removal without regard to human rights, due process, or national origin, and will expand to U.S. citizens.Source: USA TODAYTrump Weighs Deporting Migrants to Libya and RwandaWhat Happened: Trump is in talks with Libya and Rwanda to disappear migrants with criminal records and possibly asylum seekers to Libya and Rwanda, despite serious human rights abuses. Why It Matters: Libya is infamous for torture, rape, and slavery of migrants\u2014yet Trump wants to dump people there with no way back. This isn\u2019t immigration policy, it\u2019s state-sponsored disappearance. By calling migrants \u201cdespicable,\u201d Trump and Rubio continue normalizing dehumanization as official doctrine\u2014and laying the groundwork to expand these tactics against anyone they label \u201cdespicable.\u201dSource: CNN\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchRFK Jr.\u2019s HHS Orders Lab Studying Deadly Infectious Diseases to Stop ResearchWhat Happened: Trump has shut down all research at NIAID\u2019s Integrated Research Facility, a top U.S. lab studying Ebola, Lassa fever, and other lethal pathogens. The order, issued by RFK Jr., has halted critical work at the Fort Detrick-based biosafety-level-4 lab and placed the facility's director on administrative leave.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous blow to national biosecurity that will endanger us all. Trump and RFK Jr. are dismantling America\u2019s capacity to study lethal pathogens like Ebola\u2014gutting pandemic preparedness and crippling global health defenses to serve political vendettas and anti-science extremism.Source: WIREDRFK Jr. Will Require Shift in How New Vaccines Are Tested, HHS SaysWhat Happened: RFK Jr. plans to mandate placebo-controlled trials for all new vaccines before approval\u2014a dramatic policy shift that departs from long-standing immunization practices and has sparked alarm among public health experts.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous move. RFK Jr.\u2019s policy will delay life-saving vaccines, confuse the public, and reinforce anti-vaccine propaganda\u2014all while a measles outbreak spreads and trust in public health already teeters.Source: The Washington PostThe U.S. Has Nearly 900 Measles Cases, and 10 States Have Active OutbreaksWhat Happened: Measles cases in the U.S. have surged to 884, with Texas accounting for the majority in a 3-month-long outbreak. At least three people have died, including two unvaccinated children in West Texas and one adult in New Mexico. Active outbreaks have now spread to 10 states.Why It Matters: This outbreak is a public health failure driven by vaccine hesitancy and disinformation, amplified by RFK Jr., whose anti-vaccine rhetoric is sabotaging containment efforts and letting a preventable disease make a deadly comeback.Source: Associated PressVA Phases Out Mortgage Rescue Program, Sparking Foreclosure Fears for VeteransWhat Happened: The Department of Veterans Affairs is shutting down the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase Program on May 1, 2025\u2014cutting off a vital lifeline that has helped thousands of struggling veterans avoid foreclosure by modifying their home loans. The move comes amid a mass purge at the VA, and no replacement program in place.Why It Matters: Tens of thousands of veterans will face a heightened risk of foreclosure, with over 80,000 already in mortgage default. Housing advocates and Democrats call the phase-out of VASP \u201ccruel,\u201d warning it will lead to a surge in preventable home losses. Source: CNNFEC to Lose Quorum After Another Commissioner ResignsWhat Happened: The Federal Election Commission has lost its quorum after Republican Allen Dickerson resigned, joining earlier departures by Sean Cooksey and Trump\u2019s controversial firing of Democrat Ellen Weintraub. With just three members left, the FEC is now unable to enforce campaign finance laws or issue official rulings.Why It Matters: This deliberate gutting of the FEC kneecaps the nation\u2019s election watchdog just as the 2026 campaign season begins, opening the door to unchecked dark money, coordination violations, and abuse\u2014another step in Trump\u2019s dismantling of democratic safeguards.Source: The HillUtah Farmers Signed Up for Federally Funded Therapy. Then the Money Stopped.What Happened: A federal program offering free mental health therapy to Utah farmers, who face suicide rates 3.5 times higher than the general population, ran out of funding in just four months. Despite overwhelming demand, state lawmakers have refused to allocate additional funds, effectively ending the life-saving initiative.Why It Matters: This is a devastating failure of public responsibility. As Trump\u2019s policies deepen financial stress and mass program cuts take hold, ending mental health support will push already-struggling rural communities toward crisis and collapse.Source: ProPublica\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHegseth Threatens Iran Over Houthis Support: \u2018You Will Pay the Consequence\u2019What Happened: Pete Hegseth issued a warning to Iran, on X, over its continued support for Yemen\u2019s Houthi militants, vowing that Tehran \u201cwill pay the consequence\u201d at a time of the U.S.'s choosing. Why It Matters: The fact that Trump\u2019s defense secretary is threatening war with Iran on social media is both reckless and insane. It raises serious questions\u2014like whether he is again planning U.S. military operations on Signal in chats with family and friends.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchLindsey Graham Pushes Russia CrackdownWhat Happened: Lindsey Graham is spearheading a bipartisan bill to slam Russia with sweeping new sanctions and impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy its oil. The effort, aimed at pressuring Putin over his genocidal war in Ukraine, has over 60 Senate co-sponsors\u2014enough to beat a filibuster\u2014and could soon have the votes to override a Trump veto.Why It Matters: Graham\u2019s move signals a rare break from Trump\u2019s fealty to Moscow, but given his long track record of caving to Trump, it\u2019s unclear whether this stand will last when Trump opposes the bill.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump\u2019s Top DC Prosecutor Nominee Facing GOP ResistanceWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s pick to oversee prosecutions in DC has smeared Capitol Police, defended January 6 insurrectionists, appeared over 150 times on Russian state media pushing Kremlin disinformation, and cozied up to extremist far-right outlets and Nazi sympathizers\u2014yet Trump is pushing him through. Why It Matters: Martin\u2019s nomination is part of Trump\u2019s broader plan to seize control of the justice system by installing loyalists. His confirmation would politicize DC\u2019s top prosecutor\u2019s office, endanger prosecutions, and turn the rule of law into a partisan weapon.

Hiring stalled across key sectors, especially in education, healthcare, and business services.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies are beginning to rattle the job market. The slowdown signals rising economic instability as employers brace for further volatility.Source: The HillU.S. Economy Shrank in First Quarter as Imports Surged Ahead of TariffsWhat Happened: U.S. GDP fell by 0.3% in Q1 2025, the first economic contraction in three years, driven largely by a historic surge in imports as businesses rushed to stock up ahead of Trump\u2019s escalating tariffs. The drag from net exports was the largest on record since 1947, while consumer spending slowed and federal spending declined due to purges and contract cuts by Musk and Trump.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff war is tanking the economy\u2014spooking markets, driving a surge in imports, and triggering a contraction in growth. Despite his blame game, the numbers don\u2019t lie, and his chaotic trade policies are dragging the U.S. into economic turmoil and a possible recession.Source: Wall Street JournalTesla Board Opened Search for a CEO to Succeed Elon MuskWhat Happened: With profits plunging 71% and Tesla\u2019s stock in decline, the company\u2019s board began a formal search for Elon Musk\u2019s successor, citing his prolonged absence and focus on Trump\u2019s regime. Last week, Musk stated he would return his attention to Tesla after investor pressure mounted.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s extremist views and actions while serving as Tesla CEO are backfiring, wrecking the brand, repelling consumers, and helping drive a collapse in profits. The board\u2019s search for a successor signals even Tesla is ready to move on from the chaos\u2014though it may be too late to undo the damage.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News5/1- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501Trump's Guantanamo Deportations Slowed by Judge's OrderWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered Trump to provide due process to migrants held at Guantanamo Bay before deporting them to third countries like El Salvador, after rights advocates argued that Trump officials violated a court order by flying four Venezuelans to El Salvador via the Defense Department.Source: USA TodayUS Judge Bars Border Patrol from Some Warrantless Arrests of Suspected Undocumented ResidentsWhat Happened: A federal judge in California ruled that Border Patrol agents cannot arrest suspected undocumented residents without a warrant unless there\u2019s a risk they may flee, nor can they coerce \u201cvoluntary\u201d departures without informing individuals of their rights and obtaining consent\u2014responding to abuses during Trump\u2019s \u201cOperation Return to Sender.\u201dSource: Associated PressPalestinian Student at Columbia Freed After Arrest at Citizenship InterviewWhat Happened: Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student and protest leader at Columbia University, was released by a federal judge after being arrested by ICE during his U.S. citizenship interview.
