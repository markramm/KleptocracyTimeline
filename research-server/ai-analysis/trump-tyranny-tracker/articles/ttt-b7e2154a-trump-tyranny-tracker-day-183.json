This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsFDA Names Former Pharmaceutical Executive to Oversee U.S. Drug ProgramWhat Happened: The FDA appointed Dr. George Tidmarsh, ex-CEO of several drug firms, to lead its drug regulation center amid sweeping staff and leadership purges. He\u2019ll oversee drug approvals and reviews, including the abortion pill.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s FDA is being remade by industry insiders and ideologues. With 3,000+ staff purged and top regulators ousted, public health oversight continues to be hollowed out and politicized.Source: Associated PressTrump Media Buys $2 Billion in Bitcoin for Crypto Treasury PlanWhat Happened: Trump Media has purchased $2 billion in Bitcoin and related securities to support its shift to a crypto treasury model. The company also allocated $300 million for Bitcoin options and plans to launch a utility token tied to Truth Social.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s media empire is gambling its future on crypto, embracing volatility to bypass oversight. It\u2019s another play for self-enrichment, financial opacity, and detachment from traditional regulation\u2014all while Trump\u2019s inner circle profits behind the scenes.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Sharpens Attacks on a Favorite Foe: The News MediaWhat Happened: Trump is escalating attacks on the press, using lawsuits, FCC pressure, and funding cuts to punish outlets. CBS pulled Colbert, Paramount paid $16 million, and The Wall Street Journal was barred from the press pool. He also posted an AI fake-arrest video of Obama to divert from Epstein coverup.Why It Matters: This is state-sponsored media suppression. Trump is weaponizing government power to silence dissent and intimidate press organizations, turning Kremlin-style repression into official policy\u2014and it\u2019s working.Source: New York TimesTrump Officials Accused of Defying 1 in 3 Judges Who Ruled Against HimWhat Happened: A Washington Post investigation found Trump officials defied court rulings in 35% of cases they lost\u2014ignoring 57 out of 165 decisions. Judges cited false claims and bad-faith actions, while whistleblowers described orders to disobey rulings on deportations, layoffs, and asylum protections.Why It Matters: Trump is treating the courts as optional, eroding the rule of law and dismantling checks on executive power through systematic defiance.Source: Washington PostTrump intervenes to boost Hegseth aide who left military for politicsWhat Happened: Trump granted Marine Col. Ricky Buria a retirement waiver to keep a higher rank he held briefly\u2014despite legal limits. Buria, tied to the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cSignalgate\u201d leak and Hegseth\u2019s loyalty purge, was fast-tracked into top roles as senior women were ousted.Why It Matters: Trump continues turning the military into a political tool, rewarding loyalists over rules. Buria\u2019s case shows how merit, law, and tradition are being gutted to cement control over the armed forces.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsPublic record contradicts US spy chief\u2019s Russia-gate \u2018conspiracy\u2019 accusationsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DNI, Tulsi Gabbard, accused Obama-era officials of conspiring to politicize Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and referred them for prosecution\u2014despite her own documents confirming no vote tampering ever occurred.Why It Matters: Gabbard. a longtime mouth piece for the Kremlin, is pushing a debunked Kremlin and MAGA lie to discredit the intelligence community and rewrite the story of Russia\u2019s attack on U.S. democracy. It\u2019s a calculated move to protect Trump and revive \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies.Source: Defense OneTrump Officials Release FBI Records on MLK Jr Despite Family\u2019s ObjectionWhat Happened: Trump released 200,000 pages of FBI surveillance files on Martin Luther King Jr., defying appeals from his children and civil rights groups. Why It Matters: The release weaponizes history to distract from Trump\u2019s Epstein scandal. King\u2019s family warns it risks degrading his legacy and aiding those who once sought to destroy the Civil Rights Movement.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Posts Fake Video Showing Obama ArrestWhat Happened: Trump shared a fake A.I. video showing Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office, pushing the lie that Obama led a 2016 plot against him.Why It Matters: Trump is using deepfakes to spread disinformation, smear enemies, and threaten prosecution. It\u2019s dangerous propaganda that further fuels conspiracy theories, erodes reality, and incites more hate.Source: New York TimesTrump bans Wall Street Journal from Scotland trip press pool over Epstein reportWhat Happened: Trump barred the Wall Street Journal from his Scotland press pool after the paper reported he sent Jeffrey Epstein a birthday letter with a nude drawing. Trump sued the outlet for $10 billion, calling the report \u201cfake and defamatory.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is another escalation in Trump\u2019s war on the press, using access as a weapon to punish critical reporting. It undermines First Amendment protections and reiterates growing press restrictions.Source: The GuardianStephen Miller\u2019s legal group asks DoJ to look into \u2018illegal DEI practices\u2019 at Johns HopkinsWhat Happened: Stephen Miller\u2019s America First Legal urged the DOJ to investigate Johns Hopkins Medical School for \u201cillegal DEI practices,\u201d accusing it of using \u201crace-based preferences.\u201d Why It Matters: This will worsen racial disparities in healthcare\u2014and it's part of a wider push to silence dissent and enforce ideological conformity across universities and schools.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Student Arrests, and the Lawsuit Fighting Them, Tread New GroundWhat Happened: Marco Rubio, revoked visas and green cards of foreign students who voiced pro-Palestinian views, citing a rarely used \u201cforeign policy interest\u201d law. Arrests followed at Tufts and Columbia, triggering a major lawsuit by academic groups.Why It Matters: By targeting political speech as grounds for deportation, Trump is rewriting the First Amendment for noncitizens\u2014and creating a chilling precedent to silence all dissent.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJudge gives ex-officer nearly 3 years in Breonna Taylor raid, rebuffs DOJ call for no prison timeWhat Happened: Former officer Brett Hankison was sentenced to 33 months in prison for firing blindly during the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor. The judge rejected the DOJ\u2019s recommendation for no prison time, calling it \u201cinappropriate.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is the sole prison sentence in the Breonna Taylor case\u2014and a  rejection of Trump\u2019s DOJ, which pushed for impunity. It reflects enduring public outrage over police violence and a justice system that too often shields abusers from consequence.Source: PoliticoMigrants at Ice jail in Miami made to kneel to eat \u2018like dogs\u2019, report allegesWhat Happened: A new report reveals migrants at ICE facilities in Florida were shackled and forced to kneel to eat, denied medical care, and held in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. At one Miami jail, detainees spent 12 days on cold concrete floors; others were left for hours on a bus reeking of feces. At Broward, a woman died after medical neglect.Why It Matters: These are not isolated abuses and reflect the systemic cruelty and human rights violations by the Trump regime. With overcrowding at historic highs and ICE empowered by extremist far-right policy, the U.S. is facing a full-blown human rights crisis.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch\u2018It\u2019s a madhouse\u2019: US state department workers reeling after Trump\u2019s firingsWhat Happened: Nearly 3,000 State Department staff were ousted under Trump\u2019s Reduction in Force order. Career diplomats say it was an illegal purge that cleared the way for far-right loyalists pushing anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigrant, and anti-choice agendas. Key programs were gutted and morale tanked.Why It Matters: Trump is replacing U.S. diplomacy with far-right extremism. As professionals are driven out, global human rights and national security are unraveling.Source: The GuardianFEMA search and rescue chief resigns after frustration with Texas flood responseWhat Happened: Ken Pagurek, head of FEMA\u2019s Urban Search and Rescue branch, resigned after Kristi Noem delayed his teams' deployment to deadly Texas floods. Noem\u2019s cost-cutting rules require her sign-off on all FEMA contracts over $100,000, causing life-threatening delays.Why It Matters: FEMA\u2019s disaster response is breaking down under Trump. Career officials are leaving in protest, search teams are showing up a week late, and new DHS rules are slowing emergency aid during climate disasters\u2014and it\u2019s putting lives at risk.Source: CNNGovernment\u2019s H.R. Arm Shedding a Third of StaffWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management is shrinking from 3,110 to 2,000 employees, with over 750 taking buyouts and 129 purged. Under Trump appointee Scott Kupor, the agency is also halving its contractor workforce in a broader purge.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s blueprint to dismantle the federal workforce. By gutting agencies and driving out civil servants, he\u2019s hollowing out the government\u2019s core capacity.Source: New York TimesBudget office says Trump\u2019s tax law will add $3.4 trillion to deficits, leave 10 million uninsuredWhat Happened: The CBO assesses that Trump\u2019s new tax law will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit by 2034 and leave 10 million more people uninsured. The law slashes Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy credits while boosting tax breaks for cars and tips.Why It Matters: This is a massive wealth grab. Trump\u2019s policies reward the rich, deepen inequality, and leave Americans with exploding debt\u2014all while peddling false promises of growth.Source: Associated PressAs US wildfires rage, Trump staff cuts force firefighters to clean toilets, critics sayWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s buyout plan and purges cut 15% of the Forest Service workforce, leaving firefighters to do janitorial work and answer phones. Crews face food, fuel, and medical shortages as wildfires hit decade highs.Why It Matters: Gutting the Forest Service during a climate-driven fire surge puts lives at risk. Source: ReutersDisabled Americans Fear What Medicaid Cuts Could Do to ThemWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new law slashes $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade. While the White House claims home and community based care won\u2019t be affected, experts warn that services for 4.5 million disabled Americans\u2014especially children\u2014are at risk.Why It Matters: These cuts threaten basic care that keeps people out of institutions. Families will lose vital nursing, therapy, and medical supplies\u2014forcing impossible choices and deepening the crisis for the most vulnerable.Source: New York TimesTexas Lawmakers Largely Ignored Recommendations Aimed at Helping Rural Areas Like Kerr County Prepare for FloodingWhat Happened: Texas lawmakers ignored a 2024 flood plan and failed to pass key protections before July 4 flash floods killed over 100 in Kerr County. They prioritized tax cuts and drought measures instead, rejecting siren systems, drainage upgrades, and rural support.Why It Matters: State leaders chose austerity over safety, leaving rural Texans vulnerable as climate-driven storms worsen. The state is gambling with lives as climate-fueled storms grow more deadly.Source: ProPublica\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchState Department Confirms China Barred US Citizen From LeavingWhat Happened: A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employee has been under an exit ban in China since April, reportedly for failing to disclose his government job on a visa application.

Over half of Canadians are cutting U.S. travel and purchases in response, while Ford pushes to boost local production of vehicles, steel, and aluminum.Why It Matters: With U.S.-Canada tensions rising, consumer backlash is growing. Canada is America\u2019s top customer\u2014and this boycott, paired with domestic manufacturing shifts, will hit U.S. exporters hard as Trump\u2019s unnecessary trade war escalates.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchUK Sanctions Russian Spies for Malicious Cyber ActivityWhat Happened: The UK sanctioned 18 GRU officers and 3 Russian military intelligence units for cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, including spyware targeting Yulia Skripal. The move is part of a coordinated effort with the EU\u2019s latest sanctions round against Russia.Why It Matters: This is the UK\u2019s biggest spy-related action since Russia\u2019s 2018 Salisbury poisonings. It signals intensifying Western resolve to punish Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare, even as Russia escalates attacks and evades sanctions via shadow oil fleets and global influence ops.Source: BBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsU.S. homebuilders head into back half of 2025 with rising costs, tariff uncertaintyWhat Happened: Homebuilders are struggling with soaring material prices, high interest rates, and looming Trump tariffs that could hike costs by up to 10%.

He said the Fed\u2019s expanded reach warrants greater oversight.Why It Matters: A politicized Fed review threatens the bedrock of U.S. economic stability\u2014central bank independence. Trump\u2019s attack on Powell is about control. Source: ReutersStellantis Says Profit Plunged as Tariffs Began to BiteWhat Happened: Stellantis reported a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of 2025, blaming Trump\u2019s tariffs and policy changes. Tariffs alone cost \u20ac300 million, while clean air credit losses and factory shutdowns hit sales hard, especially in the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade and deregulation agenda is roiling the auto industry. Rising costs, production delays, and regulatory uncertainty are forcing price hikes\u2014undermining competitiveness and hurting consumers.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News8/2- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Harvard Argues Trump Illegally Cut $2.6 Billion in Research FundingWhat Happened: Harvard challenged Trump in court over $2.6 billion in slashed research funds, calling it illegal retaliation for resisting federal demands on campus protests and hiring.
