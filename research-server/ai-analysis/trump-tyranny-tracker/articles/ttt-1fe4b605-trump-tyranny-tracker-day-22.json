  "content": "It will take some time, though perhaps only weeks, for a challenge to one of President Trump\u2019s actions to reach the Supreme Court.Credit: Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 10Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Recruited His Fake DOGE Operatives Through Palantir and SpaceX NetworksWhat Happened: New reports reveal that Musk recruited engineers from Palantir, SpaceX, and Thiel-affiliated networks via private Discord servers and online chat groups. Some of these recruits now have access to all sensitive government systems, including at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Energy. And, these are the people stealing all of our sensitive information.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s use of Silicon Valley tech networks to embed operatives across federal agencies is alarming and a national security threat. Many of the operatives are unvetted and lack government experience, yet have gained access to highly sensitive federal data. The connections to Peter Thiel and Palantir\u2014a firm deeply tied to intelligence and military contracts\u2014further blur the lines between private corporate interests and government operations, accelerating Musk\u2019s unchecked power grab.Source: WIREDTrump Halts Enforcement of Foreign Bribery BanWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order suspending enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which has banned U.S. firms from bribing foreign officials since 1977. He directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to draft new guidelines for enforcement, arguing that the law hinders U.S. businesses in global markets.Why It Matters: The FCPA is a key anti-corruption tool that prevents corporate bribery and fraud. Trump\u2019s rollback risks is meant to increase corruption, undermine U.S. credibility, and weaken the rule of law\u2014all while benefiting politically connected businesses mirroring Russia.Source: CNBCTrump\u2019s $Trump Coin Enriches Insiders, Leaves Investors with $2B in LossesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s $Trump cryptocurrency launched days before his inauguration, sending prices from $0.18 to $75 before crashing. Early insiders made millions, while over 800,000 investors lost a combined $2 billion. Trump and his family pocketed nearly $100 million in fees.Why It Matters: This was a pump-and-dump scheme, but with Trump profiting and insiders profiting. Meanwhile, his regime is removing crypto regulations which will benefit Trump and his at the public\u2019s expense.Source: New York TimesMusk Guts the Federal Government While His Companies Have Received Billions in Government Contracts What Happened: While Musk guts the federal government, his companies SpaceX and Tesla have received over $18 billion in government contracts in the past decade. SpaceX alone earned $13 billion from NASA, making the agency its largest customer. The company also won billions in defense contracts under both Trump and Biden.Why It Matters: Musk's role as both the executioner of federal agencies and a primary beneficiary of government contracts is an outrageous conflict of interest full of corruption. His unchecked power mirrors oligarchic state capture, where a billionaire reshapes governance to serve his own interests. Musk\u2019s $280 million purchase of the White House continues to pay off\u2014he\u2019s been handed unchecked executive power with zero vetting, no financial disclosures, and total immunity from oversight.Source: ABC NewsTrump Pardons Corrupt Former Illinois Gov. Rod BlagojevichWhat Happened: Trump pardoned Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama\u2019s vacated Senate seat and engaging in multiple corruption schemes. Blagojevich, sentenced to 14 years in prison, had his sentence commuted by Trump in 2020 and has since aligned himself as a \"Trump-ocrat.\"Why It Matters: This is yet another example of Trump rewarding political allies and normalizing corruption. By erasing Blagojevich\u2019s record, Trump signals that public office can be abused for personal gain without consequences, further dismantling integrity in government. Source: NPR\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Purges Government Ethics Watchdogs, Weakens Anti-Corruption LawsWhat Happened: Trump fired multiple inspectors general, forced out public integrity officials, and halted enforcement of anti-bribery laws. On Monday, he removed the heads of the Office of Government Ethics and Office of Special Counsel, which handles whistleblower complaints, eliminating key safeguards against corruption. Why It Matters: By gutting oversight mechanisms and stacking the DOJ with loyalists, Trump is ensuring his regime faces no legal scrutiny. His mass firings of watchdogs and prosecutors are part of Trump\u2019s consolidation of power, where ethics rules and corruption laws no longer apply. With no meaningful guardrails left, Trump is dismantling the institutions designed to hold government accountable, creating an environment ripe for political and financial corruption. Source: Associated PressMusk Calls for Impeachment of Judge Who Blocked Fake DOGE Access at TreasuryWhat Happened: Musk called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer after the judge issued an emergency ruling blocking Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE operatives from accessing the Treasury Department\u2019s payment system. The ruling, in response to a lawsuit by 19 Democratic attorneys general, orders anyone who accessed Treasury systems to destroy downloaded materials immediately. Musk lashed out on X, calling the judge \u201ccorrupt\u201d and demanding his removal.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s open attack on the judiciary signals a growing executive-judicial conflict as courts block Trump and Musk\u2019s overreach. DOGE\u2019s illegal access to the $5 trillion Treasury system raised fears of financial manipulation, hacking risks, and unauthorized cuts to congressional funds. Musk\u2019s demand for impeachment further exposes Trump\u2019s war on independent oversight as his regime consolidates power.Source: The HillTrump Removes Government Ethics Office DirectorWhat Happened: Trump removed David Huitema, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, a watchdog responsible for enforcing ethics and conflict of interest rules for federal officials. The firing, quietly announced on the OGE website, follows Trump\u2019s broader purge of oversight officials, including prosecutors handling Jan. 6 cases.Why It Matters: This eliminates another check on Trump\u2019s regimes, allowing his cronies\u2014including Elon Musk and unvetted DOGE operatives\u2014to evade scrutiny. Lawmakers are demanding answers on whether Musk has disclosed his financial interests or been granted waivers to bypass federal ethics laws. With Trump dismantling ethics enforcement, his regime continues to consolidate power with zero accountability.Source: PoliticoMusk 19-Year-Old Operative Appointed to Senior Roles at State Department and DHSWhat Happened: Edward Coristine aka Big Balls, a 19-year-old Musk operative, has taken on key roles at the State Department, DHS, FEMA, and USAID, despite being unvetted. His appointment reflects Musk\u2019s deepening control over federal agencies and access to America\u2019s most sensitive secrets.Why It Matters: Coristine\u2019s access to sensitive intelligence poses a major national security risk. With unvetted Musk operatives in key agencies, classified information will be compromised or sold. This dangerous infiltration prioritizes loyalty over expertise, risking U.S. allies cutting intelligence ties and weakening national security.Source: Washington PostTrump Cripples Federal Labor Board, Blocking Union ProtectionsWhat Happened: Trump fired NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board unable to function, just as Amazon seeks to overturn a Whole Foods union election. Wilcox is suing, arguing her removal is illegal and undermines the board\u2019s independence.Why It Matters: The NLRB safeguards workers' rights, but with too few members, it cannot enforce union protections or labor law. Trump will stall appointments and then install a loyalist to keep the agency powerless, crippling collective bargaining and handing corporations free rein to crush unions.Source: CBS NewsFTC Appoints Heritage Foundation Alum as Chief Tech Officer  What Happened: The Federal Trade Commission has appointed Jake Denton, a former Heritage Foundation tech policy researcher, as its new chief technology officer. Why It Matters: Denton\u2019s appointment marks a shift toward conservative tech policy, aligning with Trump\u2019s broader regulatory overhaul. As FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson considers scaling back investigations into Microsoft, OpenAI, and Amazon, Denton\u2019s ties to the Heritage Foundation raise concerns about weakened antitrust enforcement. Also, Heritage\u2019s Project 2025 has questioned whether the FTC should exist.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJustice Department Drops Corruption Charges Against NYC Mayor Eric AdamsWhat Happened: The Justice Department, under acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. The decision was not based on evidence but rather concerns that the trial would interfere with Adams\u2019 reelection campaign and his focus on immigration. Adams was indicted for allegedly accepting bribes and engaging in illegal foreign influence schemes.Why It Matters: The DOJ\u2019s move exposes Trump\u2019s use of law enforcement as a political weapon, dropping charges to secure compliance while keeping the threat of prosecution hanging over Adam\u2019s head. If Adams fails to deliver on immigration or Trump\u2019s other demands, his charges could be reinstated\u2014a classic tactic used in Russia.Source: Washington PostDHS Moves to Deputize IRS Agents for Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security has requested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to deputize IRS criminal investigators to assist in Trump\u2019s mass deportation effort. In a memo dated Feb. 7, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked for IRS agents to help track financial flows, investigate businesses employing undocumented immigrants, and participate in arrests and detentions. Why It Matters: Trump is expanding his immigration crackdown by weaponizing federal agencies beyond DHS, turning tax investigators into immigration enforcers. The move blurs legal boundaries, shifts IRS agents, and signals a further weaponization of government institutions under Trump\u2019s rule. This effort reflects the regime\u2019s authoritarian ambitions, using federal law enforcement as an extension of political power rather than its intended purpose.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Revokes Security Clearance for Blinken, Plans More Retaliatory StrikesWhat Happened: Trump revoked the security clearance of former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling him a \u201cbad guy,\u201d and plans to strip clearances from NY Attorney General Letitia James and DA Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted him. Trump is also targeting former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, ex-Deputy AG Lisa Monaco, and legal figures tied to investigations into him.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s moves weaponize security clearances against political opponents, marking a continued escalation of authoritarian tactics. By targeting prosecutors and legal figures involved in past investigations, Trump is using state power for personal revenge, further undermining U.S. institutions and the rule of law.Source: The GuardianTrump Expands Retaliatory Security Clearance RevocationsWhat Happened: Trump ordered the revocation of security clearances for officials and lawyers who opposed him, including Mark Zaid, the attorney who represented the whistleblower in Trump\u2019s first impeachment over his Ukraine extortion scandal.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s escalation of personal vendettas weaponizes state power to punish legal professionals, setting a dangerous precedent that erodes democratic norms and the rule of law. Mark Zaid, a prominent whistleblower attorney, represents many federal officials and intelligence personnel, making him even more critical as Trump intensifies his crackdown.Source: New York PostTrump could remake USAID to promote fossil fuelsWhat Happened: The Trump regime froze foreign aid for 90 days, began dismantling USAID, and Trump may shift its mission toward fossil fuel promotion. Following Project 2025, this move aims to eliminate climate programs and redirect aid to oil and gas projects, despite a judge blocking mass layoffs at the agency.Why It Matters: The overhaul would gut climate initiatives and divert taxpayer dollars to support fossil fuels abroad, completely distorting USAID\u2019s original mission of global development and humanitarian aid.Source: PoliticoSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsGoogle Renames \u2018Gulf of America\u2019 After Trump\u2019s Executive OrderWhat Happened: Google Maps has officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" for U.S. users, following Trump\u2019s executive order on his first day back in office. The Interior Department declared the change \u201ceffective immediately\u201d, and Google complied after the U.S. Geographic Names Information System updated its records. Trump also proclaimed February 9 as \"Gulf of America Day.\"Why It Matters: This nationalist rebranding showcases Trump\u2019s authoritarian grip over federal agencies and private companies, forcing compliance with his extremist political agenda. Source: The HillJudge Rules Trump is Violating Order to Lift Spending FreezeWhat Happened: U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled that the Trump regime is violating his order to restore funding that was frozen under a blanket spending freeze last month. Trump must immediately resume payments for NIH grants, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act.Why It Matters: The judge warned that continuing to block funds could lead to contempt charges for officials defying the ruling. The Trump regime\u2019s false justification\u2014rooting out fraud\u2014was rejected since the freezes were not based on specific fraud findings but rather a broad, unconstitutional freeze affecting critical programs.Source: PoliticoTrump Again Floats a Third Term, Fueling Authoritarian ConcernsWhat Happened: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment barring it. At public events and private meetings, he has joked about extending his presidency, while GOP lawmakers like Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick have openly pushed for constitutional changes to allow it.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s rhetoric normalizes an indefinite presidency, a hallmark of authoritarianism. His power grabs, Musk\u2019s dismantling of agencies, and GOP calls for constitutional changes signal this is no joke\u2014it\u2019s a real threat to democracy.Source: New York TimesTrump Allies Suggest Defying Courts After Legal DefeatsWhat Happened: After federal judges blocked multiple Trump executive orders, key allies hinted at defying judicial authority. Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon Musk argued judges shouldn\u2019t limit executive power, with Musk demanding the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against his DOGE initiative. Meanwhile, a Rhode Island judge accused the regime of violating a court order to restore frozen federal funds, warning of possible penalties.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s inner circle is openly attacking the judiciary, laying the groundwork to ignore court rulings and consolidate unchecked power. This is a clear authoritarian move, aimed at eroding the rule of law and weakening judicial oversight. If Trump and his allies continue down this path, the courts\u2014the last institutional check on his power\u2014could be rendered irrelevant.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s Legal Assault on the Media Gains TractionWhat Happened: Trump is weaponizing consumer protection laws to sue media outlets, including CBS and The Des Moines Register, claiming deceptive journalism. While legal experts call the cases baseless, the strategy is proving effective, forcing outlets into costly legal battles and even settlements.Why It Matters: These lawsuits, Trump\u2019s weaponized FCC investigations, and Trump\u2019s attacks on press freedoms signal an escalating authoritarian crackdown on independent journalism. By intimidating and financially draining media organizations, Trump is eroding the First Amendment\u2019s protections, paving the way for state-controlled propaganda.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Freezes Civil Rights Enforcement at Education DepartmentWhat Happened: The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has been ordered to halt external communications, delaying investigations into discrimination complaints. Staff can only acknowledge receipt of cases, paralyzing enforcement as Trump moves to abolish the department and shift civil rights oversight to his DOJ.Why It Matters: The freeze blocks protections for students facing discrimination, leaving families without recourse. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s regime is prioritizing politically driven probes, advancing Project 2025\u2019s agenda to overturn civil rights enforcement.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf10 Imperial WatchTrump Threatens to Withhold Aid to Jordan, Egypt Over Gaza Refugee PlanWhat Happened: Trump said he may cut U.S. aid to Jordan and Egypt if they refuse to take in Palestinian refugees as part of his plan for the U.S. to illegally seize and occupy Gaza. Both countries have rejected the idea, citing security risks and regional instability. Why It Matters: This coercive diplomacy will destabilize U.S. alliances in the Middle East, fuel anti-American sentiment, endanger U.S. military, and escalate regional tensions. By pushing illegal permanent displacement of Palestinians, Trump\u2019s imperialist agenda mirrors Russian tactics and will spark a widespread Arab world backlash.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge Temporarily Reinstates Fired Whistleblower Protection ChiefWhat Happened: A federal judge reinstated Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel after he was abruptly fired by Trump. The ruling blocks his removal until Thursday, allowing him to resume oversight of whistleblower protections and Hatch Act violations.Source: The HillLabor Unions Sue to Block DOGE Access to Sensitive Government DataWhat Happened: A coalition of labor unions, led by the American Federation of Teachers, filed a lawsuit against the Trump regime, seeking to block Elon Musk from accessing personal data at the Education Department, Treasury Department, and Office of Personnel Management. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Maryland, argues that DOGE\u2019s access violates federal privacy laws and puts tens of millions of Americans at risk. Source: Associated PressJudge Further Blocks Trump\u2019s \u2018Fork in the Road\u2019 Resignation PlanWhat Happened: A federal judge extended the pause on Trump\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d resignation program for federal employees, which forced them to choose between resigning or facing mass layoffs and loyalty demands. The regime claims the program is a \u201chumane offramp\u201d, while labor unions and state attorneys general argue it\u2019s an unlawful purge of career civil servants.Source: NPRFederal Judge Blocks Trump\u2019s NIH Funding CutsWhat Happened: A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked Trump\u2019s attempt to slash NIH funding by capping what universities and research organizations receive for administrative costs. This follows another ruling earlier in the day, where a judge accused the regime of ignoring a court order to disburse grant funding, hinting at potential penalties for noncompliance.Source: Washington PostTrump Admin Faces Lawsuits Over CFPB Shutdown & DOGE Data AccessWhat Happened: A federal employees union sued to block the shutdown of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and stop Elon Musk from accessing employee records. Acting CFPB director Russell Vought ordered staff to cease all investigations and rulemaking, effectively paralyzing the agency.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers$18B+: Total federal contracts awarded to Elon Musk\u2019s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, over the past decade.$2B+: Investor losses from Trump\u2019s $Trump Coin crypto scheme.90 days: Length of Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze, crippling USAID operations.800,000+: Number of investors affected by the $Trump Coin crash.2M federal employees: Offered \"Fork in the Road\" buyouts, forcing loyalty pledges or resignations.40+ lawsuits: Filed in recent days challenging Trump\u2019s executive orders and agency overhauls.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextCourts vs. Trump: More lawsuits challenging Musk\u2019s infiltration and overreach, whistleblower firings, and mass deportation plans could result in key rulings.Constitutional Crisis in the Making: Will the Trump regime defy court rulings?Mass Deportations: DHS\u2019s plan to deputize IRS agents for immigration enforcement raises concerns of civil rights abuses.\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump Targets Watchdogs: The purge of ethics officials, inspectors general, and whistleblower protection leaders removes key safeguards against corruption and consolidation of power.Judiciary Under Siege: Trump cronies, including the VP, openly suggest defying court rulings, while Musk calls for the impeachment of judges who block their agenda.Weaponization of Institutions: The DOJ drops corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams while ramping up legal attacks on political enemies.

</span><strong>Thiel-affiliated networks via private Discord servers</strong><span> and </span><strong>online chat groups</strong><span>. Some of these recruits now have access to all sensitive government systems, including at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Energy. And, these are the people stealing all of our sensitive information.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Musk\u2019s use of Silicon Valley tech networks to embed operatives across federal agencies is alarming and a national security threat. Many of the operatives are unvetted and lack government experience, yet have gained access to highly sensitive federal data. The connections to Peter Thiel and Palantir\u2014a firm deeply tied to intelligence and military contracts\u2014further blur the lines between private corporate interests and government operations, accelerating Musk\u2019s unchecked power grab.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/\" rel=\"\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>Trump Halts Enforcement of Foreign Bribery Ban</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trump-halts-enforcement-of-foreign-bribery-ban\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/156813614/trump-halts-enforcement-of-foreign-bribery-ban\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump signed an executive order suspending enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which has banned U.S. firms from bribing foreign officials since 1977.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 10</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Musk Recruited His Fake DOGE Operatives Through Palantir and SpaceX Networks</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> New reports reveal that Musk recruited engineers from Palantir, SpaceX, and <strong>Thiel-affiliated networks via private Discord servers</strong> and <strong>online chat groups</strong>. Some of these recruits now have access to all sensitive government systems, including at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Energy. And, these are the people stealing all of our sensitive information.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s use of Silicon Valley tech networks to embed operatives across federal agencies is alarming and a national security threat. Many of the operatives are unvetted and lack government experience, yet have gained access to highly sensitive federal data. The connections to Peter Thiel and Palantir\\u2014a firm deeply tied to intelligence and military contracts\\u2014further blur the lines between private corporate interests and government operations, accelerating Musk\\u2019s unchecked power grab.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Halts Enforcement of Foreign Bribery Ban</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order suspending enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which has banned U.S. firms from bribing foreign officials since 1977. He directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to draft new guidelines for enforcement, arguing that the law hinders U.S. businesses in global markets.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The FCPA is a key anti-corruption tool that prevents corporate bribery and fraud. Trump\\u2019s rollback risks is meant to increase corruption, undermine U.S. credibility, and weaken the rule of law\\u2014all while benefiting politically connected businesses mirroring Russia.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/trump-doj-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-pause.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s $Trump Coin Enriches Insiders, Leaves Investors with $2B in Losses</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s $Trump cryptocurrency launched days before his inauguration, sending prices from $0.18 to $75 before crashing. Early insiders made millions, while over 800,000 investors lost a combined $2 billion. Trump and his family pocketed nearly $100 million in fees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This was a pump-and-dump scheme, but with Trump profiting and insiders profiting. Meanwhile, his regime is removing crypto regulations which will benefit Trump and his at the public\\u2019s expense.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/trump-crypto-memecoin.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Musk Guts the Federal Government While His Companies Have Received Billions in Government Contracts </h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> While Musk guts the federal government, his companies SpaceX and Tesla have received over $18 billion in government contracts in the past decade. SpaceX alone earned $13 billion from NASA, making the agency its largest customer. The company also won billions in defense contracts under both Trump and Biden.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk's role as both the executioner of federal agencies and a primary beneficiary of government contracts is an outrageous conflict of interest full of corruption. His unchecked power mirrors oligarchic state capture, where a billionaire reshapes governance to serve his own interests. Musk\\u2019s $280 million purchase of the White House continues to pay off\\u2014he\\u2019s been handed unchecked executive power with zero vetting, no financial disclosures, and total immunity from oversight.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/musk-works-slash-federal-spending-firms-received-billions/story?id=118589121\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Pardons Corrupt Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump pardoned Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor convicted of trying to sell Barack Obama\\u2019s vacated Senate seat and engaging in multiple corruption schemes. Blagojevich, sentenced to 14 years in prison, had his sentence commuted by Trump in 2020 and has since aligned himself as a \\\\\\\"Trump-ocrat.\\\\\\\"</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is yet another example of Trump rewarding political allies and normalizing corruption. By erasing Blagojevich\\u2019s record, Trump signals that public office can be abused for personal gain without consequences, further dismantling integrity in government. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/10/g-s1-47817/trump-pardons-disgraced-former-illinois-gov-rod-blagojevich\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Purges Government Ethics Watchdogs, Weakens Anti-Corruption Laws</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired multiple inspectors general, forced out public integrity officials, and halted enforcement of anti-bribery laws. On Monday, he removed the heads of the Office of Government Ethics and Office of Special Counsel, which handles whistleblower complaints, eliminating key safeguards against corruption. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By gutting oversight mechanisms and stacking the DOJ with loyalists, Trump is ensuring his regime faces no legal scrutiny. His mass firings of watchdogs and prosecutors are part of Trump\\u2019s consolidation of power, where ethics rules and corruption laws no longer apply. With no meaningful guardrails left, Trump is dismantling the institutions designed to hold government accountable, creating an environment ripe for political and financial corruption. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-inspectors-general-firing-justice-department-902d19ae20bcd10c2d11e92dd902d85e\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Calls for Impeachment of Judge Who Blocked Fake DOGE Access at Treasury</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer after the judge issued an emergency ruling blocking Musk\\u2019s unauthorized DOGE operatives from accessing the Treasury Department\\u2019s payment system. The ruling, in response to a lawsuit by 19 Democratic attorneys general, orders anyone who accessed Treasury systems to destroy downloaded materials immediately. Musk lashed out on X, calling the judge \\u201Ccorrupt\\u201D and demanding his removal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s open attack on the judiciary signals a growing executive-judicial conflict as courts block Trump and Musk\\u2019s overreach. DOGE\\u2019s illegal access to the $5 trillion Treasury system raised fears of financial manipulation, hacking risks, and unauthorized cuts to congressional funds. Musk\\u2019s demand for impeachment further exposes Trump\\u2019s war on independent oversight as his regime consolidates power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5134725-elon-musk-impeachment-demand/?email=066c0990fa413d52c3842f29a42abb22ffa00eae&amp;emaila=02c3337a6605235631b8cab2e023d54e&amp;emailb=e0d37ab6f97ed06914f0e75a1ebed673001a81f7f84978ff9209f3e23f7ba5d3&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=02.09.25EL-News%20Alert-Musk%20impeachment\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Removes Government Ethics Office Director</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump removed David Huitema, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, a watchdog responsible for enforcing ethics and conflict of interest rules for federal officials. The firing, quietly announced on the OGE website, follows Trump\\u2019s broader purge of oversight officials, including prosecutors handling Jan. 6 cases.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This eliminates another check on Trump\\u2019s regimes, allowing his cronies\\u2014including Elon Musk and unvetted DOGE operatives\\u2014to evade scrutiny. Lawmakers are demanding answers on whether Musk has disclosed his financial interests or been granted waivers to bypass federal ethics laws. With Trump dismantling ethics enforcement, his regime continues to consolidate power with zero accountability.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-removes-government-ethics-office-director-00203418\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk 19-Year-Old Operative Appointed to Senior Roles at State Department and DHS</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Edward Coristine aka Big Balls, a 19-year-old Musk operative, has taken on key roles at the State Department, DHS, FEMA, and USAID, despite being unvetted. His appointment reflects Musk\\u2019s deepening control over federal agencies and access to America\\u2019s most sensitive secrets.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Coristine\\u2019s access to sensitive intelligence poses a major national security risk. With unvetted Musk operatives in key agencies, classified information will be compromised or sold. This dangerous infiltration prioritizes loyalty over expertise, risking U.S. allies cutting intelligence ties and weakening national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/10/musk-doge-state-department-surrogate/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Cripples Federal Labor Board, Blocking Union Protections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board unable to function, just as Amazon seeks to overturn a Whole Foods union election. Wilcox is suing, arguing her removal is illegal and undermines the board\\u2019s independence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The NLRB safeguards workers' rights, but with too few members, it cannot enforce union protections or labor law. Trump will stall appointments and then install a loyalist to keep the agency powerless, crippling collective bargaining and handing corporations free rein to crush unions.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nlrb-national-labor-relations-board-gwynne-wilcox/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>FTC Appoints Heritage Foundation Alum as Chief Tech Officer  </h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Federal Trade Commission has appointed Jake Denton, a former Heritage Foundation tech policy researcher, as its new chief technology officer. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Denton\\u2019s appointment marks a shift toward conservative tech policy, aligning with Trump\\u2019s broader regulatory overhaul. As FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson considers scaling back investigations into Microsoft, OpenAI, and Amazon, Denton\\u2019s ties to the Heritage Foundation raise concerns about weakened antitrust enforcement. Also, Heritage\\u2019s Project 2025 has questioned whether the FTC should exist.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ftc-hires-heritage-foundation-policy-alum-tech-chief-2025-02-10/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Justice Department Drops Corruption Charges Against NYC Mayor Eric Adams</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Justice Department, under acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. The decision was not based on evidence but rather concerns that the trial would interfere with Adams\\u2019 reelection campaign and his focus on immigration. Adams was indicted for allegedly accepting bribes and engaging in illegal foreign influence schemes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The DOJ\\u2019s move exposes Trump\\u2019s use of law enforcement as a political weapon, dropping charges to secure compliance while keeping the threat of prosecution hanging over Adam\\u2019s head. If Adams fails to deliver on immigration or Trump\\u2019s other demands, his charges could be reinstated\\u2014a classic tactic used in Russia.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/10/new-york-mayor-eric-adams-charges-drop-justice/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DHS Moves to Deputize IRS Agents for Immigration Crackdown</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security has requested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to deputize IRS criminal investigators to assist in Trump\\u2019s mass deportation effort. In a memo dated Feb. 7, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem asked for IRS agents to help track financial flows, investigate businesses employing undocumented immigrants, and participate in arrests and detentions. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is expanding his immigration crackdown by weaponizing federal agencies beyond DHS, turning tax investigators into immigration enforcers. The move blurs legal boundaries, shifts IRS agents, and signals a further weaponization of government institutions under Trump\\u2019s rule. This effort reflects the regime\\u2019s authoritarian ambitions, using federal law enforcement as an extension of political power rather than its intended purpose.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-irs-officers-ice-deportations-ed87c4b5?mod=hp_lead_pos4\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Revokes Security Clearance for Blinken, Plans More Retaliatory Strikes</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump revoked the security clearance of former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling him a \\u201Cbad guy,\\u201D and plans to strip clearances from NY Attorney General Letitia James and DA Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted him. Trump is also targeting former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, ex-Deputy AG Lisa Monaco, and legal figures tied to investigations into him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s moves weaponize security clearances against political opponents, marking a continued escalation of authoritarian tactics. By targeting prosecutors and legal figures involved in past investigations, Trump is using state power for personal revenge, further undermining U.S. institutions and the rule of law.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-revokes-antony-blinken-security-clearance\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Expands Retaliatory Security Clearance Revocations</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered the revocation of security clearances for officials and lawyers who opposed him, including Mark Zaid, the attorney who represented the whistleblower in Trump\\u2019s first impeachment over his Ukraine extortion scandal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s escalation of personal vendettas weaponizes state power to punish legal professionals, setting a dangerous precedent that erodes democratic norms and the rule of law. Mark Zaid, a prominent whistleblower attorney, represents many federal officials and intelligence personnel, making him even more critical as Trump intensifies his crackdown.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://nypost.com/2025/02/08/us-news/trump-stripping-the-security-clearances-from-a-new-hit-list-of-antagonists-including-ny-ag-letitia-james-da-alvin-bragg/\\\\\\\">New York Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump could remake USAID to promote fossil fuels</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Trump regime froze foreign aid for 90 days, began dismantling USAID, and Trump may shift its mission toward fossil fuel promotion. Following Project 2025, this move aims to eliminate climate programs and redirect aid to oil and gas projects, despite a judge blocking mass layoffs at the agency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The overhaul would gut climate initiatives and divert taxpayer dollars to support fossil fuels abroad, completely distorting USAID\\u2019s original mission of global development and humanitarian aid.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-could-remake-usaid-to-promote-fossil-fuels-main-00202958\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Google Renames \\u2018Gulf of America\\u2019 After Trump\\u2019s Executive Order</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Google Maps has officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the \\\\\\\"Gulf of America\\\\\\\" for U.S. users, following Trump\\u2019s executive order on his first day back in office.

Trump must immediately resume payments for NIH grants, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The judge warned that continuing to block funds could lead to contempt charges for officials defying the ruling. The Trump regime\\u2019s false justification\\u2014rooting out fraud\\u2014was rejected since the freezes were not based on specific fraud findings but rather a broad, unconstitutional freeze affecting critical programs.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/spending-freeze-donald-trump-015514\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Again Floats a Third Term, Fueling Authoritarian Concerns</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of serving a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment barring it. At public events and private meetings, he has joked about extending his presidency, while GOP lawmakers like Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick have openly pushed for constitutional changes to allow it.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s rhetoric normalizes an indefinite presidency, a hallmark of authoritarianism. His power grabs, Musk\\u2019s dismantling of agencies, and GOP calls for constitutional changes signal this is no joke\\u2014it\\u2019s a real threat to democracy.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/us/politics/trump-third-term.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Allies Suggest Defying Courts After Legal Defeats</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> After federal judges blocked multiple Trump executive orders, key allies hinted at defying judicial authority. Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon Musk argued judges shouldn\\u2019t limit executive power, with Musk demanding the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against his DOGE initiative. Meanwhile, a Rhode Island judge accused the regime of violating a court order to restore frozen federal funds, warning of possible penalties.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s inner circle is openly attacking the judiciary, laying the groundwork to ignore court rulings and consolidate unchecked power. This is a clear authoritarian move, aimed at eroding the rule of law and weakening judicial oversight. If Trump and his allies continue down this path, the courts\\u2014the last institutional check on his power\\u2014could be rendered irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/10/trump-judges-vance-musk-defy-orders/\\\\\\\"> Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Legal Assault on the Media Gains Traction</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is weaponizing consumer protection laws to sue media outlets, including CBS and <em>The Des Moines Register</em>, claiming deceptive journalism. While legal experts call the cases baseless, the strategy is proving effective, forcing outlets into costly legal battles and even settlements.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These lawsuits, Trump\\u2019s weaponized FCC investigations, and Trump\\u2019s attacks on press freedoms signal an escalating authoritarian crackdown on independent journalism. By intimidating and financially draining media organizations, Trump is eroding the First Amendment\\u2019s protections, paving the way for state-controlled propaganda.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/media/trump-media-lawsuits.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Freezes Civil Rights Enforcement at Education Department</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Education Department\\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has been ordered to halt external communications, delaying investigations into discrimination complaints. Staff can only acknowledge receipt of cases, paralyzing enforcement as Trump moves to abolish the department and shift civil rights oversight to his DOJ.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The freeze blocks protections for students facing discrimination, leaving families without recourse.
