(Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 7Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk\u2019s Starlink Expands in Federal GovernmentWhat Happened: Despite Trump and Musk\u2019s vow to \u201cslash\u201d federal spending, Musk\u2019s Starlink is being rapidly adopted across federal agencies, including the GSA, FAA, and CBP\u2014often bypassing standard review processes. The General Services Administration installed Starlink within days of Musk requesting it, a process that typically takes weeks or months.Why It Matters: Musk, as a senior Trump adviser and CEO of SpaceX, is gutting U.S. agencies while profiting from contracts, creating a blatant conflict of interest. His ability to unilaterally control internet access during crises gives him outsized influence over national security and emergency response.Source: NBC NewsHUD Considers Crypto Experiment Amid Trump\u2019s Push for Digital AssetsWhat Happened: The Department of Housing and Urban Development is discussing using blockchain and stablecoins to monitor federal grants, with some officials fearing it could pave the way for broader government adoption of cryptocurrency. Why It Matters: This raises serious concerns about financial stability, fraud, and deregulation, particularly given Trump's ties to the crypto industry and his regime\u2019s pro-crypto stance. Officials warn it could introduce an unregulated financial instrument into the housing market, echoing risks seen in the 2008 crisis.Source: ProPublicaTether CEO Defends Cooperation with Trump What Happened: Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, the world\u2019s most traded cryptocurrency, defended the company\u2019s close ties to Trump\u2019s cronies, claiming, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been shady.\u201d Tether, backed by Trump aide Howard Lutnick, now holds $140 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds\u2014making it the 17th largest holder of U.S. government debt.Why It Matters: Tether\u2019s transformation from a target of regulatory scrutiny to a key government ally under Trump underscores corruption, financial secrecy, and money laundering risks. Its growing influence within the regime raises alarms over conflicts of interest and potential manipulation of U.S. monetary policy and financial regulations.Source: The GuardianUS Approves High-Power Cell Service for Musk\u2019s Starlink Despite ObjectionsWhat Happened: The FCC granted Starlink, Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service, approval to operate a high-power direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile, overriding objections from AT&T and Verizon, who warned of interference risks.Why It Matters: The decision gives Starlink a major advantage in satellite-to-phone connectivity, expanding Musk\u2019s control over the U.S. communications infrastructure. Critics warn of potential service disruptions and regulatory favoritism benefiting Musk\u2019s business empire.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Tariffs Could Help Tesla by Hurting Its Rivals MoreWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new tariffs on Chinese, Mexican, and Canadian goods are expected to hurt global automakers, but Tesla is largely insulated due to its domestic manufacturing in Texas and California. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s policies will give Elon Musk\u2019s company a major advantage by shielding Tesla while squeezing competitors reliant on foreign supply chains. Source: The New York TimesCBO: House GOP Budget Requires Medicaid Cuts to Fund Tax BreaksWhat Happened: A Congressional Budget Office analysis found that House Republicans\u2019 budget goals\u2014cutting $1.5 trillion in spending\u2014would require slashing Medicaid by at least $880 billion over a decade. The cuts would help fund Trump-backed tax breaks for the rich.Why It Matters: The plan prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy over healthcare for low-income Americans, exposing the corruption behind claims of fiscal responsibility.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Tightens Control Over FBI, DOJ in Unprecedented Power GrabWhat Happened: FBI Director Kash Patel has bypassed traditional protocol by requesting direct, secure contact with Trump from his FBI office and home. Patel\u2014 along with senior Justice Department officials\u2014 has aligned the agency\u2019s priorities with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda, sidelining independent oversight. Why It Matters: The direct White House influence over the FBI and DOJ shatters long-standing norms meant to protect law enforcement from political interference. This further reiterates Trump\u2019s intent to use federal law enforcement as a political weapon to carry out his extremist agenda against opponents.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump Fires Two Senior DOJ Officials, Including Pardon AttorneyWhat Happened: Trump fired Liz Oyer, the Justice Department's Pardon Attorney, and Bobak Talebian, head of the Office of Information Policy, as part of a broader purge of career officials. Oyer, appointed in 2022, led clemency reviews, while Talebian oversaw FOIA requests. Why It Matters: Trump is reshaping the Justice Department to enforce his agenda, sidelining career officials in favor of loyalists. Oyer\u2019s removal raises concerns about politicized pardons, while Talebian\u2019s firing will undermine government transparency.Source: The Guardian\u201cDiversity\u201d Dismissals Begin at Top US Intelligence AgencyWhat Happened: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has begun forcing officials involved in DEIA programs to resign or face termination. Why It Matters: Trump continues to weaken intelligence agencies, and his purge of intelligence employees will endanger U.S. national security.Source: ReutersTrump Stacks Kennedy Center Board with Fox News Hosts Amid BacklashWhat Happened: Trump has appointed Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, finalizing his takeover of the prestigious arts institution after naming himself chair last month. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s politicization of the Kennedy Center has sparked outrage in the arts community. Celebrities have announced boycotts, and Hamilton producers canceled upcoming shows in protest. Trump is turning a revered cultural institution into a partisan tool\u2014 a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEPA Now Requires DOGE Approval for Spending Over $50,000What Happened: The Environmental Protection Agency issued new guidance mandating that any expenditure above $50,000 must receive approval from Elon Musk. Staff must submit daily one-page justifications for funding actions, further centralizing financial control under Musk\u2019s oversight.Why It Matters: This unprecedented move hands direct financial oversight of environmental policy to an unelected billionaire, delaying critical programs and grants. It mirrors authoritarian governance, where financial bottlenecks are used to erode institutional independence and cripple regulatory agencies.Source: Associated PressFederal Prosecutors on Eric Adams Case Escorted Out After DOJ Drops ChargesWhat Happened: Two federal prosecutors involved in the corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams were placed on leave and escorted from the Southern District of New York office. The move follows the Justice Department\u2019s controversial decision to drop the case after Trump took office, using it as leverage to pressure Adams into supporting Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement. Why It Matters: The DOJ\u2019s actions were blatant political interference in prosecutions, undermining the rule of law, and they continue to purge prosecutors who refuse to break the law.Source: NBC NewsState Department Halts Air Quality Reporting at EmbassiesWhat Happened: The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality data, leaving staff and families without crucial pollution alerts. The department claims \"funding constraints\" forced the shutdown, despite minimal operating costs.Why It Matters: The move strips Americans abroad of vital health information and is politically motivated, driven by Trump\u2019s anti-climate ideology rather than budget concerns. The program previously helped expose pollution cover-ups in countries like China.Source: CBS NewsHomeland Security Ends TSA Collective Bargaining Agreement, Targeting Union ProtectionsWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security announced the termination of the collective bargaining agreement for 47,000 TSA workers, stripping them of union protections. The Trump regime claims the agreement hindered security operations, but the TSA union calls the move a retaliatory attack against organized labor.Why It Matters: This is a major step in Trump\u2019s effort to dismantle federal worker protections and crush union power. It mirrors authoritarian tactics where governments suppress labor rights to consolidate control and weaken opposition. The move also threatens TSA workforce stability and will affect national security.Source: Associated PressCDC plans study into vaccines and autism, which has been debunkedWhat Happened: The CDC is planning a large-scale study into \u201cpotential links\u201d between vaccines and autism, despite decades of scientific research debunking any connection. The move comes amid a deadly measles outbreak.Why It Matters: This study legitimizes long-debunked conspiracy theories, further eroding public trust in vaccines when measles cases are surging due to declining immunization rates. Scientists warn that even conducting such research could fuel more disinformation and discourage parents from vaccinating their children.Source: ReutersCDC Posts \u2018Conflicts of Interest\u2019 Database on Vaccine Panel, Raising ConcernsWhat Happened: The CDC published a webpage listing alleged \"conflicts of interest\" for members of its vaccine advisory panel, part of HHS Secretary RFK Jr.'s push for \"radical transparency.\" The list includes members' past clinical trial work or institutional grants from pharmaceutical companies, despite this information already being publicly available.Why It Matters: The database is meant to fuel more vaccine skepticism by falsely implying undue industry influence over vaccine recommendations. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine conspiracy theorist, is using the agency to undermine public trust in immunization programs.Source: NBC NewsTrump Order Denies Student Loan Relief to Nonprofit Workers Deemed \u2018Improper\u2019What Happened: Trump signed an executive order modifying the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit workers engaged in activities his regime deems \u201cimproper,\u201d including immigration advocacy and certain foreign aid efforts. Why It Matters: This is a blatant political attack on nonprofits that don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s agenda, potentially violating First Amendment rights. It targets workers for their employer\u2019s mission rather than public service, setting a dangerous precedent for ideological discrimination in federal programs.Source: YahooSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrans Women Transferred to Men\u2019s Prisons Despite Court Rulings Against Trump\u2019s OrderWhat Happened: Trump has forcibly transferred incarcerated trans women to men\u2019s prisons, despite multiple court rulings blocking his executive order. The Bureau of Prisons has also altered gender markers in official records. Civil rights attorneys report trans women facing sexual violence and severe mental distress.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s policy violates federal law, including the Prison Rape Elimination Act, and disregards court orders. Trump\u2019s regime continues to disregard court orders. Also, this endangers lives, stripping incarcerated trans women of basic human rights and exposing them to systemic abuse.Source: The GuardianTrump Purges 'Woke' Language from GovernmentWhat Happened: Trump has ordered federal agencies to eliminate hundreds of words related to diversity, equity, inclusion, race, gender, environmental policy, and mental health. Terms like equity, female, women, Black, Indigenous, pollution, pregnancy, and climate crisis are being scrubbed from official documents, grant proposals, and government websitesWhy It Matters: This is authoritarian censorship, suppressing essential public discourse and reinforcing discrimination at the highest levels. I would compare it to Russia, but even there, hundreds of basic words are not banned.Source: The New York TimesPentagon DEI Purge Erases War Heroes, Historic Military EventsWhat Happened: The Pentagon has flagged over 26,000 images for deletion as part of Trump\u2019s DEI purge, with estimates reaching as high as 100,000. Among the targeted content are photos of Medal of Honor recipients, the Tuskegee Airmen, the first female Marine infantry graduates, and commemorative events for Black, Hispanic, and female service members. Confusion over implementation also led to images being flagged simply because they contained the word \u201cgay,\u201d including references to the WWII Enola Gay aircraft.Why It Matters: This sweeping erasure mirrors authoritarian tactics\u2014rewriting history by eliminating contributions of minorities in the military. It goes beyond DEI programs, effectively erasing key milestones and historical events from military records to reshape propaganda in line with Trump\u2019s extremist nationalist agenda.Source: CBS NewsTrump Sends Politically Charged Survey to ResearchersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime sent a questionnaire to researchers and organizations conducting overseas projects, requiring them to disclose any ties to \u201ccommunist, socialist, or totalitarian parties\u201d and state whether their work helps combat \u201cChristian persecution.\u201d The survey was sent to federally funded groups working on disease research, surveillance, and public health programs abroad. Recipients were given only 48 hours to respond.Why It Matters: The survey injects political ideology into scientific and humanitarian work to revoke funding based on perceived political affiliations. Source: The New York TimesThrust into Unemployment, Axed Federal Workers Face Relatives Who Celebrate Their FiringWhat Happened: Thousands of federal workers laid off under Trump and Musk are facing unexpected hostility from their own families, with some relatives celebrating their firings as necessary cuts to \"government waste.\" Many laid-off federal workers, struggling to find work and replace lost benefits, are encountering hatred instead of support.Why It Matters: This is state-driven indoctrination in action\u2014mirroring Russia, where citizens absorb state propaganda, lose empathy for their family members, and even turn them in for political dissent. Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on federal workers have created a cultural shift where public servants are vilified, fostering division and a willingness to dehumanize those affected by his regime\u2019s purges.Source: Associated PressTrump Cancels $400 Million in Columbia University GrantsWhat Happened: Trump revoked $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing the school's alleged failure to address antisemitic harassment. The move follows the regime\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of Columbia\u2019s federal contracts amid tensions over campus protests.Why It Matters: This sets a dangerous precedent where the federal government can financially punish institutions for political reasons. Today, it's framed as combating antisemitism\u2014tomorrow, it will be used to silence dissent and academic freedom, furthering Trump\u2019s authoritarian agenda.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJustice Dept. Ends Louisiana Petrochemical Case, Cites \u2018Dismantling Radical DEI\u2019What Happened: Trump dropped a federal lawsuit against Denka Performance Elastomer, a Louisiana petrochemical plant accused of endangering a majority-Black community with toxic emissions. The DOJ and EPA framed the move as part of their effort to eliminate \u201cradical DEI programs\u201d and Biden-era environmental justice initiatives.Why It Matters: This is a blatant rollback of environmental protections, prioritizing corporate interests over public health, especially in marginalized communities. Trump\u2019s regime favors industrial elites while suppressing protections for the public.Source: Associated PressU.S. Citizen Detained by ICE Questions His Vote for TrumpWhat Happened: Jensy Machado, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was stopped and handcuffed by ICE agents in Virginia while driving to work. Agents were searching for someone else with a deportation order but detained Machado instead, ignoring his attempts to show ID.Why It Matters: Machado, a Trump voter, now questions his support after experiencing firsthand the regime\u2019s aggressive immigration enforcement. His case highlights increasing racial profiling and civil rights violations under Trump\u2019s policies.Source: NBC NewsTrump's Travel Ban May Include Afghanistan, Blocking U.S. AlliesWhat Happened: The State Department is reviewing visa programs as part of Trump's executive order targeting countries with \"deficient vetting.\" Afghanistan may be added to the travel ban list, potentially barring thousands of Afghans\u2014including U.S. allies\u2014from entering the country.Why It Matters: This will abandon Afghan allies who risked their lives working alongside U.S. forces. Tens of thousands are already stranded due to Trump\u2019s suspension of refugee programs and foreign aid for evacuations. Source: CNNTrump Finalizing New Travel Ban Targeting Multiple CountriesWhat Happened: Trump is preparing a new travel ban that would bar entry to the U.S. for citizens from \"red list\" countries, including Sudan, Venezuela, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Iran, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea. Pakistan and Afghanistan are also expected to be added. Countries coded as \u201corange\u201d will face limited restrictions, while \u201cyellow\u201d nations have 60 days to comply with U.S. demands before potential restrictions.Why It Matters: This is a repeat of Trump\u2019s controversial 2017 travel ban, which disproportionately targeted Muslim-majority nations. The policy will disrupt families, businesses, and diplomatic relations while increasing hostility toward U.S. travelers abroad. This is part of a broader nationalist and anti-immigrant agenda.Source: USA TodayUS Quits UN Climate Damage Fund BoardWhat Happened: The U.S. withdrew from the board of the UN's \"loss and damage\" climate fund, ending its pledged $17.5 million contribution. The move is part of Trump\u2019s retreat from international climate efforts, including re-exiting the Paris Agreement and halting U.S. scientist participation in global climate research.Why It Matters: This weakens international climate cooperation and leaves vulnerable nations with fewer resources to address climate disasters, reinforcing the regime\u2019s anti-climate stance.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDOGE Cuts Cripple U.S. Cybersecurity, Leave Grid and Infrastructure VulnerableWhat Happened: Musk fired over 130 cybersecurity experts from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, including top recruits working on the CyberSentry program\u2014critical to detecting cyber threats against the U.S. power grid, pipelines, and water systems.Why It Matters: These cuts gut America\u2019s frontline defense against cyberattacks from Russia, China, and Iran, weakening protections for critical infrastructure and leaving the U.S. more vulnerable to foreign cyber threats.Source: CBS NewsDOGE Targets Social Security Payments for FraudWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s unvetted operatives are reviewing $1.6 trillion in Social Security payments, raising concerns about wrongful denials of benefits. They are also questioning SSA\u2019s telephone service, possibly signaling privatization or cuts.Why It Matters: This unprecedented review of Social Security raises alarm bells about potential benefit cuts under the guise of fraud prevention. With Musk\u2019s operatives in control, there are fears of mismanagement and wrongful denials that could harm millions of retirees, disabled individuals, and low-income beneficiaries. Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s Planned Dismantling of the Education Department Puts Trillions in Student Loans at RiskWhat Happened: Trump is moving to dismantle the Department of Education, leaving the fate of its $1.64 trillion student loan portfolio in limbo. Plans are being discussed to shift loan management to Treasury, Commerce, or the Small Business Administration. Meanwhile, Project 2025 suggests eliminating direct federal student lending and outsourcing loans to private companies, with taxpayers acting as \"investors.\"Why It Matters: The proposed shift will result in higher costs and stricter lending terms for students, prioritizing corporate profits over affordable education. The lack of clarity has caused confusion among staff and borrowers, raising concerns about loan forgiveness, repayment options, and government oversight of student debt.Source: CNNUSDA Eliminates Two Food Safety Advisory CommitteesWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Agriculture disbanded the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods and the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection. The move was carried out under Trump\u2019s executive order.Why It Matters: These committees provided scientific oversight on food safety and public health, offering independent recommendations on regulations. Their elimination will result in no government oversight, increasing contamination and foodborne illnesses. Source: ReutersNo One Voted to Defund 1,000 Community Health CentersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Medicaid funding freeze and proposed budget cuts threaten the survival of over 1,000 community health centers that serve 32 million low-income Americans. These clinics provide essential medical, dental, and behavioral health care, especially in rural and underserved communities. Why It Matters: Defunding CHCs will force millions of uninsured and low-income patients into emergency rooms, driving up healthcare costs while eliminating critical care options. The move is part of GOP\u2019s efforts to dismantle safety net programs to provide tax cuts for the rich, disproportionately harming marginalized communities.Source: Mother JonesTrump\u2019s Foreign Aid Cuts Raise Global Pandemic RisksWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s halt on foreign aid has crippled global disease prevention programs, leaving dangerous pathogens unsecured, halting inspections for Ebola and mpox, and stopping screenings at international checkpoints. Scientists warn that outbreaks, once contained by U.S.-funded efforts, now pose a greater risk of spreading worldwide, including to the U.S.Why It Matters: Cutting disease prevention funding weakens global health security, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks reaching American soil. Experts say the move undermines efforts to control pandemics before they spread, making Americans more vulnerable.Source: The New York TimesDOGE Is Putting Major Government Efficiency Projects at RiskWhat Happened: Elon Musk has fired over 200 government technologists, gutting critical technology teams in the General Services Administration and the now-defunct United States Digital Service. The 18F division, which helped modernize digital government services, was hard hit\u201490 employees were abruptly terminated via a surprise email. These cuts have crippled vital public services, including disaster preparedness systems, passport processing, and tax filing improvements.Why It Matters: In the name of \u201cefficiency,\u201d Musk is dismantling programs that improve government efficiency, crippling services that millions of Americans rely on. Source: WIREDTrump Weakens Anti-Corruption Measures, Undermining Fight Against FentanylWhat Happened: Trump is scaling back enforcement of the Corporate Transparency Act, a 2021 law requiring companies to disclose their real owners. The Treasury Department will now only enforce the rule for foreign-based entities, despite evidence that Mexican cartels and Chinese financiers exploit U.S. shell companies for money laundering in the fentanyl trade.Why It Matters: By weakening financial transparency, Trump is undercutting his anti-fentanyl agenda, making it easier for drug traffickers to hide illicit funds. This cripples federal investigators' ability to track and dismantle transnational criminal networks and further reiterates that Trump is using cartels and fentanyl as a guise to pursue his extremist agendas.Source: NOTUS\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump's '51st State' Talk Sparks Canadian Fears of Economic AnnexationWhat Happened: In a February call, Trump told Trudeau he questioned the legitimacy of the U.S.-Canada border treaty and wanted to renegotiate shared water agreements. He has continuously referred to Canada as the \"51st state\" and suggested using \"economic force\" to bring it under U.S. control. Trump questioned the border itself, implying it should be redrawn. Why It Matters: Canadians see Trump\u2019s rhetoric as a serious threat. With tariffs on Canadian exports now in place, Trudeau accused Trump of trying to \"collapse the Canadian economy\" to make annexation easier. The escalating trade war and Trump's border comments have strained U.S.-Canada relations and raised alarm over potential territorial ambitions. Trump is mirroring Putin in his imperial ambitions.Source: The New York TimesAlarmed by Trump, Poland Must Consider Nuclear Options, Premier SaysWhat Happened: Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned that Trump\u2019s shift in U.S. geopolitics has placed Poland and Ukraine in a vulnerable position. In response, Tusk said Poland must double its military manpower and explore nuclear and other advanced weapon options. He confirmed discussions with France about extending its nuclear umbrella to Poland and other European nations.Why It Matters: With Trump casting doubt on NATO and scaling back U.S. security commitments, Poland\u2014Europe\u2019s top defense spender at 4% of GDP\u2014is looking for alternative deterrence measures. A move toward nuclear capabilities marks a major shift in European security strategy and is only the beginning, as Trump\u2019s policies will set off a nuclear arms race.Source: The New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Calls Putin \u2018Generous,\u2019 Says Ukraine Is \u2018Difficult\u2019What Happened: Trump praised Putin as \"more generous than he has to be\" in peace talks while dismissing Ukraine as \"difficult.\" He insisted, \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well with Russia,\u201d and reiterated lies that Putin wants peace. Trump relished in Ukraine\u2019s suffering under the escalating relentless Russian bombings, quipping that he doesn\u2019t blame Putin for escalating attacks, saying it was \u201cwhat anybody else would do.\u201d Meanwhile, the U.S. has cut off weapons, satellite imagery, and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, crippling its defenses. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s comments not only downplay Russian genocidal aggression but also signal tacit approval of Putin\u2019s escalated assault on Ukraine. By cutting off critical U.S. support, he is actively undermining Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself and assisting Russia. Source: ABC NewsTrump Cuts Satellite Access, Directly Aiding Putin\u2019s War in UkraineWhat Happened: Trump has suspended Ukraine's access to U.S.-purchased commercial satellite imagery through the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program. Maxar Technologies confirmed that the U.S. government ordered the suspension, which follows the regime\u2019s cutting of intelligence-sharing with Kyiv.Why It Matters: By cutting off Ukraine\u2019s access to vital satellite intelligence, Trump is actively aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, leaving Ukrainian forces blind on the battlefield and exposing civilians to greater danger as Russia escalates its attacks. With Russia deliberately targeting civilians, Trump\u2019s actions weaken Ukraine\u2019s defenses and serve as a pressure tactic to force Ukraine into surrender under the guise of \u201cnegotiations.\u201dSource: Reuters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsDOGE Job Cuts Bring Pain to Trump HeartlandWhat Happened: Hundreds of federal workers in Parkersburg, West Virginia\u2014many of whom voted for Trump\u2014were abruptly fired as part of Musk\u2019s purge. The layoffs have left once-loyal Trump supporters disillusioned, realizing the impact of his purging of government on their livelihoods.Why It Matters: The cuts are hitting deep in Republican strongholds, sparking backlash as workers who backed Trump now find themselves jobless, and it is a direct economic blow for communities that helped elect him. Source: ReutersTrump and Allies Admit Economic Pain Is Coming, Contradicting Campaign PromisesWhat Happened: Trump and his cronies warn Americans of upcoming economic disruptions due to tariffs and mass federal layoffs, contradicting his campaign pledge to lower costs \"on day one.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called it a necessary \u201cdetox period,\u201d while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick admitted prices on some goods will rise.Why It Matters: This is a complete reversal from Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, where he promised to \u201cend inflation immediately\u201d and denied tariffs would raise costs. Now, Americans face higher prices, job losses, and economic instability.Source: NBC NewsCanada Suspends Imports from Major U.S. Pork Plant Amid Trade War TensionsWhat Happened: Canada has blocked imports from Smithfield Foods\u2019 largest U.S. pork processing plant in North Carolina, citing noncompliance issues. While officials claim the move is unrelated to trade tensions, it comes amid escalating tariff disputes between Washington and Ottawa.Why It Matters: This suspension hits the U.S. farm sector hard as it faces economic fallout from Trump\u2019s trade wars. Retaliatory actions by major importers will further weaken demand for American agricultural exports, exacerbating financial strain on farmers.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s \u2018Shock and Awe\u2019 Agenda Leaves Virginia Businesses ScramblingWhat Happened: Virginia businesses, particularly in construction and manufacturing, struggle to navigate uncertainty as Trump\u2019s new tariffs threaten to increase costs. Builders report difficulty securing bids on imported materials like drywall, while banks and investors are hesitating on new projects.Why It Matters: The instability caused by Trump\u2019s yo-yo trade policies is slowing economic activity, with businesses unable to plan due to unpredictable costs. The regime\u2019s aggressive economic agenda creates a chilling effect on investment and job growth.Source: ReutersTrump Escalates Trade War with Canada Over Dairy and LumberWhat Happened: Trump threatened reciprocal tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber, claiming that Canada imposes a \u201c200 percent tariff\u201d on U.S. dairy and \u201ctremendously high\u201d tariffs on lumber. He warned Canada will face the same tariffs unless it drops its restrictions, suggesting the U.S. could impose them as early as next week.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s threats continue to intensify an already growing trade war between the U.S. and Canada and will disrupt major industries on both sides of the border.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsVeterans Nationwide March: March 14, 2025Thousands \u201cStand Up for Science\u201d Nationwide Amid Trump\u2019s Attacks on ResearchWhat Happened: Scientists, Nobel laureates, medical researchers, and concerned Americans rallied across the U.S. in the largest pro-science protest of Trump\u2019s second term. \u201cStand Up for Science\" demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C., and over 30 other locations, protesting historic cuts to federally funded research, mass firings at science agencies, and the removal of DEI initiatives from NIH, CDC, and FDA websites.Source: Mother JonesStates Sue Trump Over Mass Federal Worker FiringsWhat Happened: Maryland and 19 other states have sued Trump, alleging that the mass firings of probationary federal workers are illegal.

The General Services Administration installed Starlink within days of Musk requesting it, a process that typically takes weeks or months.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk, as a senior Trump adviser and CEO of SpaceX, is gutting U.S. agencies while profiting from contracts, creating a blatant conflict of interest. His ability to unilaterally control internet access during crises gives him outsized influence over national security and emergency response.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>HUD Considers Crypto Experiment Amid Trump\\u2019s Push for Digital Assets</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Housing and Urban Development is discussing using blockchain and stablecoins to monitor federal grants, with some officials fearing it could pave the way for broader government adoption of cryptocurrency. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This raises serious concerns about financial stability, fraud, and deregulation, particularly given Trump's ties to the crypto industry and his regime\\u2019s pro-crypto stance. Officials warn it could introduce an unregulated financial instrument into the housing market, echoing risks seen in the 2008 crisis.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hud-considers-crypto-blockchain-stablecoin-housing-urban-development\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Tether CEO Defends Cooperation with Trump </strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, the world\\u2019s most traded cryptocurrency, defended the company\\u2019s close ties to Trump\\u2019s cronies, claiming, \\u201CWe\\u2019ve never been shady.\\u201D Tether, backed by Trump aide Howard Lutnick, now holds $140 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds\\u2014making it the 17th largest holder of U.S. government debt.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Tether\\u2019s transformation from a target of regulatory scrutiny to a key government ally under Trump underscores corruption, financial secrecy, and money laundering risks. Its growing influence within the regime raises alarms over conflicts of interest and potential manipulation of U.S. monetary policy and financial regulations.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/07/tether-crypto-trump-interview\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>US Approves High-Power Cell Service for Musk\\u2019s Starlink Despite Objections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FCC granted Starlink, Elon Musk\\u2019s satellite internet service, approval to operate a high-power direct-to-cell service with T-Mobile, overriding objections from AT&amp;T and Verizon, who warned of interference risks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The decision gives Starlink a major advantage in satellite-to-phone connectivity, expanding Musk\\u2019s control over the U.S. communications infrastructure. Critics warn of potential service disruptions and regulatory favoritism benefiting Musk\\u2019s business empire.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-okays-higher-power-cellphone-service-musks-starlink-despite-objections-2025-03-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Tariffs Could Help Tesla by Hurting Its Rivals More</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s new tariffs on Chinese, Mexican, and Canadian goods are expected to hurt global automakers, but Tesla is largely insulated due to its domestic manufacturing in Texas and California. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s policies will give Elon Musk\\u2019s company a major advantage by shielding Tesla while squeezing competitors reliant on foreign supply chains. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/world/asia/trump-trade-musk-tesla.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>CBO: House GOP Budget Requires Medicaid Cuts to Fund Tax Breaks</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A Congressional Budget Office analysis found that House Republicans\\u2019 budget goals\\u2014cutting $1.5 trillion in spending\\u2014would require slashing Medicaid by at least $880 billion over a decade. The cuts would help fund Trump-backed tax breaks for the rich.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The plan prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy over healthcare for low-income Americans, exposing the corruption behind claims of fiscal responsibility.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-republicans-budget-medicaid-cbo/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Tightens Control Over FBI, DOJ in Unprecedented Power Grab</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FBI Director Kash Patel has bypassed traditional protocol by requesting direct, secure contact with Trump from his FBI office and home. Patel\\u2014 along with senior Justice Department officials\\u2014 has aligned the agency\\u2019s priorities with Trump\\u2019s extremist agenda, sidelining independent oversight. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The direct White House influence over the FBI and DOJ shatters long-standing norms meant to protect law enforcement from political interference.

Oyer, appointed in 2022, led clemency reviews, while Talebian oversaw FOIA requests. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is reshaping the Justice Department to enforce his agenda, sidelining career officials in favor of loyalists. Oyer\\u2019s removal raises concerns about politicized pardons, while Talebian\\u2019s firing will undermine government transparency.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-fires-pardon-attorney\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u201CDiversity\\u201D Dismissals Begin at Top US Intelligence Agency</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has begun forcing officials involved in DEIA programs to resign or face termination. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues to weaken intelligence agencies, and his purge of intelligence employees will endanger U.S. national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deia-terminations-begin-us-office-director-national-intelligence-lawyer-says-2025-03-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Stacks Kennedy Center Board with Fox News Hosts Amid Backlash</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has appointed Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center board, finalizing his takeover of the prestigious arts institution after naming himself chair last month. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s politicization of the Kennedy Center has sparked outrage in the arts community.

Trump is turning a revered cultural institution into a partisan tool\\u2014 a classic authoritarian tactic.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5183864-trump-laura-ingraham-maria-bartiromo-kennedy-center/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>EPA Now Requires DOGE Approval for Spending Over $50,000</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency issued new guidance mandating that any expenditure above $50,000 must receive approval from Elon Musk. Staff must submit daily one-page justifications for funding actions, further centralizing financial control under Musk\\u2019s oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unprecedented move hands direct financial oversight of environmental policy to an unelected billionaire, delaying critical programs and grants. It mirrors authoritarian governance, where financial bottlenecks are used to erode institutional independence and cripple regulatory agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-doge-epa-spending-musk-zeldin-whitehouse-3a381c3b136fb1b39dc5acd37dc6f28c\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Federal Prosecutors on Eric Adams Case Escorted Out After DOJ Drops Charges</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Two federal prosecutors involved in the corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams were placed on leave and escorted from the Southern District of New York office. The move follows the Justice Department\\u2019s controversial decision to drop the case after Trump took office, using it as leverage to pressure Adams into supporting Trump\\u2019s immigration enforcement. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The DOJ\\u2019s actions were blatant political interference in prosecutions, undermining the rule of law, and they continue to purge prosecutors who refuse to break the law.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/federal-prosecutors-worked-eric-adams-case-escorted-workplace-rcna195398\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>State Department Halts Air Quality Reporting at Embassies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies and consulates to stop publishing air quality data, leaving staff and families without crucial pollution alerts. The department claims \\\\\\\"funding constraints\\\\\\\" forced the shutdown, despite minimal operating costs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move strips Americans abroad of vital health information and is politically motivated, driven by Trump\\u2019s anti-climate ideology rather than budget concerns.

The Trump regime claims the agreement hindered security operations, but the TSA union calls the move a retaliatory attack against organized labor.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a major step in Trump\\u2019s effort to dismantle federal worker protections and crush union power. It mirrors authoritarian tactics where governments suppress labor rights to consolidate control and weaken opposition. The move also threatens TSA workforce stability and will affect national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-67a02b3f25048191920d5f9d7eae3cdf-tracker/c/67ca6f19-210c-800e-9e2a-3f4c5d547b07\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>CDC plans study into vaccines and autism, which has been debunked</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The CDC is planning a large-scale study into \\u201Cpotential links\\u201D between vaccines and autism, despite decades of scientific research debunking any connection. The move comes amid a deadly measles outbreak.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This study legitimizes long-debunked conspiracy theories, further eroding public trust in vaccines when measles cases are surging due to declining immunization rates. Scientists warn that even conducting such research could fuel more disinformation and discourage parents from vaccinating their children.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-plans-study-into-vaccines-autism-sources-say-2025-03-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>CDC Posts \\u2018Conflicts of Interest\\u2019 Database on Vaccine Panel, Raising Concerns</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The CDC published a webpage listing alleged \\\\\\\"conflicts of interest\\\\\\\" for members of its vaccine advisory panel, part of HHS Secretary RFK Jr.'s push for \\\\\\\"radical transparency.\\\\\\\" The list includes members' past clinical trial work or institutional grants from pharmaceutical companies, despite this information already being publicly available.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The database is meant to fuel more vaccine skepticism by falsely implying undue industry influence over vaccine recommendations.
