Since his reelection campaign, his net worth has doubled to $5.4 billion. From luxury products to crypto schemes to foreign real estate, Trump is openly monetizing political power.Why It Matters: This is naked corruption, with the presidency up for sale. Trump has turned his second term into a for-profit empire, merging state power with private gain. Source: The GuardianKey RFK Jr advisers stand to profit from a new federal health initiativeWhat Happened: RFK Jr. is launching a $10\u2013$20 million \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d campaign to fight ultra-processed foods. But key advisers like Calley Means\u2014who owns a company that promotes health wearables\u2014stand to profit. His sister, Casey Means, Kennedy\u2019s surgeon general nominee, runs a startup selling the very devices being promoted.Why It Matters: This is textbook self-dealing. Kennedy\u2019s campaign is pushing policies that will enrich his inner circle, with no divestments, oversight, or any ethics guardrails. Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDemocrats say they were left in dark about plans for US strikes on IranWhat Happened: Top Democrats say they were blindsided by Trump\u2019s military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, receiving no briefing before 125 aircraft and 75 Tomahawk missiles were deployed. Republicans were reportedly notified in advance, while Democrats learned from Trump\u2019s social media.Why It Matters: Trump is politicizing national security and blocking opposition from exercising constitutional oversight. By bypassing Congress to launch strikes on Iran, he\u2019s eroding democratic checks and turning war powers into a campaign tool. Even Fox News knew about the strikes before Democrats.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Attacks Watergate Laws in Massive Shift of Ethics SystemWhat Happened: Trump is systematically dismantling the post-Watergate legal framework that imposed checks on presidential power, including protections for civil servants, rules against impoundment, and the independence of inspectors general. He\u2019s firing watchdogs, gutting agencies like USAID, and asserting total control over federal employees in defiance of bipartisan reforms enacted after Nixon\u2019s abuses.Why It Matters: This marks the collapse of Watergate-era ethics. Trump is erasing the very guardrails meant to prevent presidential abuse. With some courts backing him and Congress serving as a rubber stamp, the presidency is morphing into a vehicle for personal power and political vengeance.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsA $250 bill and \u2018WMAGA\u2019: GOP lawmakers push legislation honoring TrumpWhat Happened: Republican lawmakers have introduced at least 8 bills to honor Trump while he\u2019s still in office\u2014including renaming Dulles Airport, rebranding D.C.\u2019s Metro system as \u201cWMAGA,\u201d and printing $250 bills with his face on them. The bills are unlikely to pass but serve as a loyalty signal to Trump.Why It Matters: Congress isn\u2019t acting as a coequal branch of government but performing loyalty theater. These bills don\u2019t serve the public; they serve Trump, blurring the line between governance and authoritarian idolatry, just like in Russia.Source: Washington Post\u2018Our era of violent populism\u2019: the US has entered a new phase of political violenceWhat Happened: A surge of political violence\u2014including a lawmaker\u2019s assassination, protest clashes, and armed threats\u2014signals a dangerous shift in American life. Fueled by deep polarization and democratic backsliding, targeted attacks are becoming disturbingly routine.Why It Matters: This is the normalization of political violence. Trump continues to empower it, fueling a system now spiraling beyond control. With democratic norms collapsing and institutions unprepared, America is entering a perilous new era.Source: The GuardianMAGA Influencers Fall in Line Behind Trump After U.S. Airstrikes Hit IranWhat Happened: After some hesitation, key MAGA influencers quickly endorsed Trump\u2019s airstrikes on Iran. Vocal anti-interventionists like Jack Posobiec and Charlie Kirk called the attacks justified, while Steve Bannon, despite initial criticism, ultimately backed Trump.Why It Matters: Despite fractures in the base, influencers fell in line fast, revealing how loyalty to Trump outweighs everything.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsMasked men in U.S. Border Patrol vests take Santa Ana father after repeatedly hitting himWhat Happened: In a viral video, masked men wearing U.S. Border Patrol vests violently beat and detained Narciso Barranco, a Santa Ana landscaper and father of three U.S. Marines, before forcing him into an unmarked SUV. Witnesses say he was pepper-sprayed and punched repeatedly. No agency has confirmed the men\u2019s identities, and local police say they\u2019re investigating.Why It Matters: This is what authoritarianism looks like\u2014masked men dragging people into unmarked cars with no ID, accountability, or explanation. It mirrors tactics used in dictatorships, not democracies. People in America should not be disappeared in the streets.Source: KTLAICE Detention Numbers Have Reached a Record HighWhat Happened: ICE is detaining over 56,000 immigrants\u2014the most since 2019\u2014as the Trump regime escalates mass arrests. Driven by Stephen Miller\u2019s push to meet daily quotas, agents are sweeping up non-criminal immigrants in workplaces and public areas, while reopening shuttered detention centers and expanding private prison deals.Why It Matters: With Congress sidelined and oversight nonexistent, abuse is becoming the norm, and due process has disappeared.Source: Mother JonesRepublican\u2019s Life-Threatening Pregnancy Collided With Florida\u2019s Abortion PoliticsWhat Happened: Rep. Kat Cammack revealed that during a 2024 ectopic pregnancy, Florida doctors delayed care out of fear they\u2019d violate the state\u2019s abortion ban. Though her life was at risk, she had to argue with hospital staff to receive treatment allowed under the law.Why It Matters: Even with exceptions, abortion bans create dangerous confusion. Cammack\u2019s story highlights how fear of prosecution delays care, even for pro-life lawmakers, putting lives at risk and exposing the real costs of these repressive policies.Source: Wall Street JournalThousands of Afghans face expulsion from US as Trump removes protectionsWhat Happened: Trump has removed Afghanistan from the Temporary Protected Status list, setting up mass deportations starting July 14. Many affected are U.S. allies and partners who fled Taliban rule after 2021. DHS claims Afghanistan is now \u201csafe\u201d\u2014despite Taliban violence and State Department warnings.Why It Matters: This is a betrayal with deadly consequences. Deporting allies who helped us during the war back to Afghanistan is a moral disgrace and underscores the cruelty at the core of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Afghans will be executed or jailed for helping the U.S.Source: The GuardianDenied, Detained, Deported: Trump\u2019s Immigration Crackdown Targets Students, Scientists, and U.S. CitizensWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet is targeting more than undocumented migrants. Visa holders, asylum seekers, and green-card holders are being detained under vague \u201cnational security\u201d claims. Some have been disappeared without hearings, while Americans aiding migrants are being surveilled or harassed.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing immigration law to silence critics, crush activism, and bypass due process. Today, it\u2019s students and scholars\u2014tomorrow it\u2019s anyone who speaks out.Source: The GuardianNew Texas law requires 10 Commandments to be posted in every public school classroomWhat Happened: Governor Greg Abbott signed a law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every Texas public school classroom. It\u2019s part of a broader Republican effort to inject religion into public education, echoing similar measures in other states already facing legal challenges.Why It Matters: This defies long-standing church-state separation precedent. Mandating a specific religious text turns public schools into platforms for government-endorsed religion, violating constitutional protections. A similar law in Oklahoma was recently blocked by the courts.Source: PoliticoThe People Being Disappeared by ICE in Los AngelesWhat Happened: ICE agents have intensified raids across Los Angeles, detaining undocumented immigrants in secretive operations that leave families searching for answers. One such case is Francisco Urizar, a tortilla delivery worker who vanished during a June 17 raid. His daughter only learned of his detention through a viral video after ICE refused to confirm his whereabouts.Why It Matters: This is state-sponsored kidnapping. Under Trump, ICE is operating with zero transparency, denying due process, and disappearing people from their communities. These are classic tactics seen in Russia.Source: The New Yorker\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchUS Issues \u2018Worldwide Caution\u2019 for Americans After Attack on IranWhat Happened: The U.S. State Department issued a rare \u201cWorldwide Caution\u201d advisory following its strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. Americans abroad are warned to expect potential travel disruptions, anti-U.S. protests, and heightened risks in conflict zones, especially in the Middle East.Why It Matters: A day after the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, the government finally issued an alert amid airspace closures, suspended flights, and Tehran\u2019s vow to respond \u201cat a time and scale of its choosing.\u201d The delay underscores how slowly it took Trump officials to warn the public.Source: BloombergSocial Security Stops Reporting Call Wait Times and Other MetricsWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration has quietly removed key performance metrics from its website, including live call wait times and benefit processing speeds, after Musk purged staff and degraded services. The agency is now pushing a \u201cdigital-first\u201d model, even though millions of elderly and disabled Americans rely on phone and in-person help that has grown harder to access.Why It Matters: By deleting real-time service data, Trump is concealing the chaos he caused with mass purges and budget cuts. Seniors are waiting weeks for help\u2014now the public can\u2019t even see how bad the system has gotten. Source: Washington PostGOP Food Stamp Cuts Blocked by Senate RulesWhat Happened: The Senate parliamentarian ruled that Republicans\u2019 plan to shift food stamp costs to states violates Senate rules, derailing a major savings strategy in Trump\u2019s $4.5 trillion tax-and-cuts bill. The proposal would have cut aid to millions and saved an estimated $128 billion.Why It Matters: The plan would have gutted food aid for millions to help fund massive tax cuts. It\u2019s a rare procedural win for the vulnerable in a bill built to reward the rich.Source: Associated PressWhy tariffs are already driving some healthcare premiums higherWhat Happened: Health insurers are raising 2026 premiums in anticipation of Trump\u2019s proposed pharmaceutical tariffs. One insurer, IHBC, filed for a 38.4% increase, 3% of which is directly attributed to expected drug tariff impacts. Hospitals warn tariffs on imported medical supplies will drive up costs, worsen shortages, and jeopardize patient care.Why It Matters: Tariffs are beginning to inflate healthcare costs. Trump\u2019s trade policies threaten to make medical care more expensive and less accessible, especially as ACA subsidies face expiration.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTerrorism advisory bulletin warns of \"heightened threat environment\" in U.S. after strikes on IranWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security issued a terrorism advisory warning of a \u201cheightened threat environment\u201d in the U.S. after Trump\u2019s strikes on Iran. The bulletin cites risks of Iranian-backed cyberattacks, hate crimes, and retaliatory violence. While no specific threats were identified, authorities are ramping up security nationwide.Why It Matters: With Trump gutting counterterrorism and cyber efforts and purging national security experts, the burden of defense now falls to under-resourced local officials.Source: CBS NewsOfficials Concede They Don\u2019t Know the Fate of Iran\u2019s Uranium StockpileWhat Happened: A day after Trump claimed Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cobliterated,\u201d top U.S. officials, including JD Vance and IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, said Iran likely moved up to 880 pounds of 60% enriched uranium before the strike. Intelligence indicates key material and equipment may have been relocated from Fordow and Isfahan in advance, despite the bombings.Why It Matters: The missing uranium could be hidden, used as leverage, or weaponized. Expect Trump to order intelligence agencies to bury doubts and sell a false win.Source: New York TimesTrump floats Iran \u2018regime change\u2019 even as the true impact of US strikes is far from clearWhat Happened: After ordering U.S. strikes on Iran, Trump hinted at regime change\u2014even as officials admit they don\u2019t know if Iran\u2019s nuclear materials were actually destroyed. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s post calling for regime change mirrors Israel\u2019s goal of toppling the Iranian government. With no clear plan and nuclear materials possibly still intact, the U.S. would be dragged into another endless war.Source: CNNRussia\u2019s Medvedev Claims Nations Ready to Arm Iran With Nuclear Warheads After U.S. StrikesWhat Happened: Russian Security Council Deputy Chair Dmitry Medvedev claimed multiple countries are prepared to supply Iran with nuclear warheads following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. He said the attacks on Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan backfired, strengthened Iran\u2019s regime, and accelerated its nuclear ambitions.Why It Matters: Medvedev\u2019s threat reiterates Russia\u2019s deep ties to Iran, including its role in Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Yet Trump keeps showing loyalty to Putin\u2014even as Russia backs America's enemies.Source: Jerusalem PostTrump announces air strikes on three nuclear sites in IranWhat Happened: Trump announced U.S. airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites\u2014Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014via a Truth Social post. He called the mission a \u201csuccess,\u201d said all U.S. planes exited safely, and ended with, \u201cNOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump launched a major military strike without congressional approval and announced it on his social media platform. Insanity.Source: CNNSheltering in a Bunker, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Picks Successors Amid Escalating WarWhat Happened: As Israeli strikes devastate Tehran, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has gone underground, suspending electronic communication and appointing emergency successors, including three clerics to replace him if killed. Source: New York TimesEarly assessments raise questions over whether US destroyed bulk of enriched Iranian nuclear materialWhat Happened: Trump claimed Iran\u2019s nuclear sites were \u201cobliterated,\u201d but the key facility at Isfahan\u2014housing nearly 60% of enriched uranium\u2014was not hit with bunker-buster bombs. Experts say only aboveground structures were damaged, raising doubts about whether Iran\u2019s nuclear threat has truly been neutralized.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchNATO cancels Ukraine meeting at Hague summitWhat Happened: NATO leaders are preparing to pledge a dramatic defense spending boost\u2014up to 5% of GDP\u2014to hand Trump a symbolic win. But the summit has been gutted: Ukraine is off the agenda, Zelenskyy was only invited to a dinner, and a Ukraine council meeting was canceled, despite Russia\u2019s ongoing genocidal war.Why It Matters: This summit is built to appease Trump, not confront real threats. By sidelining Ukraine, NATO signals that stroking Trump\u2019s ego now matters more than standing against Putin\u2019s aggression. Ukraine\u2019s survival is being treated as secondary.Source: RBC Ukraine and PoliticoPutin Claims \u201cAll of Ukraine Is Ours\u201d as Russia Eyes New OffensiveWhat Happened: Putin declared at a forum in St. Petersburg that \u201cthe whole of Ukraine is ours,\u201d signaled plans to seize more territory like Sumy, and dismissed Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty by calling Russians and Ukrainians \u201cone people.\u201d Why It Matters: Putin\u2019s words reiterate Russia\u2019s true goals of imperial conquest and the erasure of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump is blocking U.S. aid and helping shield Russia\u2019s genocidal war from consequences.Source: ReutersPutin: \u201cWherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that\u2019s ours\u201dWhat Happened: Putin declared that \u201cRussians and Ukrainians are one people,\u201d adding, \u201cWherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that\u2019s ours.\u201d He said Russia may seize Sumy to build a \u201csecurity zone\u201d along the border. While claiming there are no current plans to take Sumy, he added, \u201cI do not rule it out.\u201dWhy It Matters: Putin reaffirmed that this war was never about NATO or security\u2014it\u2019s about conquest and erasing Ukraine. His words reiterate Russia\u2019s goal, which is the total subjugation of Ukraine and the elimination of its sovereignty.Source: Meduza\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsRepublicans express concern about lack of Trump trade dealsWhat Happened: With just weeks before a July 8 tariff deadline, Republicans are growing alarmed over Trump\u2019s failure to secure new trade deals. Only China and the UK have reached \u201cagreements\u201d so far. GOP lawmakers say Trump appears overwhelmed and disorganized, with no clear point person on trade, raising concerns about economic uncertainty, stalled investments, and redirected business abroad.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff strategy is even being questioned by Republicans. Confusion inside the White House and a lack of deals will rattle markets and stall growth.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.The Presidency Is a Business \u2014 Trump continues monetizing the Oval Office with gold phones, real estate deals, and crypto scams\u2014all while he regulates those very industries.Authoritarian Tactics Are Going Mainstream \u2014 From ICE disappearances to gag orders on agencies, Trump is normalizing tactics seen in dictatorships. Congress Is a Loyalty Parade \u2014 Republicans aren\u2019t legislating\u2014they\u2019re performing for power. Bills to print Trump\u2019s face on money and rename airports show how far the cult has gone.Ukraine Is Being Abandoned for Trump\u2019s Ego \u2014 NATO\u2019s sidelining of Ukraine during the upcoming summit to placate Trump sends a dangerous signal to Putin and demoralizes those fighting for democracy.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

You have to call the local SS office because the kind folks at the nat'l are appalled at how long this has taken. I was just yesterday told that I had been reinstated in February &amp; asked if I had received my card. #1 Throwing a new card in the mail isn't going to do it...no notification (I find out by calling [again, it's taking days to contact them]?!!!? 5 fucking months later? No explanation? I don't think \"cause I got a new card\" is going to pay the creditors on my doorstep.) They \"reinstated\" me to the wrong insurance coverage. Aaaaaaaaaa!!!!!

Since his reelection campaign, his net worth has doubled to $5.4 billion. From luxury products to crypto schemes to foreign real estate, Trump is openly monetizing political power.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is naked corruption, with the presidency up for sale. Trump has turned his second term into a for-profit empire, merging state power with private gain. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/trump-products-presidency-as-a-brand\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Key RFK Jr advisers stand to profit from a new federal health initiative</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> RFK Jr. is launching a $10\\u2013$20 million \\u201CMake America Healthy Again\\u201D campaign to fight ultra-processed foods. But key advisers like Calley Means\\u2014who owns a company that promotes health wearables\\u2014stand to profit. His sister, Casey Means, Kennedy\\u2019s surgeon general nominee, runs a startup selling the very devices being promoted.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is textbook self-dealing. Kennedy\\u2019s campaign is pushing policies that will enrich his inner circle, with no divestments, oversight, or any ethics guardrails. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/rfk-maha-ultra-processed-foods\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Democrats say they were left in dark about plans for US strikes on Iran</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Top Democrats say they were blindsided by Trump\\u2019s military strike on Iran\\u2019s nuclear sites, receiving no briefing before 125 aircraft and 75 Tomahawk missiles were deployed. Republicans were reportedly notified in advance, while Democrats learned from Trump\\u2019s social media.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is politicizing national security and blocking opposition from exercising constitutional oversight. By bypassing Congress to launch strikes on Iran, he\\u2019s eroding democratic checks and turning war powers into a campaign tool. Even Fox News knew about the strikes before Democrats.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/22/democrats-iran-airstrikes\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Attacks Watergate Laws in Massive Shift of Ethics System</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is systematically dismantling the post-Watergate legal framework that imposed checks on presidential power, including protections for civil servants, rules against impoundment, and the independence of inspectors general. He\\u2019s firing watchdogs, gutting agencies like USAID, and asserting total control over federal employees in defiance of bipartisan reforms enacted after Nixon\\u2019s abuses.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks the collapse of Watergate-era ethics. Trump is erasing the very guardrails meant to prevent presidential abuse. With some courts backing him and Congress serving as a rubber stamp, the presidency is morphing into a vehicle for personal power and political vengeance.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/21/trump-watergate-presidency-congress/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>A $250 bill and \\u2018WMAGA\\u2019: GOP lawmakers push legislation honoring Trump</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Republican lawmakers have introduced at least 8 bills to honor Trump while he\\u2019s still in office\\u2014including renaming Dulles Airport, rebranding D.C.\\u2019s Metro system as \\u201CWMAGA,\\u201D and printing $250 bills with his face on them.
