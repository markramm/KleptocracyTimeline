This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct6eN0zD4V-eFBAJgR2zCiIIo4ycjZysrCYixcdDpNfm1c1Q/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsLandlord Seeks to Evict GOP Rep. Cory Mills Over $85K in Unpaid RentWhat Happened: Florida Republican Rep. Cory Mills is being sued by his D.C. landlord for failing to pay over $85,000 in rent on a luxury apartment. Mills blames a payment processing glitch, but records show repeated late payments and prior legal threats. Why It Matters: Mills sits on powerful House committees and claims to fight for fiscal responsibility\u2014yet he\u2019s facing eviction while under ethics investigation for shady finances. It\u2019s another MAGA hypocrisy exposed.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s CFPB Drops Major Cases Protecting Big Banks and CorporationsWhat Happened: Under Trump, the CFPB dropped lawsuits against Capital One, Walmart, Zelle, and Navy Federal, erasing billions in refunds and penalties owed to consumers. Overdraft fee caps were also repealed.Why It Matters: The agency meant to protect consumers is now shielding corporations\u2014leaving everyday Americans exposed to fraud and abuse.Source: Associated PressUS delays rule on Gulf of Mexico whale protections by two yearsWhat Happened: Trump delayed protections for the critically endangered Rice\u2019s whale\u2014of which fewer than 100 remain\u2014by two years. The move halts a proposed rule to limit oil and gas drilling in parts of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from fossil fuel interests, and reverses Biden-era efforts to expand the whale\u2019s protected habitat.Why It Matters: Trump is siding with oil lobbyists. Delaying protections risks driving a critically endangered whale to extinction\u2014just to keep drilling unrestricted.Source: ReutersUS SEC ends Cognizant bribery case that the Justice Department also abandonedWhat Happened: The SEC dropped its civil bribery case against two former Cognizant execs after Trump froze enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The DOJ also dropped related criminal charges over a $2 million bribe to an Indian official. Trump called the FCPA a \u201chorrible law\u201d and claimed ending it would help U.S. businesses compete overseas.Why It Matters: This is open season for corporate corruption. Trump has gutted America\u2019s anti-bribery law, signaling that foreign bribery is now fair game if it helps U.S. companies profit.Source: ReutersUS SEC ousts head of accounting watchdogWhat Happened: SEC Chairman Paul Atkins forced out Erica Williams, head of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, effective July 22. Williams, a Democrat appointed in 2022, led aggressive reforms and imposed record penalties on corporate auditors. Her removal follows the GOP takeover of the SEC under Trump.Why It Matters: This is another purge of a tough regulator. Trump\u2019s SEC is dismantling financial oversight, weakening protections, as corporate accountability needs to be strengthened.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump wants 5-seat pickup from redraw of Texas congressional mapWhat Happened: Trump is pushing Texas Republicans to redraw congressional maps to add five new GOP-friendly seats, aiming to secure House control in 2026. The move comes ahead of a special legislative session and could spark similar efforts in other GOP-led states. \u201cThere could be some other states we\u2019re going to get another three, or four or five in addition. Texas would be the biggest one.\u201d Trump said. \u201cJust a simple redrawing we pick up five seats.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is another direct attack on fair elections. Trump is using gerrymandering to try and rig the system in his favor\u2014redrawing districts to lock in GOP dominance and suppress opposition. It\u2019s a power grab designed to bypass voters and entrench minority rule between election cycles.Source: PoliticoTrump reshaped the Supreme Court. Now emergency appeals are helping him reshape the governmentWhat Happened: Trump has turned the Supreme Court\u2019s emergency docket into a political weapon, fast-tracking radical policies\u2014like purging federal workers, stripping protections from immigrants, and gutting agencies like the Education Department\u2014without full legal review. With a court he reshaped, Trump is bypassing lower courts, getting green lights with no explanations, and enacting sweeping changes while final rulings remain pending.Why It Matters: This is judicial capture in action. Trump is rewriting the government by exploiting a shadow legal process, and the Supreme Court is letting him do it\u2014with no transparency, accountability, and no way to undo the damaging actions.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsThe FBI's Jeffrey Epstein Prison Video Had Nearly 3 Minutes Cut OutWhat Happened: Metadata from the DOJ\u2019s so-called \u201craw\u201d Epstein prison video reveals nearly 3 minutes were removed just before the infamous \u201cmissing minute.\u201d The FBI edited the footage using Adobe Premiere, stitched together two clips, and cut nearly 2:53 from one\u2014undermining claims the video was unaltered.Why It Matters: This raises serious questions about transparency and possible evidence tampering in Epstein\u2019s death. The government\u2019s timeline doesn\u2019t add up\u2014and DOJ is now accused of covering up key footage, fueling new suspicion from both allies and critics.Source: WIREDImmigration agents demand tenant information from landlords, stirring questions and confusionWhat Happened: DHS is issuing subpoenas without a judge\u2019s signature, pressuring landlords to hand over tenant files\u2014leases, IDs, rental applications, even details on roommates. Legal experts say the subpoenas may not be enforceable and are being used to intimidate landlords into aiding mass deportations.Why It Matters: This is another step toward turning private citizens into tools of state surveillance. Landlords are being coerced into spying on tenants\u2014without warrants\u2014as part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to sidestep legal protections and expand his deportation dragnet.Source: Associated PressDismissals at Justice Dept. Would Bypass Civil Service and Whistle-Blower LawsWhat Happened: Trump officials purged over 20 career Justice Department staff\u2014including ethics lawyers and ex-Jack Smith prosecutors\u2014without cause or proper process. Whistleblowers say they were targeted for resisting Trump\u2019s revenge agenda.Why It Matters: Trump continues replacing independent DOJ officials with subservients, eroding legal safeguards, and turning justice into a political weapon.Source: New York TimesUS opens probe into University of Michigan's foreign fundingWhat Happened: The Department of Education is investigating the University of Michigan over $86 million in alleged undisclosed foreign funding, citing national security concerns tied to a lab used by Chinese nationals\u2014claims some experts dispute.Why It Matters: This continues Trump\u2019s crackdown on elite universities, using national security as a pretext to target campuses. It mirrors past politically driven probes and raises alarms about federal overreach and academic freedom.Source: ReutersTrump's Controversial Pick for Pentagon Personnel Chief Confirmed by SenateWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed extremist and retired Gen. Anthony Tata as Pentagon personnel chief in a 52\u201346 party-line vote. Known for past Islamophobic remarks and conspiracy theories, Tata will now oversee 3 million Defense Department employees.Why It Matters: Tata\u2019s appointment marks another step in politicizing the military. He backs purging Biden-era officers and using troops domestically\u2014advancing Trump\u2019s goal of turning the Pentagon into a loyalist force.Source: Military.comU.S. senator wants DOGE out of sensitive payment system for farmersWhat Happened: Sen. Tammy Baldwin is urging the USDA to revoke unauthorized DOGE\u2019s access to a sensitive database controlling billions in farm payments and loans. An unvetted DOGE operative with no agricultural background was given unprecedented access to edit or cancel payments, raising alarm among lawmakers and farmers alike.Why It Matters: Unauthorized DOGE\u2019s control over farm data and relief systems threatens food security and farmers\u2019 trust. Trump\u2019s operatives are weaponizing access without oversight\u2014delaying aid, risking manipulation, and turning vital infrastructure into a political tool while building a surveillance state.Source: NPRSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump sues to oust Corporation for Public Broadcasting board membersWhat Happened: Trump filed a lawsuit to remove 3 CPB board members appointed by Biden, claiming they refused to step down after he fired them. This move escalates his broader push to defund and dismantle public media like PBS and NPR.Why It Matters: Trump is trying to seize control of public media by force\u2014purging independent board members to silence dissenting voices and reshape U.S. broadcasting into a partisan echo chamber.Source: ReutersTrump says Democratic rival Schiff should be 'brought to justice' for alleged fraudWhat Happened: Trump called for Sen. Adam Schiff to be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d over alleged mortgage \u201cfraud,\u201d despite no charges being filed. Schiff denies wrongdoing, calling it political payback for leading Trump\u2019s first impeachment.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian playbook 101\u2014Trump is weaponizing federal power to punish enemies and intimidate dissent, echoing tactics used by Putin in Russia.Source: ReutersFor Trump, Domestic Adversaries Are Not Just Wrong, They Are \u2018Evil\u2019What Happened: Trump is escalating attacks on critics, calling Democrats and journalists \u201cevil\u201d and suggesting prosecutions, imprisonment, and even stripping citizenship. He pushed for jailing a former Biden official and floated deporting Rosie O\u2019Donnell for criticism. Military officials, echoing his line, skipped a major security forum to avoid \u201cglobalists.\u201dWhy It Matters: Labeling dissent as \u201cevil\u201d lays the groundwork for authoritarian crackdowns. Trump is reframing opposition as a threat to be eliminated\u2014not debated\u2014mirroring the tactics of autocrats who criminalize criticism.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS launches new bid to keep migrants detained by denying hearings, memo showsWhat Happened: A leaked ICE memo shows Trump officials plan to block bond hearings for migrants, paving the way for indefinite detention. Backed by new funding to jail 100,000 people, the move would overturn decades of legal precedent.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting due process to expand mass detention. Stripping migrants of hearings is a dangerous step\u2014criminalizing presence and flooding detention centers without judicial review.Source: ReutersTrump Resumes Third-Country Deportation FlightsWhat Happened: Trump officials deported five migrants from Vietnam, Yemen, Laos, Jamaica, and Cuba to Eswatini, resuming third-country deportation flights after a Supreme Court greenlight. Why It Matters: The Supreme Court greenlit a policy of forcibly relocating migrants to countries they have no connection to\u2014circumventing asylum rights and exposing them to danger. It\u2019s state-sanctioned cruelty.Source: New York TimesIrish Tourist Jailed by ICE for Three-Day Overstay: \u2018Nobody Is Safe\u2019What Happened: Thomas, a 35-year-old tourist from Ireland, was jailed for nearly 100 days after overstaying his U.S. visa by just three days due to a medical emergency. Though he agreed to deportation, Trump\u2019s policies kept him locked up in ICE and federal prison under brutal conditions.Why It Matters: This shows the inhumanity of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Even minor visa issues by legal visitors now lead to mass detention\u2014proof that under Trump, no one is safe from the regime\u2019s cruelty and another reminder that it is not safe to travel to the U.S.Source: The GuardianThe Disorienting Saga of a Dallas Woman Detained By ICE on Her HoneymoonWhat Happened: Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless wedding photographer, was detained by ICE after her honeymoon\u2014despite living legally under supervision for 14 years. She endured five months in harsh detention before being released due to a grassroots campaign.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine is sweeping up longtime residents with no criminal record, ignoring due process, and targeting the most vulnerable. Stateless individuals like Ward are caught in a system with no accountability and no clear path to justice.Source: TIME\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchUS farm agency ends program to support small businessesWhat Happened: The USDA is shutting down the Regional Food Business Centers program, which aided over 5,500 small farms and food businesses. Trump\u2019s Agriculture Secretary called it unsustainable, with closures beginning immediately.Why It Matters: It\u2019s a direct hit to small farmers. While claiming to back \u201creal America,\u201d Trump continues gutting vital rural support, leaving independent producers more vulnerable than ever.Source: ReutersEmployees at the nation\u2019s consumer financial watchdog say it\u2019s become toothless under TrumpWhat Happened: CFPB staff say the agency has been paralyzed for six months. Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, run by Musk and Russell Vought, embedded operatives, reversed enforcement, and tried to purge 90% of staff\u2014only stopped by the courts.Why It Matters: The consumer watchdog is dead.

The NSC, once central to U.S. national security policy, has been gutted, sidelined by the Pentagon and State Department, and hollowed out following internal chaos and mass firings.Why It Matters: Trump has gutted the nation\u2019s top security body, swapping expertise for loyalty tests and fringe paranoia pushed by Laura Loomer. This cripples interagency coordination and leaves the U.S. dangerously exposed to domestic and foreign threats.Source: ReutersH.H.S. Finalizes Thousands of Layoffs After Supreme Court DecisionWhat Happened: HHS purged thousands of employees after a Supreme Court ruling let Trump bypass civil service protections. The cuts, led by RFK Jr., hit key agencies like the CDC, FDA, and NIH\u2014targeting public health workers, contract staff, and oversight officials.Why It Matters: We are watching the dismantling of America\u2019s health infrastructure. Trump and Kennedy are gutting essential agencies, silencing experts, and leaving Americans exposed to future crises.Source: New York TimesWhat\u2019s Next for Trump\u2019s Plans to Dismantle the Education DepartmentWhat Happened: Following a Supreme Court ruling allowing mass federal purges, Trump began gutting the Education Department\u2014firing over 1,300 staff and shifting key programs to other agencies. Why It Matters: Protections for low-income, disabled, and marginalized students are being stripped under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201dSource: New York TimesTrump yanks $15m in research into Pfas on US farms: \u2018not just stupid, it\u2019s evil\u2019What Happened: Trump officials abruptly ended $15 million in EPA-funded studies into PFAS contamination on U.S. farmland, halting research on how toxic sludge and pesticides move into crops, livestock, and water. The decision follows mounting evidence from Maine, where dozens of farms were shut down due to PFAS-laced fertilizer.Why It Matters: Canceling research on cancer-linked \u201cforever chemicals\u201d protects polluters while exposing millions to tainted food and water. Scientists warn the move will leave farmers, consumers, and regulators flying blind as PFAS quietly infiltrates the food chain.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Initiates Trade Investigation of BrazilWhat Happened: Trump officials launched a formal trade investigation into Brazil, citing unfair tariffs, restrictions on U.S. tech firms, and \u201canti-corruption interference.\u201d Trump is also imposing a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, citing Brazil\u2019s prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, his far-right insurrectionist ally, as a key reason.Why It Matters: Trump is abusing tariff powers to shield authoritarian criminals like Bolsonaro, while escalating a major international dispute that will hurt U.S. farmers and tech companies.Source: New York TimesHow North Korea Is Giving Russia an Edge in the War on UkraineWhat Happened: North Korea has become a key weapons supplier for Russia, sending tens of thousands of artillery shells, rockets, and possibly 15,000 troops to aid Putin\u2019s genocidal war on Ukraine. In return, NK is receiving food, fuel, advanced tech, and an estimated $20 billion in cash and goods.Why It Matters: North Korea is propping up Putin\u2019s genocidal invasion while testing its military against Western arms. Russia\u2019s war is now fueling Kim\u2019s regime, empowering two of the world\u2019s most brutal authoritarian states.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia Attacks Ukraine\u2019s Central Regions as US Envoy in KyivWhat Happened: Russia unleashed another massive drone and missile assault on central Ukraine, hitting cities like Kryvyi Rih and Vinnytsia. The attack came as Trump\u2019s envoy visited and pledged new weapons\u2014only if NATO pays and Putin relents within 50 days.Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s genocidal terror campaign is escalating, as Trump continues to stall. Ukrainians are under relentless assault, and Ukraine\u2019s defenses are stretched. Empty ultimatums won't stop Putin\u2014only sustained support and weapons will.Source: BloombergState Dept. Layoffs Hit Russia and Ukraine AnalystsWhat Happened: The State Department purged over 1,300 staffers, including Russia and Ukraine analysts and the war crimes unit tracking Russian atrocities. Intelligence offices were merged under INR in a major shake-up ordered by Marco Rubio.Why It Matters: This purge guts U.S. expertise on Ukraine and Russia at a critical moment. As Trump pushes a pro-Kremlin ceasefire, the cuts look like a political move to weaken intelligence and silence those tracking Putin\u2019s war crimes and genocide.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s New Strategy on Epstein Fallout: Blame the DemocratsWhat Happened: Facing backlash from his base over the refusal to release Epstein files, Trump lashed out at former supporters and claimed the outrage was a \u201cscam\u201d by Democrats. His base rejected the deflection and demanded full transparency.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s shifting Epstein narrative is backfiring, stirring anger inside his MAGA base. His efforts to reframe the scandal as a left-wing hoax expose cracks in his base\u2014and a desperate push to dodge accountability.Source: New York TimesRepublicans Block Democratic Bid to Release Epstein FilesWhat Happened: House Republicans blocked a Democratic amendment to force the release of the full Epstein evidence trove, including videos, hard drives, and client lists. Trump\u2019s DOJ reviewed the material and chose to keep it sealed, sparking MAGA infighting and backlash from conspiracy theorists.Why It Matters: Blocking the release of the Epstein files fuels public distrust and signals elite protection. As Trump allies clash and Maxwell offers to testify, the case has become a proxy war over power, secrecy, and who gets held accountable.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsInflation Hits 2.7% as Tariffs Begin to Raise Consumer PricesWhat Happened: Inflation rose to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% in May, driven by tariffs that raised prices on goods like furniture and clothing. Core inflation hit 2.9% as companies passed import costs to consumers. While car prices dipped, overall goods inflation climbed amid supply chain pressures.Why It Matters: While the full impact is still unfolding, the June data confirms tariffs are feeding inflation and straining household budgets. With economic growth uncertain, the Fed now faces a delicate balance between curbing inflation and avoiding recession.Source: Wall Street JournalPower prices are expected to soar under new tax cut and spending lawWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax-and-spending law slashes federal incentives for wind and solar, sparking turmoil in the renewables sector and prompting a shift back to costlier gas plants. The policy is expected to raise electricity bills sharply\u2014by 60% to 350% in some GOP-led states, according to Energy Innovation.Why It Matters: The move cripples clean energy development just as power demand surges from data centers and manufacturing. Trump calls renewables a \u201cblight,\u201d but experts warn his chaotic energy policy will hit consumers hard, stall climate progress, and boost dependence on fossil fuels.Source: NPRTrump Effect Starts to Show Up in EconomyWhat Happened: New data show Trump\u2019s economic policies are hitting home. Tariffs are driving up prices on goods like clothing and furniture, while immigration crackdowns are shrinking the labor force and slowing job growth in key industries.Why It Matters: Inflation is creeping back up, especially for core goods, and the average household could take a $2,800 annual hit. Copper, steel, and aluminum costs are surging, hurting construction and manufacturing.

With a court he reshaped, Trump is bypassing lower courts, getting green lights with no explanations, and enacting sweeping changes while final rulings remain pending.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is judicial capture in action.
