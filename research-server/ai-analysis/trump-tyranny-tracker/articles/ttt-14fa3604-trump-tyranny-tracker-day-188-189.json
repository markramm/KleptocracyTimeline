This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump is seeking to reshape higher education. Meet the man he wants leading the chargeWhat Happened: Trump has nominated Nicholas Kent, a former for-profit college executive and lobbyist, to serve as Under Secretary of Education. Kent, whose former employer settled for $13 million over student aid fraud, has long opposed regulations on for-profit colleges, and his nomination advanced without a public Senate hearing.Why It Matters: This hands federal student aid and college oversight to someone tied to an industry notorious for defrauding students. It\u2019s a deliberate shift away from supporting public and traditional higher education toward channeling billions into for-profit institutions.Source: USA TodayHis Former Company Got Caught Employing Undocumented Workers. Now He\u2019s Profiting Off an Immigrant Detention Camp.What Happened: The Pentagon awarded the contract for Trump\u2019s new 5,000-bed migrant detention facility at Fort Bliss to a team including Disaster Management Group, led by GOP megadonor Nathan Albers. Albers previously co-owned TentLogix, which pleaded guilty in 2019 to illegally hiring undocumented workers, yet now stands to profit from mass deportations.Why It Matters: This showcases the Trump economy of cruelty\u2014where political allies with shady records cash in on migrant abuses. It underscores the hypocrisy of an anti-immigrant agenda that turns detention into a billion-dollar business for insiders.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTop State Dept. official who once attended conference with White nationalists picked to lead US Institute of PeaceWhat Happened: Darren Beattie, a former State Department official fired for attending a white nationalist conference, has been appointed acting president of the U.S. Institute of Peace. Beattie, who founded the far-right outlet Revolver News that spread January 6 conspiracy theories, takes over after Trump\u2019s mass firings at the agency.Why It Matters: Trump has turned America\u2019s conflict-resolution institute into a platform for extremist propaganda. Installing a figure with white nationalist ties to lead USIP undermines diplomacy and damages U.S. credibility.Source: CNNTrump Gets Ready to Seize Congress\u2019 Power of the PurseWhat Happened: The White House is preparing a second rescissions package aimed at cutting Department of Education funding and may attempt a legally dubious \u201cpocket rescissions\u201d tactic. The maneuver would let OMB Director Russell Vought withhold funds late in the fiscal year and claim they\u2019ve expired\u2014bypassing Congress\u2019s approval.Why It Matters: This is another direct attack on Congress\u2019s constitutional power of the purse. By making himself \u201cImpoundment King,\u201d Trump seeks to override bipartisan spending laws and concentrate budgetary control in the White House.Source: Talking Points Memo\u2018They\u2019re consolidating power\u2019: Navy secretary\u2019s staff try to undercut incoming deputyWhat Happened: Navy Secretary John Phelan and his chief of staff are reportedly sidelining Trump\u2019s undersecretary nominee Hung Cao ahead of confirmation by removing his aides, rerouting communications, and consolidating decision-making in the secretary\u2019s office. Critical areas like shipbuilding and R&D are now being run by acting political appointees instead of seasoned civil servants.Why It Matters: This internal power grab exposes more chaos and distrust within the Pentagon as loyalists clash over a $43 billion naval expansion. Civilian oversight is being gutted, with experienced leadership replaced by unaccountable ideologues.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDepartment of Justice wants to inspect swing state voter rollsWhat Happened: The Justice Department is pushing swing states, including Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, to purge voter rolls under Trump\u2019s March executive order. DOJ is demanding data on inactive, deceased, and noncitizen voters while supporting lawsuits from right-wing groups like Judicial Watch to enforce removals.Why It Matters: This is the preparation of voter suppression masked as \u201celection integrity.\u201d By targeting Democratic-leaning states and harvesting detailed voter data, the DOJ is setting up to challenge or overturn 2026 election outcomes unfavorable to his regime.Source: USA TodayAnother whistleblower claims that top DOJ official suggested department could ignore court ordersWhat Happened: A second whistleblower alleged that Emil Bove, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and nominee for a lifetime appellate judgeship, told DOJ attorneys to ignore court orders. The complaint to the DOJ Inspector General echoes earlier claims that Bove urged staff to mislead judges and bypass a restraining order blocking flights to El Salvador.Why It Matters: Trump is rewarding loyalists who told DOJ lawyers to ignore judges with lifetime seats on the bench. It\u2019s a raw power play to turn the courts into political weapons, gut legal checks, and protect his regime from accountability.Source: CNNUS Health, Tech Officials to Launch Data-Sharing PlanWhat Happened: Trump officials are bringing tech executives to the White House to announce a voluntary framework for sharing health data, led by RFK Jr., CMS chief Mehmet Oz, and unvetted DOGE operatives. The plan seeks private-sector commitments to standardize patient information access and improve interoperability across healthcare systems.Why It Matters: This initiative opens the door to mass data mining and political surveillance. With Kennedy, Oz, and Musk operatives shaping the system, it\u2019s setting the stage to fuse corporate power with government control.Source: BloombergVought won't rule out more rescissions funding cuts before SeptemberWhat Happened: OMB Director Russell Vought signaled the regime may impose fresh funding cuts before September, targeting the Education Department and NIH. Vought defended delaying funds and suggested more rescissions, even as he sought a 13% budget hike for his own office.Why It Matters: By branding programs as \u201cwaste\u201d and exploiting loopholes, Trump\u2019s team is consolidating fiscal control in the White House and stripping Congress of its budget authority\u2014central to Project 2025\u2019s authoritarian blueprint.Source: CBS NewsVought Accuses Fed of \u2018Fiscal Mismanagement\u2019What Happened: OMB Director Russell Vought blasted the Federal Reserve on national TV, accusing it of \u201cfiscal mismanagement\u201d over a costly headquarters renovation and criticizing Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. Why It Matters: This is another attempt to bully the Fed into lowering rates and manufacture grounds to fire Powell. By publicly undermining him and threatening removal, Trump continues to try and seize control over the independent Federal Reserve\u2014vital to keeping the economy stable.Source: The HillGhislaine Maxwell's meetings with Justice Department shrouded in secrecyWhat Happened: Deputy AG Todd Blanche met privately with Ghislaine Maxwell for two days, granting her limited immunity while excluding Epstein prosecutors and victims\u2019 lawyers. The DOJ has since shut down the broader Epstein probe and fired the lead prosecutor.Why It Matters: With Trump\u2019s former lawyer running the show, this reeks of a cover-up\u2014shielding Trump and burying the Epstein case to protect the powerful. It also raises the possibility of a pardon being dangled in exchange for helping cover up Trump\u2019s ties to Epstein.Source: NBC News and ABC NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFact check: Trump calls to prosecute Beyonc\u00e9 based on a nonexistent $11 million paymentWhat Happened: Trump demanded Beyonc\u00e9 be prosecuted, lying that she was paid $11 million to endorse Kamala Harris. Harris\u2019s campaign legally paid $165,000 to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s production company for event costs\u2014as reported in financial disclosures.Why It Matters: Trump is using unfounded accusations to smear a political opponent and threaten prosecution over routine campaign activity, weaponizing legal rhetoric to delegitimize the Democratic Party. This tactic mirrors autocratic playbooks: criminalize your rivals, distort the law, and flood the public with fabricated lies.Source: CNNTrump Doubles Down on Claims Harris Paid for Endorsements, Says She Should Be \u2018Prosecuted\u2019What Happened: Trump accused Kamala Harris of illegally paying celebrities for endorsements during the 2024 campaign, claiming she funneled millions to Beyonc\u00e9, Oprah, and Al Sharpton. He demanded prosecutions despite FEC records only showing standard production reimbursements, which are legal and common in campaign events.Why It Matters: Trump is deploying baseless accusations to smear Kamala Harris and intimidate critics, threatening prosecution over routine campaign practices. The tactic mirrors authoritarian playbooks\u2014criminalizing rivals, distorting the law, and flooding the public with conspiracies\u2014while also attempting to weaken Harris, a potential 2028 presidential contender.Source: The HillUnder Trump, Paramount\u2019s Merger Deal Must Include a \u201cBias Monitor\u201dWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s FCC approved the $8 billion Paramount\u2013Skydance merger\u2014but only after requiring a \u201cbias monitor\u201d to oversee CBS News and forcing the company to eliminate all DEI programs. The deal follows Trump\u2019s $16 million settlement with Paramount and the abrupt cancellation of The Colbert Report after the host criticized the network\u2019s capitulation.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal power to purge dissenting voices, erase diversity efforts, and turn media companies into loyalist echo chambers.Source: Mother JonesDenied Federal Flood Relief, a Maryland Town Is Left on Its OwnWhat Happened: FEMA denied $15.8 million in disaster aid to Allegany and Garrett counties after devastating May floods destroyed homes, schools, and infrastructure in Westernport, Maryland. The denial has left the overwhelmingly pro-Trump town scrambling for funds, relying on limited state aid and nonprofits as winter approaches.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing disaster aid, favoring allies while withholding relief from blue states and even GOP areas. Delayed repairs will strand families before winter.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE targets Los Angeles homeless shelterWhat Happened: ICE agents have repeatedly staked out a Hollywood homeless shelter for young immigrants, arresting residents\u2014including two Venezuelan men returning from work. Staff now escort asylum-seekers to court and errands in unmarked vehicles. Other shelters in LA and San Diego report similar ICE activity.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign has extended into homeless shelters, stoking fear and racial profiling in already vulnerable communities. Even documented immigrants are being swept up, with Black and brown residents afraid to go outside.Source: NBC NewsDemocratic lawmakers seek answers from homeland security head about masked Ice agentsWhat Happened: Democratic Reps. Robert Garcia and Summer Lee sent a letter demanding answers from Kristi Noem about ICE agents conducting arrests while masked and unidentifiable. The lawmakers cited growing civil rights concerns, rising impersonation crimes, and recent arrests\u2014like that of a Tufts student by masked agents\u2014as proof the practice is eroding public trust and due process.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s ICE is operating like a secret police force\u2014masking identities, using unmarked vehicles, and bypassing basic constitutional norms\u2014tactics used in Russia. This mirrors tactics of authoritarian states that disappear people in broad daylight under the guise of law enforcement.Source: The GuardianImmigration agents told a teenage US citizen: \u2018You\u2019ve got no rights.\u2019 He secretly recorded his brutal arrestWhat Happened: Kenny Laynez-Ambrosio, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen, filmed his violent arrest by Florida troopers and masked Border Patrol agents who used chokeholds and stun guns on his undocumented friends. Agents mocked the arrest, saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got no rights\u201d and joked about \u201c$30,000 bonuses.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation crackdown is fueling violent, quota-driven arrests\u2014and targeting citizens. Masked agents are eroding civil rights, endangering public trust\u2014with no oversight or accountability.Source: The GuardianHouse Democrats Are Calling On DHS To Investigate a New York City ICE FacilityWhat Happened: House Democrats are demanding an investigation into ICE\u2019s covert detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza in NYC, where detainees report being denied food and medical care. Lawmakers have been blocked from oversight visits, despite legal guarantees, as ICE claims the building is merely a \u201cprocessing center.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump officials are running a shadow detention facility in a federal office tower, dodging oversight and basic human rights obligations. Denying congressional access and transparency underscores an expansion of unchecked power.Source: NOTUSVenezuelan Little League team denied entry into US amid Trump travel banWhat Happened: A Venezuelan youth baseball team was barred from competing in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina after being denied travel visas under Trump\u2019s expanded travel ban. Despite traveling to Colombia early to secure visas, the team was replaced by a runner-up from Mexico.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s travel restrictions are punishing children and damaging international goodwill. Even with supposed exceptions for athletes, Marco Rubio let a team of teenagers be blocked\u2014hurting U.S. diplomacy and its image ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.Source: PoliticoShe fled Cuba for asylum \u2013 then was snatched from a US immigration courtroomWhat Happened: Jenny, a 25-year-old Cuban asylum seeker who legally entered under Biden\u2019s CBP One program, was seized by masked ICE agents after a routine hearing\u2014even though a judge allowed her to remain while awaiting another hearing. She\u2019s now detained with her case reassigned to a harsher judge. Why It Matters: Trump is turning immigration courts into ambush zones\u2014where legal migrants are hunted, asylum rights stripped, and due process obliterated\u2014ushering in an authoritarian system built on entrapment.Source: The GuardianRenaming of military bases stirs debate over Confederate tiesWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth has reverted seven Army bases renamed in 2023 to their original Confederate-linked names, using non-Confederate soldiers with matching surnames to bypass federal bans. Other assets, including the USNS Harvey Milk, have also been renamed to remove DEI-linked honors.Why It Matters: The move rolls back racial justice reforms, appeases far-right sentiment, and erases efforts to diversify military history and recognition.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Team Told to Stop Polygraph Tests After White House ComplaintWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth\u2019s leak hunt using polygraph tests inside the Pentagon was halted after a senior adviser complained to the White House. Multiple staff had already been tested, and top officers were threatened before Trump\u2019s aides intervened.Why It Matters: This reveals paranoia, chaos, and internal real \u201cwitch hunts\u201d at the Pentagon, showing how Trump\u2019s Defense Department is destabilizing military leadership instead of focusing on national security.Source: Washington PostA Clash Over a Promotion Puts Hegseth at Odds With His GeneralsWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth refused to promote Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, first citing baseless leak suspicions, then alleging ties to ousted Gen. Mark Milley. The move drew rare pushback from Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine. Hegseth has repeatedly fired senior officers, used polygraph tests, and clashed with staff as he purges diversity programs and enforces loyalty tests.Why It Matters: Hegseth is reshaping military leadership around personal loyalty to Trump rather than merit. This politicization of promotions undermines trust, weakens military readiness, and shatters the apolitical tradition that underpins U.S. national defense.Source: New York TimesDoge reportedly using AI tool to create \u2018delete list\u2019 of federal regulationsWhat Happened: Internal documents reveal Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE agency is using an AI tool to create a \u201cdelete list\u201d targeting 100,000 federal regulations for elimination by January. The tool\u2014developed under Musk\u2014has already been used by HUD and the CFPB to draft deregulatory actions with minimal human review.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s team is using AI to systematically gut consumer, climate, and housing protections\u2014without oversight or accountability\u2014paving the way for unchecked corporate abuse, mass deregulation, and long-term harm to public health and safety.Source: The Guardian and Washington PostAs the ADA turns 35, groups fighting for disability rights could see their federal dollars slashedWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget proposal would eliminate three major federal grants for disability rights centers and deeply cut a fourth, wiping out over 60% of their funding. These independent advocacy groups investigate abuse, fight discrimination, and help people with disabilities access essential services like Medicaid.Why It Matters: This would be the most devastating cut in the 50-year history of disability advocacy programs. It would cripple oversight of abusive institutions and strip millions of Americans with disabilities of critical legal protections and community support.Source: Associated PressTop medical body concerned over RFK Jr\u2019s reported plans to cut preventive health panelWhat Happened: The American Medical Association urged RFK Jr. to abandon plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which he reportedly called \u201ctoo woke.\u201d The panel sets recommendations for insurer-covered screenings like cancer, HIV, and mental health checks under the ACA.Why It Matters: This move is part of Trump\u2019s broader purge of medical experts and attack on science. Politically gutting a nonpartisan health panel will restrict access to lifesaving screenings and weaponize public health policy.Source: The GuardianHegseth\u2019s Ousting of Female Leaders May Have \u2018Chilling Effect\u2019 at PentagonWhat Happened: At least five top female military leaders\u2014including Vice Adm. Yvette Davids and Adm. Lisa Franchetti\u2014have been purged or sidelined since Trump\u2019s return. Pete Hegseth, who has disparaged women in combat, has scrapped DEI programs and advanced \u201cmerit-based\u201d policies critics call a cover for ousting women and minorities from leadership.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate rollback of decades of gender integration in the armed forces. Morale, retention, and recruitment will deteriorate as the Pentagon turns into a boys\u2019 club, erasing women from senior military power.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchBerlin left in the dark as Washington weighs troop cuts in EuropeWhat Happened: Germany is urgently lobbying to avert a U.S. military drawdown as Trump\u2019s Global Force Posture Review considers slashing up to 30% of American forces in Europe. Despite appeals from Defense Minister Pistorius and Chancellor Merz, Berlin has no clarity on the future of 35,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.Why It Matters: A large withdrawal would weaken NATO\u2019s deterrence, undercut support for Ukraine, and destabilize Europe\u2019s security as Russia threatens further aggression against NATO countries.Source: Politico EUTrump covets rare earth riches, but Greenland plans to mine its own businessWhat Happened: Trump is pressuring Greenland to cede control of its massive rare earth reserves, even reportedly floating invasion threats. Greenland\u2019s new leadership plans to mine independently with Western investment while resisting both U.S. dominance and Chinese influence.Why It Matters: Greenland\u2019s decision to mine independently is a direct rebuke to Trump\u2019s annexation threats. Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia depletes Soviet arms, heavily relies on foreign supplies for Ukraine war, analysis suggestsWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s Soviet-era weapons reserves have dropped 50% since 2022, forcing heavy reliance on foreign suppliers. Most ammunition now comes from North Korea, with explosive materials from Iran and China.Why It Matters: Russia can no longer sustain its war effort alone. Moscow\u2019s deepening reliance on authoritarian allies like North Korea, China, and Iran shows how this coalition is propping up Putin\u2019s genocidal war.Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsKicking the can down the road on tariffs won't work for this Maryland manufacturerWhat Happened: Independent Can Company, a 95-year-old Maryland manufacturer, has raised prices twice this year after Trump doubled steel tariffs to 50%. CEO Rick Huether says tariffs on foreign tinplate\u2014mostly unavailable in the U.S.\u2014now make up 75% of product costs.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade chaos is crushing U.S. manufacturers, driving up costs, killing jobs, and destabilizing small businesses he vowed to protect.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News8/2- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Texas Democrats escalate fight against Republican-led redistricting efforts with Pritzker, Newsom meetingsWhat Happened: Texas Democrats met with Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker to strategize against Republican plans to redraw congressional maps mid-decade. The redistricting, backed by Trump and triggered by DOJ claims of racial gerrymandering, could net Republicans five seats and help cement their House majority.Source: ABC NewsHouse Democrats Are Calling On DHS To Investigate a New York City ICE FacilityWhat Happened: Reps. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and Adriano Espaillat are demanding a DHS investigation into alleged abuses at 26 Federal Plaza in NYC, where ICE is detaining immigrants without food, medicine, or oversight. Lawmakers have been repeatedly denied access to the site, despite federal laws permitting unannounced inspections.Source: NOTUSScotland Protests Trump with Wit, Bite, and BagpipesWhat Happened: As Trump visited Scotland to play golf and meet EU and UK leaders, locals staged colorful protests across Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dumfries. Demonstrators blasted bagpipes, displayed witty anti-Trump signs, and wrote messages in the sand denouncing his politics and long-standing disputes over his golf courses.Source: Washington PostImmigration judges fired by Trump say they will fight backWhat Happened: Over 50 immigration judges have been purged since Trump\u2019s return to office, including senior leaders and new appointees. Judges Jennifer Peyton and Carla Espinoza are appealing their dismissals, alleging political targeting, discrimination, and retaliation for rulings unfavorable to Trump\u2019s agenda.

Institutional Capture and Power Consolidation \u2014 From voter roll purges to lifetime judicial appointments for loyalists, Trump is dismantling democratic safeguards and reshaping the judiciary and DOJ to shield his regime from accountability.Crony Capitalism and Systemic Corruption \u2014 Billions in taxpayer dollars are funneled to private detention firms, for-profit colleges, and political donors, turning public policy into a pay-to-play scheme enriching Trump\u2019s allies.Information Control and State Propaganda \u2014 Federal power is weaponized to silence dissent, impose loyalty monitors on networks, and gut diversity programs, transforming independent media into state-aligned propaganda machines.Erosion of Civil Liberties and Rule of Law \u2014 Masked ICE raids, secret detention centers, and ambushes in immigration courts erode constitutional protections, turning law enforcement into a de facto secret police force.Rollback of Equality and Civil Rights \u2014 Military purges, Confederate glorification, and attacks on DEI initiatives mark a deliberate reversal of racial justice and gender equality in federal institutions.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Meet the man he wants leading the charge</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has nominated Nicholas Kent, a former for-profit college executive and lobbyist, to serve as Under Secretary of Education. Kent, whose former employer settled for $13 million over student aid fraud, has long opposed regulations on for-profit colleges, and his nomination advanced without a public Senate hearing.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This hands federal student aid and college oversight to someone tied to an industry notorious for defrauding students. It\\u2019s a deliberate shift away from supporting public and traditional higher education toward channeling billions into for-profit institutions.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2025/07/26/trump-education-department-nicholas-kent-under-secretary/85243626007/?tbref=hp\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>His Former Company Got Caught Employing Undocumented Workers.

Albers previously co-owned TentLogix, which pleaded guilty in 2019 to illegally hiring undocumented workers, yet now stands to profit from mass deportations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This showcases the Trump economy of cruelty\\u2014where political allies with shady records cash in on migrant abuses.

Critical areas like shipbuilding and R&amp;D are now being run by acting political appointees instead of seasoned civil servants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This internal power grab exposes more chaos and distrust within the Pentagon as loyalists clash over a $43 billion naval expansion.
