  "content": "The F.B.I. headquarters in Washington in November. The senior bureau employees given the apparent ultimatum had been promoted under the agency\u2019s former director, Christopher A. Wray. Credit...Rod Lamkey Jr. for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Jan 30, 2025Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Raised Millions From Crypto Firms for His InaugurationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s inaugural committee raised millions from cryptocurrency firms, energy producers, and Big Tech\u2014including Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, Chevron, Amazon, and Meta. Crypto firms contributed over $5 million, while energy and healthcare giants, such as Johnson & Johnson and Bayer, also made large donations. Trump has since appointed a crypto czar and issued executive orders benefiting key donors, including freezing offshore wind power permits while boosting domestic energy.Why It Matters: These donations are prime examples of pay-to-play schemes, as industries that heavily financed Trump\u2019s return are already seeing favorable policy shifts. The mix of crypto, Big Oil, and pharma lobbying money signals a potential prioritization of corporate donors\u2019 interests over public needs\u2014a classic case of influence peddling in government and the rise of an oligarchy.Source: BloombergWhite House Press Secretary\u2019s Campaign Took Illegal Donations From Businesses \u2014 And Hasn\u2019t Returned the MoneyWhat Happened: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s failed congressional campaign allegedly accepted illegal business donations and failed to refund $326,370 in excessive contributions, violating campaign finance laws. The campaign still owes nearly $38,000 to 30 businesses and hasn\u2019t paid vendors, including her consulting firm.Why It Matters: The unresolved debt, failure to follow FEC rules, and violations raise ethical concerns about Leavitt\u2019s financial integrity and security clearance as she serves in a top White House role. This highlights more corruption within Trump\u2019s regime.Source: NOTUSTo Pay for Trump Tax Cuts, House GOP Floats Plan to Slash Benefits for the Poor and Working ClassWhat Happened: House Republicans are pushing massive tax cuts for corporations and the ultrawealthy, including eliminating the estate tax and slashing corporate tax rates, while proposing deep cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for families and single parents to offset the revenue loss.Why It Matters: This plan redistributes wealth upwards, further increasing economic inequality and undercutting support for low-income Americans. Slashing Medicaid could leave millions without healthcare, while eliminating tax breaks for parents will out more financial pressure on working families.Source: ProPublicaAmazon Increases Ad Spending on Elon Musk\u2019s X Amid Political RealignmentWhat Happened: Amazon reversed course and significantly increased its advertising spending on Elon Musk\u2019s X after largely boycotting the platform over concerns about hate speech and content moderation. Apple is also considering returning to X, reflecting a broader trend of corporations re-engaging with Musk as he gains influence in Trump\u2019s regime. Why It Matters: This reflects a shift toward corporate alignment with Musk and Trump, driven by financial pressure and political influence. With Musk holding a key government role and X struggling financially, companies feel compelled to return to avoid retaliation or secure federal contracts. Similar tactics are used in Russia, where businesses support the regime to maintain favor and avoid state pressure.Source: The Wall Street JournalNot Just Big Tech: Under-the-Radar Corporations Rushed to Donate to Trump\u2019s InaugurationWhat Happened: Major corporations, including ID.me, CoreCivic, Carrier, and a Chinese-owned agriculture firm, quietly donated millions to Trump\u2019s inauguration while holding lucrative government contracts or lobbying interests. Some, like ID.me, had been investigated by Congress for fraud and privacy concerns.Why It Matters: These donations expose blatant pay-to-play schemes, with companies holding federal contracts leveraging financial contributions to gain influence over Trump. The lack of transparency, combined with Trump\u2019s openness to unlimited corporate donations, underscores the mass corruption at play.Source: NOTUS\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsFederal Purge at the FBI IntensifiesWhat Happened: Several top FBI officials, including about six Executive Assistant Directors overseeing criminal, national security, and cyber investigations, were told to resign or face demotion. These career civil servants, appointed under former Director Christopher Wray, cannot be fired without cause. The move is part of Trump\u2019s broader purge of federal agencies.Why It Matters: This purge destabilizes the FBI's leadership, removing seasoned professionals in favor of Trump loyalists. It follows Trump's mass firings of inspectors general and DOJ prosecutors involved in his previous investigations, demonstrating his intentions to politicize and weaponize federal law enforcement. Trump\u2019s dangerous FBI nominee, Kash Patel, claims the agency won\u2019t take retributive action\u2014despite his lengthy retribution list and the steps of retaliation that have already been taken.Source: NBC News'Fear' and 'chaos' grip federal workers as Trump rapidly remakes the governmentWhat Happened: Fear and confusion have gripped federal workers as the Trump regime rapidly bulldozes the federal workforce, issuing sweeping executive orders to end remote work, dismantle diversity programs, fire senior officials, and force resignations. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sent employees an email offering a \"deferred resignation\" program\u2014orchestrated by Musk. USAID, Social Security, and other agencies are seeing staff placed on leave, forced out, or reassigned at an unprecedented pace.Why It Matters: Trump's aggressive purge of career civil servants replaces independent officials with loyalists, turning federal agencies into political arms of his regime. These mass firings and ideological purges mirror Russia\u2019s model, weakening institutions and enabling corruption and authoritarian control.Source: NBC NewsMusk-Backed Takeover of Federal Tech AgencyWhat Happened: Elon Musk ally Thomas Shedd has taken control of Technology Transformation Services (TTS)\u2014a critical government IT agency\u2014leading to chaos, secrecy, and surveillance-like tactics. Employees have been forced into unannounced \u201csneak attack\u201d meetings with unknown individuals who lack official government email addresses. Some of these individuals appear to be college students with disturbingly high clearance levels. Musk himself was spotted at the agency's Washington, D.C., office, fueling concerns about his direct influence over government tech infrastructure.Why It Matters: TTS manages sensitive federal data and technology platforms across multiple agencies. This Musk-led coup\u2014backed by Trump\u2019s unauthorized Department of Government Efficiency\u2014gives politically aligned private sector figures unprecedented access to federal systems, raising grave national security risks. Employees fear this is part of a broader ideological purge and surveillance push that could weaponize federal technology against government workers and Americans.Source: WIREDTrump Orders Agencies to Find More DEI Workers to AxWhat Happened: Trump is expanding his DEI purge, demanding agencies identify and eliminate more diversity-related positions, place employees on paid leave, and cancel DEI contracts worth billions. Federal workers are now being required to report colleagues involved in diversity initiatives, with threats of consequences for noncompliance.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass purge of DEI staff enforces ideological loyalty tests across federal agencies, mirroring Russia\u2019s use of snitch tactics to root out dissent. By dismantling diversity programs and pressuring employees to rat out colleagues, his regime prioritizes political conformity over institutional integrity, consolidating power through fear and surveillance.Source: The Wall Street JournalWhite House Considers Dozens of New Ways to Seize Spending PowerWhat Happened: Trump is exploring ways to bypass Congress' control over federal spending, weaken independent agencies, and make it easier to fire government workers\u2014including reclassifying civil servants, cutting pay raises, and shifting retirement costs to employees. The White House is considering legal challenges to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limits the president\u2019s ability to withhold spending approved by Congress.Why It Matters: This blatant power grab threatens the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, and will allow Trump to redirect federal funds without congressional approval. A key authoritarian tactic.Source: BloombergSubscribe\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEPA dismisses science advisersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime dismissed members of the EPA\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and Science Advisory Board (SAB), calling it a \"reset\" to undo what they claim was \u2018politicization\u2019 under Biden. The move mirrors Trump\u2019s first term when his EPA administrators similarly purged scientific advisers and replaced them with industry-friendly appointees.Why It Matters: This undermines environmental policymaking by sidelining independent scientific experts in favor of political and corporate interests. A weakened EPA advisory board will greenlight deregulation, favoring polluters over public health and environmental protection.Source: The HillU.S. Treasury Department Withdraws from Global Climate Change Regulatory GroupWhat Happened: The U.S. Treasury Department announced its withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a global group focused on managing climate risk in financial systems. The move aligns with Trump\u2019s broader effort to dismantle climate-related financial oversight.Why It Matters: This decision weakens global financial coordination on climate risks and signals that the U.S. is retreating from international regulatory cooperation. It reflects a broader strategy to politicize financial institutions, favor fossil fuel interests, and roll back environmental regulations.Source: ReutersDOT Memo Directs Funds to Communities With Higher \u2018Marriage And Birth Rates\u2019What Happened: The Department of Transportation issued a memo directing federal transportation funds to communities with higher-than-average marriage and birth rates, effectively prioritizing conservative-leaning areas. The memo also requires funding recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, taking direct aim at sanctuary cities.Why It Matters: The weaponization of federal funds to reward communities that align with MAGA policies\u2014and punish those that don\u2019t\u2014marks an unprecedented politicization of the Department of Transportation\u2019s grant programs. The directive will disproportionately impact diverse urban areas while favoring predominantly white, conservative states.Source: HuffPost\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump\u2019s Kremlin-Style Presser Weaponized Tragedy and Blamed DEI What Happened: Trump lies and blamed the Biden administration\u2019s DEI policies for a deadly plane crash over the Potomac River, despite admitting he had no evidence. He lied that the FAA was hiring air traffic controllers with severe disabilities under DEI initiatives, ignoring the fact that these programs began under his first term.Why It Matters: Trump exploited a national tragedy to push his anti-DEI agenda, spreading lies that diversity compromises safety. This propaganda tactic, common in Russia, distorts facts to justify a regime agenda while stoking division for political gain. Notably, he appointed a new FAA head today after firing the previous one last week.Source: The New York TimesUSAID Official Placed on Leave for Refusing Illegal FiringsWhat Happened: The head of Employee and Labor Relations at USAID has been placed on administrative leave after refusing to execute illegally politically motivated firings ordered by Trump\u2019s unauthorized Department of Government Efficiency and senior political appointees. The official reportedly resisted efforts to terminate career civil servants without legal justification, raising concerns about the legality of the purge.Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s authoritarian takeover of the federal government, using unauthorized DOGE to purge nonpartisan officials and replace them with loyalists. Targeting civil servants for upholding the law erodes institutional integrity, dismantles employee protections, and undermines the rule of law\u2014hallmarks of autocratic regimes.Source: Dylan Matthews (Vox) on XParamount in Settlement Talks With Trump Over \u201860 Minutes\u2019 LawsuitWhat Happened: Paramount is negotiating a settlement with Trump over his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS for allegedly editing a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing of the settlement talks has raised concerns, as Paramount is seeking FCC approval for a major merger with Skydance, and the agency is now led by a Trump appointee, Brendan Carr.Why It Matters: If Paramount concedes to Trump\u2019s demands, it sets a dangerous precedent where media companies bow to political and legal pressure, eroding press freedom. This signals a new tactic for Trump to weaponize regulatory power against critical outlets. Following settlements from ABC News and Meta, CBS now faces similar pressure\u2014sending a chilling message that media must comply or face consequences, mirroring state-controlled media tactics seen in authoritarian regimes.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsPentagon scrubs Biden-era abortion travel policyWhat Happened: The Pentagon revoked a Biden-era policy that covered travel costs for service members and their dependents who needed to travel out of state for abortions or reproductive care. The move follows Trump's executive order enforcing the Hyde Amendment, effectively restricting access to reproductive healthcare for service members stationed in states with abortion bans.Why It Matters: This decision disproportionately impacts female service members, stripping them of bodily autonomy and restricting their healthcare options based on state laws they have no control over. It sends a clear message of gender inequality within the military and risks exacerbating recruitment and retention challenges, weakening overall military readiness.Source: The HillPentagon intelligence agency pauses observances for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, JuneteenthWhat Happened: The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has paused all observances of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, Holocaust Days of Remembrance, and other cultural or historical events following Trump's executive order banning DEI programs across federal agencies. The move affects 11 annual observances, including Black History Month, Women\u2019s History Month, and Pride Month.Why It Matters: This erases recognition of marginalized communities and historical injustices, reinforcing Trump's broader effort to reshape federal institutions into ideological strongholds and rewrite history. By targeting cultural observances, the regime is further entrenching nationalism while dismantling diversity initiatives that promote inclusion and historical awareness.Source: The HillNative Americans say tribal members harassed by immigration agentsWhat Happened: Native American tribal members report harassment by ICE agents amid Trump's immigration crackdown. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and Democratic lawmakers allege that ICE agents have stopped and questioned U.S. citizens based on their appearance, including a Mescalero Apache tribal member who was asked for proof of citizenship.Why It Matters: The targeting of Native Americans by federal immigration agents raises serious concerns about civil rights violations. Native Americans now feel compelled to carry additional documentation to prove their status, highlighting broader issues of discrimination and racial profiling.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial WatchRubio on buying Greenland: \u2018This is not a joke\u2019What Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Trump\u2019s push to buy Greenland is serious, citing \u2018national security\u2019 concerns over China\u2019s potential military expansion in the Arctic. Trump has argued that Denmark cannot defend Greenland and that the U.S. should take control of it. Denmark strongly rejected the proposal, with Greenlandic leaders reaffirming their sovereignty, and European leaders scrambling to devise a plan to protect Greenland against potential U.S. military action.Why It Matters: This move signals an aggressive expansionist policy, risking diplomatic fallout with Denmark and NATO allies. While framed as a counter to Chinese influence, the push raises geopolitical tensions and questions about U.S. imperial ambitions in the Arctic. Source: The HillGoogle reclassifies U.S. as \u2018sensitive country\u2019 alongside China, Russia after Trump\u2019s \u2018Gulf of America\u2019 commentsWhat Happened: Google reclassified the U.S. as a \"sensitive country\"\u2014a label usually reserved for nations with authoritarian governments or territorial disputes\u2014after Trump ordered the official renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\" The designation puts the U.S. alongside China, Russia, and Iraq in Google\u2019s internal systems.Why It Matters: This move signals growing instability and political interference in government mapping and tech regulation. As U.S. institutions mirror tactics used by authoritarian states, global tech firms may adjust policies to account for a shifting political and regulatory environment.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers$5M+ \u2013 Total contributions from cryptocurrency firms to Trump\u2019s inauguration, signaling the industry\u2019s deep investment in the regime.$2M \u2013 Chevron\u2019s donation to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, nearly quadrupling its 2017 contribution.6+ \u2013 Executive Assistant Directors at the FBI reportedly forced to resign or face demotion as part of Trump\u2019s federal purge.$1B \u2013 Estimated value of federal DEI contracts canceled across multiple agencies.$326,370 \u2013 Unreturned excess donations and outstanding debts from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s failed congressional campaign.17% \u2013 Women\u2019s share of the U.S. military, many of whom will be directly impacted by the Pentagon\u2019s abortion travel policy rollback.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump\u2019s Spending Freeze Showdown \u2013 Legal battles over Trump\u2019s federal spending freeze, which was briefly rescinded but expected to return in some form.

Crypto firms contributed over $5 million, while energy and healthcare giants, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bayer, also made large donations. Trump has since appointed a crypto czar and issued executive orders benefiting key donors, including freezing offshore wind power permits while boosting domestic energy.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> These donations are prime examples of pay-to-play schemes, as industries that heavily financed Trump\u2019s return are already seeing favorable policy shifts. The mix of crypto, Big Oil, and pharma lobbying money signals a potential prioritization of corporate donors\u2019 interests over public needs\u2014a classic case of influence peddling in government and the rise of an oligarchy.</span></p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/trump-raised-millions-from-crypto-firms-for-his-inauguration?srnd=phx-politics\" rel=\"\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>White House Press Secretary\u2019s Campaign Took Illegal Donations From Businesses \u2014 And Hasn\u2019t Returned the Money</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7white-house-press-secretarys-campaign-took-illegal-donations-from-businesses-and-hasnt-returned-the-money\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/156135564/white-house-press-secretarys-campaign-took-illegal-donations-from-businesses-and-hasnt-returned-the-money\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s failed congressional campaign allegedly accepted illegal business donations and failed to refund $326,370 in excessive contributions, violating campaign finance laws.

Crypto firms contributed over $5 million, while energy and healthcare giants, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bayer, also made large donations. Trump has since appointed a crypto czar and issued executive orders benefiting key donors, including freezing offshore wind power permits while boosting domestic energy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These donations are prime examples of pay-to-play schemes, as industries that heavily financed Trump\\u2019s return are already seeing favorable policy shifts. The mix of crypto, Big Oil, and pharma lobbying money signals a potential prioritization of corporate donors\\u2019 interests over public needs\\u2014a classic case of influence peddling in government and the rise of an oligarchy.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/trump-raised-millions-from-crypto-firms-for-his-inauguration?srnd=phx-politics\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>White House Press Secretary\\u2019s Campaign Took Illegal Donations From Businesses \\u2014 And Hasn\\u2019t Returned the Money</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt\\u2019s failed congressional campaign allegedly accepted illegal business donations and failed to refund $326,370 in excessive contributions, violating campaign finance laws. The campaign still owes nearly $38,000 to 30 businesses and hasn\\u2019t paid vendors, including her consulting firm.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The unresolved debt, failure to follow FEC rules, and violations raise ethical concerns about Leavitt\\u2019s financial integrity and security clearance as she serves in a top White House role. This highlights more corruption within Trump\\u2019s regime.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/whitehouse/white-house-press-secretary-karoline-leavitt-campaign-donations-businesses\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>To Pay for Trump Tax Cuts, House GOP Floats Plan to Slash Benefits for the Poor and Working Class</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Republicans are pushing massive tax cuts for corporations and the ultrawealthy, including eliminating the estate tax and slashing corporate tax rates, while proposing deep cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for families and single parents to offset the revenue loss.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This plan redistributes wealth upwards, further increasing economic inequality and undercutting support for low-income Americans. Slashing Medicaid could leave millions without healthcare, while eliminating tax breaks for parents will out more financial pressure on working families.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-cuts-congress-republicans-plan-slash-benefits\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Amazon Increases Ad Spending on Elon Musk\\u2019s X Amid Political Realignment</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Amazon reversed course and significantly increased its advertising spending on Elon Musk\\u2019s X after largely boycotting the platform over concerns about hate speech and content moderation. Apple is also considering returning to X, reflecting a broader trend of corporations re-engaging with Musk as he gains influence in Trump\\u2019s regime. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This reflects a shift toward corporate alignment with Musk and Trump, driven by financial pressure and political influence. With Musk holding a key government role and X struggling financially, companies feel compelled to return to avoid retaliation or secure federal contracts. Similar tactics are used in Russia, where businesses support the regime to maintain favor and avoid state pressure.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/amazon-raises-its-ad-spending-on-elon-musks-x-in-major-reversal-8a27228b?mod=hp_lead_pos2\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Not Just Big Tech: Under-the-Radar Corporations Rushed to Donate to Trump\\u2019s Inauguration</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Major corporations, including ID.me, CoreCivic, Carrier, and a Chinese-owned agriculture firm, quietly donated millions to Trump\\u2019s inauguration while holding lucrative government contracts or lobbying interests. Some, like ID.me, had been investigated by Congress for fraud and privacy concerns.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These donations expose blatant pay-to-play schemes, with companies holding federal contracts leveraging financial contributions to gain influence over Trump. The lack of transparency, combined with Trump\\u2019s openness to unlimited corporate donations, underscores the mass corruption at play.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/donald-trump/corporate-donations-trump-inauguration\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Federal Purge at the FBI Intensifies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Several top FBI officials, including about six Executive Assistant Directors overseeing criminal, national security, and cyber investigations, were told to resign or face demotion. These career civil servants, appointed under former Director Christopher Wray, cannot be fired without cause. The move is part of Trump\\u2019s broader purge of federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This purge destabilizes the FBI's leadership, removing seasoned professionals in favor of Trump loyalists. It follows Trump's mass firings of inspectors general and DOJ prosecutors involved in his previous investigations, demonstrating his intentions to politicize and weaponize federal law enforcement. Trump\\u2019s dangerous FBI nominee, Kash Patel, claims the agency won\\u2019t take retributive action\\u2014despite his lengthy retribution list and the steps of retaliation that have already been taken.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/several-top-fbi-officials-are-told-resign-face-demotion-trump-continue-rcna190095\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>'Fear' and 'chaos' grip federal workers as Trump rapidly remakes the government</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Fear and confusion have gripped federal workers as the Trump regime rapidly bulldozes the federal workforce, issuing sweeping executive orders to end remote work, dismantle diversity programs, fire senior officials, and force resignations. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sent employees an email offering a \\\\\\\"deferred resignation\\\\\\\" program\\u2014orchestrated by Musk. USAID, Social Security, and other agencies are seeing staff placed on leave, forced out, or reassigned at an unprecedented pace.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump's aggressive purge of career civil servants replaces independent officials with loyalists, turning federal agencies into political arms of his regime. These mass firings and ideological purges mirror Russia\\u2019s model, weakening institutions and enabling corruption and authoritarian control.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fear-chaos-grip-federal-workers-trump-remakes-government-rcna189746\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk-Backed Takeover of Federal Tech Agency</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk ally Thomas Shedd has taken control of Technology Transformation Services (TTS)\\u2014a critical government IT agency\\u2014leading to chaos, secrecy, and surveillance-like tactics. Employees have been forced into unannounced \\u201Csneak attack\\u201D meetings with unknown individuals who lack official government email addresses. Some of these individuals appear to be college students with disturbingly high clearance levels. Musk himself was spotted at the agency's Washington, D.C., office, fueling concerns about his direct influence over government tech infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>TTS manages sensitive federal data and technology platforms across multiple agencies. This Musk-led coup\\u2014backed by Trump\\u2019s unauthorized Department of Government Efficiency\\u2014gives politically aligned private sector figures unprecedented access to federal systems, raising grave national security risks. Employees fear this is part of a broader ideological purge and surveillance push that could weaponize federal technology against government workers and Americans.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-tech-workers-gsa-tts/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Orders Agencies to Find More DEI Workers to Ax</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is expanding his DEI purge, demanding agencies identify and eliminate more diversity-related positions, place employees on paid leave, and cancel DEI contracts worth billions. Federal workers are now being required to report colleagues involved in diversity initiatives, with threats of consequences for noncompliance.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s mass purge of DEI staff enforces ideological loyalty tests across federal agencies, mirroring Russia\\u2019s use of snitch tactics to root out dissent. By dismantling diversity programs and pressuring employees to rat out colleagues, his regime prioritizes political conformity over institutional integrity, consolidating power through fear and surveillance.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-orders-agencies-to-find-more-dei-workers-to-ax-7b627c36?mod=politics_lead_story\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>White House Considers Dozens of New Ways to Seize Spending Power</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is exploring ways to bypass Congress' control over federal spending, weaken independent agencies, and make it easier to fire government workers\\u2014including reclassifying civil servants, cutting pay raises, and shifting retirement costs to employees. The White House is considering legal challenges to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limits the president\\u2019s ability to withhold spending approved by Congress.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This blatant power grab threatens the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, and will allow Trump to redirect federal funds without congressional approval. A key authoritarian tactic.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/white-house-eyes-fight-with-congress-courts-over-spending-power?srnd=homepage-americas&amp;sref=nXmOg68r&amp;embedded-checkout=true\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>EPA dismisses science advisers</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s regime dismissed members of the EPA\\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and Science Advisory Board (SAB), calling it a \\\\\\\"reset\\\\\\\" to undo what they claim was \\u2018politicization\\u2019 under Biden. The move mirrors Trump\\u2019s first term when his EPA administrators similarly purged scientific advisers and replaced them with industry-friendly appointees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This undermines environmental policymaking by sidelining independent scientific experts in favor of political and corporate interests. A weakened EPA advisory board will greenlight deregulation, favoring polluters over public health and environmental protection.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/energy-environment/5117647-epa-dismisses-science-advisers/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>U.S. Treasury Department Withdraws from Global Climate Change Regulatory Group</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. Treasury Department announced its withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a global group focused on managing climate risk in financial systems. The move aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader effort to dismantle climate-related financial oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This decision weakens global financial coordination on climate risks and signals that the U.S. is retreating from international regulatory cooperation. It reflects a broader strategy to politicize financial institutions, favor fossil fuel interests, and roll back environmental regulations.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-treasury-department-withdraws-global-regulatory-climate-change-group-2025-01-30/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOT Memo Directs Funds to Communities With Higher \\u2018Marriage And Birth Rates\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Transportation issued a memo directing federal transportation funds to communities with higher-than-average marriage and birth rates, effectively prioritizing conservative-leaning areas. The memo also requires funding recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, taking direct aim at sanctuary cities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The weaponization of federal funds to reward communities that align with MAGA policies\\u2014and punish those that don\\u2019t\\u2014marks an unprecedented politicization of the Department of Transportation\\u2019s grant programs. The directive will disproportionately impact diverse urban areas while favoring predominantly white, conservative states.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dot-memo-funds-communities-marriage-birth-rates_n_679bf8d8e4b0e1faebeef9c8\\\\\\\">HuffPost</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Kremlin-Style Presser Weaponized Tragedy and Blamed DEI </strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump lies and blamed the Biden administration\\u2019s DEI policies for a deadly plane crash over the Potomac River, despite admitting he had no evidence. He lied that the FAA was hiring air traffic controllers with severe disabilities under DEI initiatives, ignoring the fact that these programs began under his first term.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump exploited a national tragedy to push his anti-DEI agenda, spreading lies that diversity compromises safety. This propaganda tactic, common in Russia, distorts facts to justify a regime agenda while stoking division for political gain. Notably, he appointed a new FAA head today after firing the previous one last week.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/trump-dei-plane-crash-fact-check.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>USAID Official Placed on Leave for Refusing Illegal Firings</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The head of Employee and Labor Relations at USAID has been placed on administrative leave after refusing to execute illegally politically motivated firings ordered by Trump\\u2019s unauthorized Department of Government Efficiency and senior political appointees. The official reportedly resisted efforts to terminate career civil servants without legal justification, raising concerns about the legality of the purge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This escalates Trump\\u2019s authoritarian takeover of the federal government, using unauthorized DOGE to purge nonpartisan officials and replace them with loyalists. Targeting civil servants for upholding the law erodes institutional integrity, dismantles employee protections, and undermines the rule of law\\u2014hallmarks of autocratic regimes.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://x.com/dylanmatt/status/1885094358032011771\\\\\\\">Dylan Matthews (Vox) on X</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Paramount in Settlement Talks With Trump Over \\u201860 Minutes\\u2019 Lawsuit</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Paramount is negotiating a settlement with Trump over his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS for allegedly editing a \\u201C60 Minutes\\u201D interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing of the settlement talks has raised concerns, as Paramount is seeking FCC approval for a major merger with Skydance, and the agency is now led by a Trump appointee, Brendan Carr.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If Paramount concedes to Trump\\u2019s demands, it sets a dangerous precedent where media companies bow to political and legal pressure, eroding press freedom. This signals a new tactic for Trump to weaponize regulatory power against critical outlets. Following settlements from ABC News and Meta, CBS now faces similar pressure\\u2014sending a chilling message that media must comply or face consequences, mirroring state-controlled media tactics seen in authoritarian regimes.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/business/media/paramount-trump-cbs-news-settlement.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Pentagon scrubs Biden-era abortion travel policy</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Pentagon revoked a Biden-era policy that covered travel costs for service members and their dependents who needed to travel out of state for abortions or reproductive care. The move follows Trump's executive order enforcing the Hyde Amendment, effectively restricting access to reproductive healthcare for service members stationed in states with abortion bans.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This decision disproportionately impacts female service members, stripping them of bodily autonomy and restricting their healthcare options based on state laws they have no control over. It sends a clear message of gender inequality within the military and risks exacerbating recruitment and retention challenges, weakening overall military readiness.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5117934-pentagon-scrubs-biden-era-abortion-travel-policy/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Pentagon intelligence agency pauses observances for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has paused all observances of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, Holocaust Days of Remembrance, and other cultural or historical events following Trump's executive order banning DEI programs across federal agencies. The move affects 11 annual observances, including Black History Month, Women\\u2019s History Month, and Pride Month.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This erases recognition of marginalized communities and historical injustices, reinforcing Trump's broader effort to reshape federal institutions into ideological strongholds and rewrite history. By targeting cultural observances, the regime is further entrenching nationalism while dismantling diversity initiatives that promote inclusion and historical awareness.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><em><strong> <a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5117348-pentagon-halts-diversity-celebrations/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Native Americans say tribal members harassed by immigration agents</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Native American tribal members report harassment by ICE agents amid Trump's immigration crackdown. Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and Democratic lawmakers allege that ICE agents have stopped and questioned U.S. citizens based on their appearance, including a Mescalero Apache tribal member who was asked for proof of citizenship.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The targeting of Native Americans by federal immigration agents raises serious concerns about civil rights violations. Native Americans now feel compelled to carry additional documentation to prove their status, highlighting broader issues of discrimination and racial profiling.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/native-americans-say-tribal-members-harassed-by-immigration-agents-2025-01-30/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Rubio on buying Greenland: \\u2018This is not a joke\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Trump\\u2019s push to buy Greenland is serious, citing \\u2018national security\\u2019 concerns over China\\u2019s potential military expansion in the Arctic. Trump has argued that Denmark cannot defend Greenland and that the U.S. should take control of it. Denmark strongly rejected the proposal, with Greenlandic leaders reaffirming their sovereignty, and European leaders scrambling to devise a plan to protect Greenland against potential U.S. military action.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move signals an aggressive expansionist policy, risking diplomatic fallout with Denmark and NATO allies. While framed as a counter to Chinese influence, the push raises geopolitical tensions and questions about U.S. imperial ambitions in the Arctic. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5117893-marco-rubio-greenland-trump/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Google reclassifies U.S. as \\u2018sensitive country\\u2019 alongside China, Russia after Trump\\u2019s \\u2018Gulf of America\\u2019 comments</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Google reclassified the U.S. as a \\\\\\\"sensitive country\\\\\\\"\\u2014a label usually reserved for nations with authoritarian governments or territorial disputes\\u2014after Trump ordered the official renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the \\\\\\\"Gulf of America.\\\\\\\" The designation puts the U.S. alongside China, Russia, and Iraq in Google\\u2019s internal systems.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move signals growing instability and political interference in government mapping and tech regulation.
