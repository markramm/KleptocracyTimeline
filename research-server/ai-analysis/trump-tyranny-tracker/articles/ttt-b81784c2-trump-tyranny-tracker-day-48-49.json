  "content": "Demonstrators in Los Angeles on Saturday.Credit...Jen Osborne/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 8- 9: Weekend RoundupWelcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms. \ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsChinese investors privately take stakes in Elon Musk\u2019s companiesWhat Happened: Wealthy Chinese investors have secretly invested in Elon Musk\u2019s firms. They used special-purpose vehicles to avoid scrutiny. The investments targeted SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. Why It Matters: These companies work on sensitive technologies. SpaceX has U.S. government contracts, while xAI and Neuralink deal with artificial intelligence and neuroscience. The hidden investments raise national security concerns as Musk gains access to secret U.S. information and the sensitive personal data of all Americans. Chinese financial influence could lead to espionage, intellectual property theft, or backdoor access to critical U.S. technology.Source: Financial TimesTrump\u2019s Crypto Deregulation Poses \u2018Profound Risks\u2019\u2014ReportWhat Happened: A new report from the Center for Political Accountability warns of the dangers of Trump\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrency, highlighting unchecked corporate political spending, weakened regulations, and Trump\u2019s plan for a government-backed \u201ccrypto strategic reserve.\u201d Crypto firms spent over $134 million in the 2024 election and have seen lawsuits against them dropped since Trump took office.Why It Matters: With Trump eliminating regulatory oversight, crypto firms are gaining unprecedented influence over U.S. financial policy, fueling fears of corruption, financial instability, and investor manipulation. Source: The GuardianMusk\u2019s SpaceX Confirms Starlink Lease Agreement with FAAWhat Happened: SpaceX confirmed that it is providing Starlink satellite internet kits and services to the Federal Aviation Administration for free and \u201cdenied\u201d reports that it is attempting to take over Verizon\u2019s $2.4 billion contract to modernize the FAA\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. Why It Matters: This is blatant corruption, and this deal further expands Musk\u2019s influence over government infrastructure. By embedding Starlink into critical FAA systems, Musk is gaining leverage in national aviation safety and federal communications policy. Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Makes Aggressive New Claim of Executive Power To Circumvent The SenateWhat Happened: Trump asserted a new executive power, claiming the president can bypass the Senate\u2019s advice and consent role to appoint officials at independent agencies. In an email obtained by TPM, the White House justified installing Trump loyalist Pete Marocco as acting chairman of the U.S. African Development Foundation without Senate confirmation.Why It Matters: This allows Trump to bypass the Senate and install loyalists in powerful agencies like the SEC and NLRB with zero oversight. It\u2019s a direct assault on constitutional checks and balances, handing him unprecedented control over the federal government.Source: TPMWatchdogs fired by Trump raise alarms over future of independent government oversightWhat Happened: Trump fired the heads of multiple independent oversight agencies, including the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics, and 17 inspectors general. These watchdogs were responsible for investigating government corruption, whistleblower complaints, and ethical violations.Why It Matters: This authoritarian-style purge dismantles independent oversight, allowing Trump to operate without accountability. Watchdogs are critical in preventing abuses of power, and their removal paves the way for corruption, cover-ups, and retaliation against whistleblowers.Source: CBS NewsUS Weather Agency to Fire 1,000 in Second Round of CutsWhat Happened: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to lay off 1,029 employees, following a first round of 1,300 firings earlier this year. The cuts are part of Trump's plan to gut the federal workforce, reducing NOAA\u2019s headcount by 20%. Other agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, are also facing deep cuts, with 80,000 VA jobs set to be eliminated.Why It Matters: The NOAA cuts will weaken America\u2019s ability to forecast extreme weather and conduct climate research, putting lives at risk. Meanwhile, gutting the VA will devastate healthcare and services for veterans. Trump and Musk\u2019s aggressive dismantling of federal agencies mirrors authoritarian strategies\u2014where mass layoffs serve to weaken government functions and consolidate power.Source: ReutersPentagon Begins Mass Firings of Civilian EmployeesWhat Happened: The Department of Defense has placed thousands of probationary employees on administrative leave ahead of mass firings, with 5,400 terminations expected in the coming weeks. The Musk and Trump layoffs will be followed by a hiring freeze and a planned cut of 60,000 more civilian workers.Why It Matters: These mass firings endanger national security by slashing the Pentagon\u2019s civilian workforce, including veterans and skilled personnel in critical roles. Trump is bypassing legal challenges to continue the purge, using \u201cpoor\u201d performance lies as justification.Source: Defense OneDOGE Is the Deep StateWhat Happened: FAKE unauthorized DOGE has quietly taken over key government functions, bypassing Congress and consolidating power. Operating without transparency, DOGE has executed mass firings, overridden congressional funding, and embedded Musk loyalists across all federal agencies.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s fight against the \u201cdeep state\u201d has created an unelected shadowy power structure run by Musk, mirroring authoritarian regimes. FAKE DOGE is reshaping the government to serve corporate interests, undermining democratic oversight, and expanding Musk\u2019s control over policy\u2014 while granting dangerous access to America\u2019s secrets and sensitive information of all Americans.Source: WIREDTrump Justice Department Fires Head of Organized Crime Drug Task ForceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ fired Adam Cohen, the director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, just hours after he helped draft a memo redirecting the task force to focus on illegal immigration under \u201cOperation Take Back America.\u201d Additionally, three assistant U.S. attorneys, including two involved in the corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, were dismissed.Why It Matters: The purge of career officials within the Justice Department continues as Trump seizes control over the DOJ. The move also shifts federal law enforcement\u2019s focus from organized crime and drug trafficking to immigration enforcement.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDHS Uses Lie Detector Tests to Hunt \u201cLeakers\u201d Amid Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security has been administering polygraph tests to employees to identify those \u201cleaking\u201d information about ongoing immigration raids. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that two alleged \u201cleakers\u201d have been identified and will be prosecuted.Why It Matters: This crackdown on internal dissent mirrors authoritarian regimes, where mass purges and surveillance are used to silence whistleblowers. The use of lie detector tests raises concerns about intimidation tactics, the erosion of press freedom, and the broader implications for government accountability.Source: CBS NewsSBA Relocates Offices Out of \u2018Sanctuary Cities\u2019What Happened: The Small Business Administration announced it will move six regional offices from cities that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement\u2014Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City, and Seattle. SBA head Loeffler claims the relocation is \u201cnecessary\u201d to cut costs and ensure compliance with federal immigration laws. Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader retribution against blue states and sanctuary cities, and the politicization of the SBA will disrupt small business support in major economic hubs.Source: The HillLegal immigration agency employees asked to volunteer to help ICE operationsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime has asked U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees to volunteer for 60-day assignments assisting ICE in its mass deportation efforts. Why It Matters: This diverts federal resources from handling legal immigration applications, worsening delays for citizenship, green cards, and asylum requests. Despite being labeled as \"voluntary,\" employees will feel the need to volunteer under the threat of mass firings across all agencies.Source: CBS NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFear of Trump Has Elite Law Firms in RetreatWhat Happened: Trump signed executive orders stripping elite law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling of security clearances, government contracts, and federal building access. These firms have represented Democratic interests, including Special Counsel Jack Smith and the DNC. The move has created widespread fear among major law firms, many now reluctant to take cases against the regime.Why It Matters: This is a clear authoritarian tactic\u2014using government power to punish law firms for defending political opponents. By targeting firms that challenge his regime, Trump is undermining the legal system and chilling opposition litigation. Such attacks on independent legal representation are hallmarks of authoritarian regimes.Source: The Wall Street JournalCDC Asks Researchers to Align Studies with Trump\u2019s Ideological PrioritiesWhat Happened: The CDC sent a survey to federally funded researchers working abroad, asking whether their research aligns with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda, including combating \"Christian persecution,\" curbing illegal immigration, and opposing \"gender ideology extremism.\" Scientists were also asked whether their work involved diversity or climate change initiatives.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian move to inject politics into scientific research, forcing scientists to conform to Trump\u2019s ideological agenda instead of addressing urgent public health needs. Researchers fear the survey could be used to justify funding cuts, particularly for global health initiatives.Source: ABC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsU.S. Added to Global Watchlist for Declining Civic FreedomsWhat Happened: The U.S. has been placed on the Civicus Monitor Watchlist, joining countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan, due to Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on democratic norms. The watchdog cites mass federal firings, the appointment of Trump loyalists, withdrawal from global organizations, and suppression of protests as key reasons for the downgrade.Why It Matters: The U.S. is now internationally recognized as backsliding on civil liberties, marking an unprecedented shift for a country historically seen as a democracy champion. Trump\u2019s authoritarian policies are eroding constitutional freedoms and putting America on a fast track to a dictatorship.Source: The GuardianPanama Releases Detained U.S. Deportees into Legal LimboWhat Happened: Panama released dozens of migrants\u2014including asylum seekers\u2014who were held for weeks in a remote detention camp after being deported from the U.S. Many, now stranded without resources, were given 30 days to leave Panama. Why It Matters: This exports U.S. deportation processes to other countries, leaving vulnerable asylum seekers without legal recourse. Human rights groups warn that migrants face grave dangers if forced to return home. Source: NBC NewsWHO Warns of Tuberculosis Surge Due to USAID CutsWhat Happened: WHO warned that Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID tuberculosis programs are crippling global efforts to combat the disease, disrupting drug supplies, lab services, and surveillance in 18 high-risk countries. The rollback has already led to an estimated 3,400 additional TB deaths and 6,000 new infections. Experts warn that the U.S. could also see a resurgence.Why It Matters: Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide, and slashing USAID funding endangers millions while increasing risks of outbreaks in the U.S. Crippling infectious diseases programs will backfire on American public health.Source: NBC NewsICE Arrests Palestinian Activist Who Led Columbia ProtestsWhat Happened: ICE agents arrested Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil at his home, claiming his student visa and green card were revoked by a State Department order. His detention follows Trump\u2019s vow to deport foreign students and imprison \u201cagitators\u201d involved in protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.Why It Matters: This escalation is a crackdown on protestors. Today, it\u2019s pro-Palestinian activists\u2014tomorrow, any dissenters speaking out against Trump\u2019s regime. The regime\u2019s actions threaten free speech and due process, setting a dangerous precedent for political persecution.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchAtomic Detectives Who Inspect Iran Sites Affected by Trump\u2019s Aid FreezeWhat Happened: Trump suspended U.S. funding for two programs that assist the International Atomic Energy Agency in monitoring Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. One program was later restored, but the disruption weakened international efforts to track Iran\u2019s potential development of nuclear weapons.Why It Matters: The funding cuts undermine global nuclear nonproliferation efforts and reduce U.S. influence over monitoring Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Experts warn this could embolden Tehran while discouraging international collaboration on arms control.Source: New York TimesTrump Cuts Funding for National Fire Academy, Cancels TrainingWhat Happened: FEMA announced the immediate cancellation of all National Fire Academy classes due to federal funding freezes and staffing cuts under Trump. The decision disrupts essential training for firefighters, EMS providers, and first responders nationwide.Why It Matters: The NFA plays a critical role in preparing firefighters for disaster response, including combating deadly wildfires. Cutting its funding weakens national emergency preparedness and endangers first responders and the communities\u2014at a time when the threat from wildfires across America is at an all-time high. Source: CBS NewsScholars Stranded as State Department Freezes Funding for Fulbright, Other ProgramsWhat Happened: The U.S. State Department has frozen funding for critical international education programs, including Fulbright, Gilman, and Critical Language scholarships. Scholars abroad have stopped receiving payments, leaving many stranded without financial support.Why It Matters: The funding freeze threatens U.S. soft power and international diplomacy, cutting off vital educational exchanges. With no communication from officials, scholars face financial insecurity, and host institutions lose key educators. This further isolates the U.S. globally, leaving the door wide open for Russia and China.Source: Associated PressFederal Workers Face Mental Health Crisis Amid Trump Job CutsWhat Happened: As Trump slashes federal jobs, government employees\u2014many of them veterans\u2014are facing severe mental health distress. NBC News interviewed 20 federal workers who described experiencing panic attacks, weight loss, sleepless nights, and suicidal ideation. Some have visited emergency rooms after breakdowns, overwhelmed by uncertainty and hostility, including harassment on social media.Why It Matters: The regime\u2019s relentless demonization of federal workers\u2014paired with mass layoffs\u2014is causing a mental health crisis among those who have dedicated their lives to public service. Suicide prevention specialists, veterans, and other employees are now questioning their worth as Trump and Musk escalate their attacks. Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Policies Could Worsen Drug Trade Despite Anti-Fentanyl RhetoricWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, combined with deep federal funding cuts, could weaken efforts to stop fentanyl trafficking. Experts warn that these measures may backfire by undermining drug detection capabilities and border security. Programs like the UN Container Control Programme, which flags suspicious shipments, are already stalling due to funding cuts.Why It Matters: While Trump claims to be \u201ccracking down\u201d on fentanyl, his policies are stripping vital resources needed to combat drugs and could lead to an increase in drugs reaching the U.S.Source: The GuardianChaos at the V.A.: Inside the DOGE Cuts Disrupting the Veterans AgencyWhat Happened: Purges at the Department of Veterans Affairs have delayed critical clinical trials, canceled contracts, and led to mass firings of support staff. A hiring freeze has stalled a major cancer drug trial in Pittsburgh, leaving veterans without treatment options.Why It Matters: The cuts are severely disrupting medical care and research for 9.1 million veterans. The V.A. is now facing uncertainty, with deeper cuts looming. Source: New York TimesPentagon\u2019s Climate Program Cuts Could Undermine U.S. National SecurityWhat Happened: Musk and the Pentagon are eliminating climate-related programs, labeling them \"wasteful\" and outside the military\u2019s core mission. Officials and experts warn that the cuts will weaken military readiness, disrupt operations, and increase long-term costs from extreme weather damage to bases and infrastructure.Why It Matters: Military leaders and analysts argue that climate preparedness is essential for national security. Cutting climate resilience programs will leave troops vulnerable, disrupt operations, and weaken America\u2019s ability to counter adversaries.Source: CNNUtah to Become First State to Ban Fluoride in Public WaterWhat Happened: Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced he will sign a bill banning fluoride from public water systems, making Utah the first state to enact such a measure. Why It Matters: Fluoridation is one of the most effective public health measures for preventing tooth decay, particularly benefiting low-income communities with limited access to dental care. The move aligns with RFK\u2019s anti-science stance and the conspiracies he has spread.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchRubio and Musk Turn on Polish Foreign Minister in Fight Over Starlink Use in UkraineWhat Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk attacked Poland\u2019s Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski over Ukraine\u2019s use of Starlink. Musk implied he could turn off Starlink, a key system for Ukraine\u2019s military. Sikorski pushed back, noting Poland pays $50 million a year for the service and would seek alternatives if SpaceX became unreliable. Rubio escalated the fight, demanding Sikorski \"say thank you\" for U.S. aid.Why It Matters: The Trump regime\u2019s demand for public gratitude from allies is pure authoritarianism. Musk\u2019s threats to cut Ukraine off from Starlink show the dangerous power he holds over critical warzone infrastructure. Trump and Musk are using every chance to break alliances with key U.S. partners.Source: The Independent\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchU.S. Blocks Canada\u2019s Push to Crack Down on Russia\u2019s \u2018Shadow Fleet\u2019What Happened: The U.S. vetoed a Canadian proposal at the G7 to establish a task force targeting Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of oil tankers, which are used to bypass sanctions and fund its genocidal war in Ukraine. The U.S. also pushed to soften language on Russia\u2019s ability to \u201cmaintain its war\u201d by replacing it with \u201cearn revenue.\u201dWhy It Matters: While European allies seek to seize Russian tankers under international law, the U.S. is actively working to assist Russia.Source: The GuardianBritain urged to form breakaway 'Four Eyes' alliance without the US after Trump's 'unprecedented' decision to block intelligence sharing with UkraineWhat Happened: The U.K. is considering forming a breakaway \"Four Eyes\" intelligence-sharing alliance with Australia, Canada, and New Zealand\u2014excluding the U.S.\u2014after Trump blocked the sharing of U.S. intelligence with Ukraine. Trump's actions, which affect key allies in the Five Eyes alliance, have alarmed defense officials and resulted in hundreds of Ukrainian deaths.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s alignment with Russia is driving a wedge between the U.S. and its closest allies, jeopardizing NATO security. Intelligence officials fear Trump will leak or withhold critical info. Allies are now considering a Four Eyes alliance to bypass U.S. interference\u2014which would permanently reshape global security.Source: Daily MailPlan to Return Russian Diplomats to U.S. Poses Espionage RiskWhat Happened: Trump is negotiating the return of Russian diplomats to the United States, reversing years of expulsions due to espionage concerns. This is part of Trump\u2019s broader alignment with Russia.Why It Matters: Russia will seize this chance to flood the U.S. with spies, expanding its espionage network as it ramps up operations against the West. With Trump gutting counterintelligence efforts, the Kremlin stands to gain unchecked access.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s Affinity for Putin Grows More Consequential Than EverWhat Happened: Trump continues to align himself with Putin, dismissing past intelligence assessments that found Russia interfered in U.S. elections to help him win. His regime\u2019s foreign policy shifts\u2014including cutting military aid to Ukraine and assisting Moscow\u2014are benefiting the Kremlin.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s admiration for Putin now translates into tangible policy moves that weaken U.S. alliances, embolden Russia\u2019s global ambitions, and undermine democratic norms. Trump\u2019s desire for unchecked power mirrors Putin\u2019s authoritarian rule.Source: New York TimesDefiant Ukrainians Blame Trump for Battlefield Losses as Russia AdvancesWhat Happened: Ukrainians are outraged at Trump\u2019s decision to cut military aid and intelligence support, which they say has given Russia a major battlefield advantage. In the latest assaults, Russian forces used an abandoned oil pipeline to bypass Ukrainian defenses in Kursk, while elite airborne and marine units\u2014backed by North Korean soldiers\u2014launched frontal assaults under heavy artillery and drone cover. There is also a worry that Russia's sudden advantage in Kursk could be the result of receiving intel from the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s abandonment of Ukraine has left it defenseless, handing Russia the advantage to escalate attacks. His alignment with Putin is a betrayal, and as Russian offensives intensify, Trump\u2019s actions are fueling devastating losses and strengthening Moscow.Source: The Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsCompanies Warn Investors That Musk Cuts Could Hurt BusinessWhat Happened: As earnings season begins, multiple industries warn investors that Musk\u2019s cuts could negatively impact their businesses. Many federal contractors remain uncertain about which contracts will be slashed, while others fear disruptions to drug approvals and real estate demand due to mass federal layoffs.Why It Matters: The instability caused by Musk\u2019s chaotic gutting of the federal government is shaking markets and discouraging investment. Even companies that expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s \"business-friendly\" policies are now facing economic uncertainty. Such unpredictable government interference is characteristic of authoritarian regimes, where rapid policy changes destabilize private industries.Source: The Washington PostTrump Won\u2019t Rule Out Recession Amid Trade War ChaosWhat Happened: Trump refused to rule out a U.S. recession in 2025, acknowledging that his trade tariffs could fuel inflation. He downplayed stock market volatility triggered by his erratic tariff policies, claiming economic \"transition\" was necessary.Why It Matters: Trump's economic policies are destabilizing markets and risking a recession, contradicting his campaign promise, and his erratic approach to trade is fueling inflation fears.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsVeterans Nationwide March: March 14, 2025Thousands Gather to Oppose Trump on International Women\u2019s DayWhat Happened: About 300 demonstrations took place across the U.S. as thousands protested Trump\u2019s presidency, his handling of the war in Ukraine, attacks on reproductive rights, and mass firings of federal workers.

They allege that Martin, who previously defended January 6 defendants, dismissed charges against his former clients after taking office and failed to recuse himself, creating a clear conflict of interest. The complaint also accuses him of threatening government employees with prosecution to intimidate them.Source: The HillTribes and Native American Students Sue Over Bureau of Indian Education FiringsWhat Happened: Three tribal nations and five Native American students have sued Trump over mass firings at Bureau of Indian Education schools.

Happened:</strong><span> Wealthy Chinese investors have secretly invested in Elon Musk\u2019s firms. They used special-purpose vehicles to avoid scrutiny. The investments targeted SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. </span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> These companies work on sensitive technologies. SpaceX has U.S. government contracts, while xAI and Neuralink deal with artificial intelligence and neuroscience. The hidden investments raise national security concerns as Musk gains access to secret U.S. information and the sensitive personal data of all Americans.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 8- 9: Weekend Roundup</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms. </p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Chinese investors privately take stakes in Elon Musk\\u2019s companies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Wealthy Chinese investors have secretly invested in Elon Musk\\u2019s firms. They used special-purpose vehicles to avoid scrutiny. The investments targeted SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These companies work on sensitive technologies. SpaceX has U.S. government contracts, while xAI and Neuralink deal with artificial intelligence and neuroscience. The hidden investments raise national security concerns as Musk gains access to secret U.S. information and the sensitive personal data of all Americans. Chinese financial influence could lead to espionage, intellectual property theft, or backdoor access to critical U.S. technology.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.ft.com/content/66857e1e-a217-4ddd-8332-d9f0f75aa459\\\\\\\">Financial Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Crypto Deregulation Poses \\u2018Profound Risks\\u2019\\u2014Report</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A new report from the Center for Political Accountability warns of the dangers of Trump\\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrency, highlighting unchecked corporate political spending, weakened regulations, and Trump\\u2019s plan for a government-backed \\u201Ccrypto strategic reserve.\\u201D Crypto firms spent over $134 million in the 2024 election and have seen lawsuits against them dropped since Trump took office.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With Trump eliminating regulatory oversight, crypto firms are gaining unprecedented influence over U.S. financial policy, fueling fears of corruption, financial instability, and investor manipulation. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/crypto-deregulation-trump\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s SpaceX Confirms Starlink Lease Agreement with FAA</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> SpaceX confirmed that it is providing Starlink satellite internet kits and services to the Federal Aviation Administration for free and \\u201Cdenied\\u201D reports that it is attempting to take over Verizon\\u2019s $2.4 billion contract to modernize the FAA\\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is blatant corruption, and this deal further expands Musk\\u2019s influence over government infrastructure. By embedding Starlink into critical FAA systems, Musk is gaining leverage in national aviation safety and federal communications policy. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5182848-musks-spacex-confirms-starlink-lease-agreement-with-faa/?tbref=hp\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Makes Aggressive New Claim of Executive Power To Circumvent The Senate</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump asserted a new executive power, claiming the president can bypass the Senate\\u2019s advice and consent role to appoint officials at independent agencies. In an email obtained by TPM, the White House justified installing Trump loyalist Pete Marocco as acting chairman of the U.S. African Development Foundation without Senate confirmation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This allows Trump to bypass the Senate and install loyalists in powerful agencies like the SEC and NLRB with zero oversight. It\\u2019s a direct assault on constitutional checks and balances, handing him unprecedented control over the federal government.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/exclusive-trump-makes-aggressive-new-claim-of-executive-power-to-circumvent-the-senate\\\\\\\">TPM</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Watchdogs fired by Trump raise alarms over future of independent government oversight</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired the heads of multiple independent oversight agencies, including the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics, and 17 inspectors general. These watchdogs were responsible for investigating government corruption, whistleblower complaints, and ethical violations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This authoritarian-style purge dismantles independent oversight, allowing Trump to operate without accountability. Watchdogs are critical in preventing abuses of power, and their removal paves the way for corruption, cover-ups, and retaliation against whistleblowers.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-firings-watchdogs-inspectors-general-60-minutes/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>US Weather Agency to Fire 1,000 in Second Round of Cuts</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to lay off 1,029 employees, following a first round of 1,300 firings earlier this year. The cuts are part of Trump's plan to gut the federal workforce, reducing NOAA\\u2019s headcount by 20%. Other agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, are also facing deep cuts, with 80,000 VA jobs set to be eliminated.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The NOAA cuts will weaken America\\u2019s ability to forecast extreme weather and conduct climate research, putting lives at risk. Meanwhile, gutting the VA will devastate healthcare and services for veterans. Trump and Musk\\u2019s aggressive dismantling of federal agencies mirrors authoritarian strategies\\u2014where mass layoffs serve to weaken government functions and consolidate power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/memo-says-mass-layoffs-veterans-affairs-will-begin-early-june-2025-03-09/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Pentagon Begins Mass Firings of Civilian Employees</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Defense has placed thousands of probationary employees on administrative leave ahead of mass firings, with 5,400 terminations expected in the coming weeks. The Musk and Trump layoffs will be followed by a hiring freeze and a planned cut of 60,000 more civilian workers.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These mass firings endanger national security by slashing the Pentagon\\u2019s civilian workforce, including veterans and skilled personnel in critical roles. Trump is bypassing legal challenges to continue the purge, using \\u201Cpoor\\u201D performance lies as justification.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2025/03/pentagon-placing-probationary-employees-admin-leave-preparation-mass-firings/403566/?oref=d1-featured-river-top\\\\\\\">Defense One</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOGE Is the Deep State</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FAKE unauthorized DOGE has quietly taken over key government functions, bypassing Congress and consolidating power. Operating without transparency, DOGE has executed mass firings, overridden congressional funding, and embedded Musk loyalists across all federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s fight against the \\u201Cdeep state\\u201D has created an unelected shadowy power structure run by Musk, mirroring authoritarian regimes. FAKE DOGE is reshaping the government to serve corporate interests, undermining democratic oversight, and expanding Musk\\u2019s control over policy\\u2014 while granting dangerous access to America\\u2019s secrets and sensitive information of all Americans.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-is-the-deep-state/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Justice Department Fires Head of Organized Crime Drug Task Force</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s DOJ fired Adam Cohen, the director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, just hours after he helped draft a memo redirecting the task force to focus on illegal immigration under \\u201COperation Take Back America.\\u201D Additionally, three assistant U.S. attorneys, including two involved in the corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, were dismissed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The purge of career officials within the Justice Department continues as Trump seizes control over the DOJ.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that two alleged \\u201Cleakers\\u201D have been identified and will be prosecuted.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This crackdown on internal dissent mirrors authoritarian regimes, where mass purges and surveillance are used to silence whistleblowers.

SBA head Loeffler claims the relocation is \\u201Cnecessary\\u201D to cut costs and ensure compliance with federal immigration laws. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of Trump\\u2019s broader retribution against blue states and sanctuary cities, and the politicization of the SBA will disrupt small business support in major economic hubs.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/business/5183413-loeffler-small-business-administration-offices-sanctuary-city/?tbref=hp\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Legal immigration agency employees asked to volunteer to help ICE operations</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s regime has asked U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees to volunteer for 60-day assignments assisting ICE in its mass deportation efforts. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This diverts federal resources from handling legal immigration applications, worsening delays for citizenship, green cards, and asylum requests. Despite being labeled as \\\\\\\"voluntary,\\\\\\\" employees will feel the need to volunteer under the threat of mass firings across all agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-immigration-agency-employees-asked-volunteer-help-ice-operations/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3>Fear of Trump Has Elite Law Firms in Retreat</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed executive orders stripping elite law firms Perkins Coie and Covington &amp; Burling of security clearances, government contracts, and federal building access. These firms have represented Democratic interests, including Special Counsel Jack Smith and the DNC. The move has created widespread fear among major law firms, many now reluctant to take cases against the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a clear authoritarian tactic\\u2014using government power to punish law firms for defending political opponents. By targeting firms that challenge his regime, Trump is undermining the legal system and chilling opposition litigation. Such attacks on independent legal representation are hallmarks of authoritarian regimes.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/fear-of-trump-has-elite-law-firms-in-retreat-6f251dec\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>CDC Asks Researchers to Align Studies with Trump\\u2019s Ideological Priorities</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The CDC sent a survey to federally funded researchers working abroad, asking whether their research aligns with Trump\\u2019s extremist agenda, including combating \\\\\\\"Christian persecution,\\\\\\\" curbing illegal immigration, and opposing \\\\\\\"gender ideology extremism.\\\\\\\" Scientists were also asked whether their work involved diversity or climate change initiatives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian move to inject politics into scientific research, forcing scientists to conform to Trump\\u2019s ideological agenda instead of addressing urgent public health needs.

The watchdog cites mass federal firings, the appointment of Trump loyalists, withdrawal from global organizations, and suppression of protests as key reasons for the downgrade.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The U.S. is now internationally recognized as backsliding on civil liberties, marking an unprecedented shift for a country historically seen as a democracy champion.

The rollback has already led to an estimated 3,400 additional TB deaths and 6,000 new infections. Experts warn that the U.S. could also see a resurgence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide, and slashing USAID funding endangers millions while increasing risks of outbreaks in the U.S. Crippling infectious diseases programs will backfire on American public health.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/tuberculosis-surge-possible-usaid-cuts-trump-who-rcna195190\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>ICE Arrests Palestinian Activist Who Led Columbia Protests</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE agents arrested Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil at his home, claiming his student visa and green card were revoked by a State Department order.

One program was later restored, but the disruption weakened international efforts to track Iran\\u2019s potential development of nuclear weapons.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The funding cuts undermine global nuclear nonproliferation efforts and reduce U.S. influence over monitoring Iran\\u2019s nuclear program.

The decision disrupts essential training for firefighters, EMS providers, and first responders nationwide.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The NFA plays a critical role in preparing firefighters for disaster response, including combating deadly wildfires. Cutting its funding weakens national emergency preparedness and endangers first responders and the communities\\u2014at a time when the threat from wildfires across America is at an all-time high. </p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fema-national-fire-academy-cources-cancellation/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Scholars Stranded as State Department Freezes Funding for Fulbright, Other Programs</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. State Department has frozen funding for critical international education programs, including Fulbright, Gilman, and Critical Language scholarships. Scholars abroad have stopped receiving payments, leaving many stranded without financial support.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The funding freeze threatens U.S. soft power and international diplomacy, cutting off vital educational exchanges. With no communication from officials, scholars face financial insecurity, and host institutions lose key educators. This further isolates the U.S. globally, leaving the door wide open for Russia and China.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/fulbright-scholars-stipends-frozen-indefinitely-9da042b5e0bda70fb1c76105564c71f4\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Federal Workers Face Mental Health Crisis Amid Trump Job Cuts</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As Trump slashes federal jobs, government employees\\u2014many of them veterans\\u2014are facing severe mental health distress. NBC News interviewed 20 federal workers who described experiencing panic attacks, weight loss, sleepless nights, and suicidal ideation. Some have visited emergency rooms after breakdowns, overwhelmed by uncertainty and hostility, including harassment on social media.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The regime\\u2019s relentless demonization of federal workers\\u2014paired with mass layoffs\\u2014is causing a mental health crisis among those who have dedicated their lives to public service.

Experts warn that these measures may backfire by undermining drug detection capabilities and border security. Programs like the UN Container Control Programme, which flags suspicious shipments, are already stalling due to funding cuts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While Trump claims to be \\u201Ccracking down\\u201D on fentanyl, his policies are stripping vital resources needed to combat drugs and could lead to an increase in drugs reaching the U.S.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/trump-policies-drug-trade-fentanyl\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Chaos at the V.A.: Inside the DOGE Cuts Disrupting the Veterans Agency</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Purges at the Department of Veterans Affairs have delayed critical clinical trials, canceled contracts, and led to mass firings of support staff.

Officials and experts warn that the cuts will weaken military readiness, disrupt operations, and increase long-term costs from extreme weather damage to bases and infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Military leaders and analysts argue that climate preparedness is essential for national security.

Musk implied he could turn off Starlink, a key system for Ukraine\\u2019s military. Sikorski pushed back, noting Poland pays $50 million a year for the service and would seek alternatives if SpaceX became unreliable. Rubio escalated the fight, demanding Sikorski \\\\\\\"say thank you\\\\\\\" for U.S. aid.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Trump regime\\u2019s demand for public gratitude from allies is pure authoritarianism.
