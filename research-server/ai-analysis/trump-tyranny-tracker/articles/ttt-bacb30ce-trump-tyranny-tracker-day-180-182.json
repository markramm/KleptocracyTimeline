Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 18-20Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 9Google Meet: July 29, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump offers regulatory relief for coal, iron ore and chemical industriesWhat Happened: Trump granted a two-year rollback of environmental rules for coal plants, iron ore processors, and chemical manufacturers, overriding Biden-era EPA standards. He framed the move as \u201cnecessary\u201d for national security.Why It Matters: This is another massive handout to polluters. Trump is gutting clean air protections, risking tens of thousands of lives to reward corporate allies and donors\u2014while branding it \u201cnational security.\u201d Environmental watchdogs call it a \u201cfree pass\u201d to poison the public.Source: Associated PressFor Sale: Trump is leveraging power of his office to reap profits for family businessesWhat Happened: Trump is using his presidency to rake in billions through crypto coins, foreign-backed deals, and branded merchandise, enriching his family\u2019s businesses while gutting oversight. The Trump Organization is profiting from global investments, a $2 billion UAE-backed stablecoin, and insider-friendly regulation.Why It Matters: This is kleptocracy in broad daylight. Trump is auctioning off American policy to the highest bidder, turning the White House into a global pay-to-play scheme with zero accountability. Source: Associated PressInvestors cheer new crypto law while critics warn of potential for crisisWhat Happened: Trump signed the GENIUS Act, legalizing private stablecoins and triggering a crypto boom. Bitcoin hit record highs as Trump-linked World Liberty Financial stood to gain big.Why It Matters: This is legalized self-dealing. Trump is enriching his family while paving the way for an unregulated shadow banking system that could trigger another financial crisis.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsWith gavel in hand, Trump chisels away at the power of a compliant CongressWhat Happened: Trump signed the tax cut and spending bill on July 4, banging a gavel gifted by Speaker Mike Johnson. The bill extends Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and slashes $1.2 trillion from Medicaid, food stamps, and other services\u2014just as Congress shelved its own sanctions bill at Trump\u2019s request.Why It Matters: Congress continues to be a rubber stamp. GOP leaders have surrendered their power, turning the legislature into a tool of Trump\u2019s will. This is how autocracy takes hold\u2014just like in Russia, where parliament exists to obey, not check, the executive.Source: Associated PressThe USDA wants states to hand over food stamp data by the end of JulyWhat Happened: The USDA ordered all states to submit detailed personal data on SNAP recipients by July 30, including names, Social Security numbers, and benefits received. Lawsuits argue it violates privacy laws and could fuel Trump\u2019s mass deportation efforts.Why It Matters: This is another major expansion of Trump\u2019s surveillance state. By turning safety net programs into intelligence tools, the regime is eroding privacy. The USDA is no longer feeding the hungry\u2014it\u2019s feeding the deportation machine.

Dick Durbin exposed that 1,000 FBI personnel were ordered to flag any Epstein case files mentioning Trump. A protected FBI whistleblower told Durbin\u2019s office the directive came during a mass deployment to mine Epstein-related records. Durbin is demanding answers from DOJ leaders, citing political interference, suppression of evidence, and an apparent effort to shield Trump from scrutiny.Why It Matters: This is a massive cover-up. Trump officials are weaponizing the FBI to shield him from ties to a convicted sex trafficker. It\u2019s political interference, obstruction of justice, and a blatant abuse of federal power to bury the truth.Source: NBC NewsJustice Department requests lists of undocumented immigrants in LA County jailsWhat Happened: The Justice Department is demanding that LA County hand over names, charges, and release dates of undocumented inmates. Sheriff Robert Luna says the feds threatened him with prosecution if he doesn\u2019t comply, but California sanctuary laws prohibit such cooperation without warrants.Why It Matters: Another direct federal assault on local sanctuary protections. By coercing local law enforcement and tapping into Medicaid data, Trump\u2019s regime is escalating its war on immigrants\u2014turning civil agencies into tools of mass deportation.Source: CBS NewsRepublican National Committee sues New Jersey over records on voter roll maintenanceWhat Happened: The Republican National Committee sued New Jersey for refusing to release documents on voter roll maintenance and voting machine audit logs, part of a broader Trump effort to scrutinize election systems.Why It Matters: This is more election denialism repackaged as \u201coversight.\u201d By suing for sensitive voting records, the RNC is laying the groundwork to challenge future results and undermine trust in Democratic-leaning states ahead of 2026.Source: ReutersTrump threatens Washington stadium deal unless NFL team readopts Redskins nameWhat Happened: Trump said he may block the Washington Commanders' new stadium deal unless the team reverts to its former name, the Redskins\u2014a term long condemned as a racist slur. He claimed the current name is \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggested federal intervention.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to push racist nostalgia and distract from the Epstein scandal. This threat is a cultural weapon in his war on progress, targeting Indigenous rights and hijacking federal deals to force ideological compliance.Source: ReutersState Dept. Official Says Criticism of Israel Can Lead to Visa RevocationsWhat Happened: A top State Department official testified that the Trump regime weighs criticism of Israel when deciding whether to deny or revoke student visas. He acknowledged there's no formal antisemitism definition guiding these decisions and confirmed that comments like \u201cdenouncing Zionism\u201d could prompt action.Why It Matters: The government is punishing lawful residents and foreign students for political speech\u2014crossing a line into First Amendment violations and creating a chilling effect on dissent in academia.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Says Schiff Should See Jail Time for Alleged \u201cMortgage Fraud\u201dWhat Happened: Trump escalated attacks on Sen.

His Truth Social post came amid a reported Fannie Mae investigation into Schiff, though no charges have been filed.Why It Matters: Trump is spewing baseless accusations and weaponizing investigations to punish a political enemy who exposed his corruption, insurrection, and Kremlin ties.

She called for prosecutions and released documents suggesting Obama officials \u201cfaked intelligence.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is straight out of an authoritarian playbook\u2014criminalizing political opposition and rewriting history to erase Russia\u2019s election attack that assisted Trump.

The decision comes just days after Colbert criticized a $16 million Trump-Paramount settlement tied to a pending media merger that requires Trump\u2019s approval. Why It Matters: Colbert has been one of Trump\u2019s sharpest and most consistent critics. His cancellation strips late-night TV of a powerful dissenting voice, raising fears of political retaliation and censorship as Trump tightens control over media institutions.Source: Associated PressTrump claims Epstein files are faked, but many documents have been public for yearsWhat Happened: Trump lied that Biden officials doctored Epstein files, calling them \u201cfake.\u201d But key documents\u2014including flight logs, contact books, and civil court filings\u2014have been public for years, most unsealed between 2019 and 2024.Why It Matters: Trump is deflecting with baseless lies to dodge renewed scrutiny over his decades-long Epstein ties.

The move is part of Trump\u2019s plan to expand detention capacity from 60,000 to 100,000 beds.Why It Matters: Trump continues militarizing immigration enforcement. Detaining civilians on military bases blurs the line between national defense and domestic policing\u2014fueling fear, overreach, and the normalization of internment and military operations on U.S. soil.Source: Associated PressParamount bidder Skydance plays patriotism card in push for deal OKWhat Happened: Skydance CEO David Ellison pitched the Paramount takeover to the FCC as a patriotic move, vowing CBS would reflect \u201cvaried perspectives.\u201d He downplayed Tencent ties and defended a $16 million Trump settlement over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d episode.Why It Matters: With Trump allies seizing control, editorial independence is vanishing\u2014and CBS is already being purged to align with the regime.Source: NBC NewsTrump Aides Discussed Ending Some SpaceX Contracts, but Found Most Were VitalWhat Happened: After Musk publicly criticized Trump, the regime reviewed SpaceX\u2019s federal contracts. Despite Trump\u2019s call to cut ties, officials found most of SpaceX\u2019s deals with NASA and the Pentagon were too critical to cancel. Aides admitted the government remains heavily dependent on Musk\u2019s rocket and satellite tech.Why It Matters: Even amid political fallout, Musk\u2019s hold on U.S. space infrastructure is too strong to break, a major problem in itself.

Despite identifying himself, he was injured, held without charges for three days, denied medical care, and missed his daughter\u2019s third birthday as his family frantically searched for him.Why It Matters: This case reaffirms the brutality of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, where even U.S. citizens are violently swept up. Retes\u2019 unlawful detention, physical abuse, and lack of due process reflect a lawless system fueled by racial profiling and authoritarian tactics, eroding constitutional protections for all Americans.Source: CNNTrump administration ends 988 Lifeline's special service for LGBTQ+ young peopleWhat Happened: After the removal of the dedicated LGBTQ+ option on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, the Trevor Project assured that its crisis services remain fully available via phone, text, and online chat.Why It Matters: As the federal crisis system sidelines LGBTQ+ support, the Trevor Project is stepping up to fill the gap\u2014ensuring people in crisis still have access to affirming, lifesaving care in a time of escalating attacks.Source: NPRHe Came to the U.S. to Support His Sick Child.

It\u2019s the hallmark of a lawless regime using fear and brutality to enforce its will.Source: ProPublicaIce secretly deported Pennsylvania grandfather, 82, after he lost green cardWhat Happened: Luis Leon, a legal U.S. resident since 1987, was secretly disappeared after visiting ICE to replace a lost green card. His family was falsely told he died, only to find him later hospitalized in Guatemala, a country he had no ties to.Why It Matters: This is more state-sponsored cruelty.

Known for exposing immigration raids, Guevara was shuffled through five jails and faces deportation.Why It Matters: The Trump regime is targeting journalists\u2014especially immigrants\u2014who expose its abuses.

Legal experts say it\u2019s a major rollback with global implications and contradicts decades of evolving U.S. asylum norms.Source: Mother JonesCivil rights work is slowing as Trump dismantles the Education Department, agency data showsWhat Happened: Civil rights case resolutions at the Education Department have plummeted under Trump, despite rising complaints. Half of the Office for Civil Rights staff was purged, and the backlog has surged past 25,000 cases.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling the agency tasked with protecting children\u2019s rights, turning civil rights enforcement into a hollow shell while outsourcing justice to overloaded courts and leaving parents with nowhere to turn.Source: Associated PressHigh-ranking Democrats press Trump administration on US deal with El Salvador to detain migrantsWhat Happened: 4 senior House Democrats demanded answers from Kristi Noem and Marco Rubio about a secret deal that disappeared over 200 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador\u2019s gulag. El Salvador told the UN the detainees remain under U.S. legal responsibility\u2014contradicting claims from Trump officials.Why It Matters: Congress is now probing whether the DOJ lied to the courts to conceal a covert extrajudicial detention scheme. The Trump regime outsourced imprisonment to an authoritarian ally\u2014bypassing due process, dodging U.S. courts, and violating international law.Source: ABC NewsICE head says agents will arrest anyone found in the U.S. illegally, crack down on employers of unauthorized workersWhat Happened: ICE director Todd Lyons said agents will arrest anyone found living in the U.S. illegally\u2014criminal record or not\u2014and crack down on employers hiring them. Backed by billions in new Trump funding, ICE aims for 1 million deportations this year and has resumed aggressive workplace raids.Why It Matters: Trump has fully dismantled Biden-era protections, unleashing a dragnet immigration regime that criminalizes survival and tears apart communities. Mass arrests and worksite raids result in economic disruption, civil rights violations, and humanitarian abuse.Source: CBS NewsTrump Administration Prepares to Drop Seven Major Housing Discrimination CasesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s HUD is closing 7 major fair housing cases, despite past findings of discrimination in cities like Chicago and Memphis.

A new lawsuit alleges detainees are denied food, showers, medical care, and legal access.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation regime is expanding into Puerto Rico, eroding due process, and turning detention on U.S. soil into de facto internment camps.

He replaced vaccine experts with anti-vaxxers and canceled key scientific meetings.Why It Matters: By gutting science-based policymaking and pushing conspiracy-laced ideology, Kennedy and Trump are endangering Americans\u2019 health and crippling the nation\u2019s ability to respond to disease outbreaks.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Immigration Crackdown Hits Senior Care Work ForceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s move to end deportation protections for migrants with temporary legal status is hitting nursing homes and home care agencies hard. Providers are terminating staff and warning of closures, rising costs, and declining care as immigrant workers\u2014who make up nearly a third of the sector\u2014disappear.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda is sabotaging elder care nationwide, destabilizing a system already stretched thin.

The move aligns with Trump\u2019s broader effort to dismantle environmental regulation.Why It Matters: By firing experts and gutting research, Trump is crippling the EPA\u2019s ability to protect public health\u2014just as climate and pollution threats intensify. It\u2019s a gift to polluters at the expense of the people.Source: ReutersCongressional forecaster says Trump health research cuts would lead to fewer new drugsWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office warned that Trump\u2019s proposed 40% cut to the NIH would slash drug development, eventually reducing new treatments by 4.5%. Delays at a gutted FDA would worsen the decline.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s war on science is sabotaging the future of medicine. Slashing research now means fewer cures later, resulting in a long-term decline in public health.Source: ReutersSenior Hegseth adviser out at Pentagon, sources sayWhat Happened: Justin Fulcher, a top Pentagon aide and former DOGE operative, has been quietly removed from his post advising Pete Hegseth. His departure follows a series of dismissals tied to the Signalgate leak that involved sensitive U.S. military plans.Why It Matters: The dismissal exposes more chaos and turmoil inside the Pentagon, where loyalty tests are endangering national security.

Trump officials say the plan is \u201cillegal\u201d and is replacing it with new repayment models.Why It Matters: This will force hundreds of thousands into higher monthly payments and could disqualify time spent in forbearance from counting toward loan forgiveness.

Some stores may shut down, forcing residents to travel 30+ miles for groceries.Why It Matters: SNAP recipients are a lifeline for small-town grocers, and the GOP\u2019s cuts will trigger mass layoffs, reduce food access, and force economic decline in the very communities Trump claims to champion.Source: Politico\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchMillions of travelers to the U.S. could be charged a new $250 \"visa integrity fee\"What Happened: A new Trump-backed law will charge a $250 \"visa integrity fee\" on nonimmigrant U.S. visa holders, including foreign students and skilled workers.
