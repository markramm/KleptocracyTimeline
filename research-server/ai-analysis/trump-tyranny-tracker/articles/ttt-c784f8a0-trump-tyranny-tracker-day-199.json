Some lost contracts and clearances, while others cut deals to provide pro-Trump legal services in exchange for protection.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing fear to gut legal opposition, leaving civil rights groups, whistleblowers, and even FBI agents without top-tier representation\u2014letting abuses go unchecked.Source: ProPublica\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsStandoff at ICE Facility Leaves Democrats \u2018Trapped\u2019 for Half an HourWhat Happened: Reps. Adriano Espaillat, Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, and Dan Goldman were blocked from entering the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center, where ICE is holding over 100 immigrants. Agents locked the gates and vanished for 20 minutes, effectively trapping the lawmakers inside the facility\u2019s perimeter.Why It Matters: ICE continues shutting out congressional oversight. The incident reflects an alarming level of impunity, disregard for lawmakers, and signals how Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is bypassing all democratic checks.Source: NOTUSTulsi Gabbard declassified documents over CIA objections, sources sayWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard declassified a 2016 Russia interference report over CIA objections, exposing raw intel, source details, and intercept dates that could jeopardize human assets. Critics say it\u2019s one of the most recklessly unredacted disclosures ever, revealing Putin\u2019s preferences and covert U.S. spying capabilities.Why It Matters: Gabbard\u2019s move hands Russia a roadmap to identify U.S. sources and methods, putting lives at risk to serve Trump\u2019s conspiracy narrative. It\u2019s a politicized breach of national security that weakens American intelligence defenses.Source: NBC NewsCongress doesn't want to talk to Alex Acosta, Epstein's 'sweetheart deal' makerWhat Happened: The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to 10 high-profile figures tied to the Jeffrey Epstein case\u2014but excluded Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who brokered Epstein\u2019s infamous non-prosecution deal. Victims\u2019 lawyers condemned the omission, calling it a glaring gap in any serious investigation.Why It Matters: Acosta played a key role in letting Epstein off the hook and granting immunity to his co-conspirators. Leaving him out exposes this as political shielding, undermining any claim that Congress\u2019s investigation is legitimate.Source: NBC NewsPlanned dinner for Trump officials to discuss Epstein appears to have been moved amid media scrutinyWhat Happened: A planned dinner at JD Vance\u2019s residence to coordinate Trump officials\u2019 messaging on the Epstein scandal was abruptly moved or canceled after CNN reported on it. The gathering was intended to mend tensions between Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, and Dan Bongino, who have clashed over the DOJ\u2019s handling of Epstein-related files.Why It Matters: The Trump team has been in disarray over the Epstein cover-up, with internal feuds, media leaks, and political damage control replacing transparency. The canceled dinner exposes their scramble to control the narrative while hiding key facts to protect Trump.Source: CNN\u2018This is sending a message\u2019: DOJ moves to sanction lawyer who took pro bono deportation caseWhat Happened: The Justice Department, following Trump\u2019s directive to penalize \u201cfrivolous\u201d litigation, is seeking sanctions against Joshua Schroeder, a California attorney who took on a pro bono deportation case involving a Laotian immigrant. Schroeder briefly halted the deportation but ultimately lost\u2014and now faces DOJ accusations of bad-faith filings and \u201cmisuse\u201d of the Alien Enemies Act in court.Why It Matters: The regime is weaponizing sanctions to intimidate immigration lawyers and deter legal challenges, even against those providing free representation. It\u2019s a chilling message that defending the vulnerable can now come with personal risk.Source: PoliticoStanford Newspaper Challenges Legal Basis for Student DeportationsWhat Happened: A new lawsuit challenges Trump\u2019s use of an obscure immigration law to arrest and deport foreign students for pro-Palestinian speech. Filed by a First Amendment watchdog on behalf of The Stanford Daily, the suit argues that applying the \u201cforeign policy threat\u201d clause to lawful noncitizens\u2019 political expression is unconstitutional.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown turns protected speech into a deportable offense, targeting noncitizens for dissent. This test case could define whether the First Amendment protects immigrants from ideological purges driven by Trump\u2019s foreign alliances.Source: New York TimesICE Is Buying Mobile Iris Scanning Tech for Its Deportation ArmWhat Happened: ICE plans to acquire iris-scanning tools from BI2 Technologies, including the Mobile Offender Recognition & Identification System and I.R.I.S., a national biometric database. Originally designed for sheriffs to identify inmates, the tech will now be used by ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations to identify and track deportation targets \u201cin seconds from virtually anywhere.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a dangerous escalation toward a biometric surveillance state. Trump is weaponizing jail tech to hunt immigrants nationwide\u2014using them as the test case before rolling these tactics out on everyone.Source: 404 MediaPaxton launches investigation into Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s political group for funding Democrats who left stateWhat Happened: Texas AG Ken Paxton launched an investigation into Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s group, Powered by People, accusing it of orchestrating an \u201cinfluence scheme\u201d by funding travel and fines for Democrats who fled the state to block a GOP redistricting plan.Why It Matters: This is political retaliation\u2014Trump-aligned officials weaponizing state power to punish Democrats for resisting a rigged map and targeting Beto as a threat to their scheme.Source: Texas TribuneTexas Gov. Abbott claims FBI is going to search for Texas House DemocratsWhat Happened: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott claimed the FBI might assist in locating and returning Democratic state lawmakers who fled to block an outrageous GOP redistricting plan. He\u2019s also petitioning the Texas Supreme Court to remove Rep. Gene Wu from office and threatening arrest for any Democrat returning to Texas.Why It Matters: Trump-aligned officials are criminalizing dissent and turning law enforcement into a political weapon. Threatening lawmakers with FBI searches, arrests, and removal for opposing a gerrymander is a dangerous escalation and abuse of power.Source: ABC NewsTrump administration plans $64 million cut to New York City security fundingWhat Happened: Trump is cutting $64 million from New York City\u2019s counterterrorism budget, just weeks after a deadly mass shooting in Manhattan. FEMA claims the decision was based on past unspent funds and a new risk assessment.Why It Matters: Slashing security funds from the top terrorism target in the U.S.\u2014weeks after an attack\u2014underscores reckless disregard for public safety. Trump\u2019s punitive cuts endanger millions, undermine national security readiness, and continue his pattern of targeting blue cities for political retribution.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsConstitution Sections on Due Process and Foreign Gifts Vanish from Congress WebsiteWhat Happened: Key parts of Article I\u2014including bans on foreign gifts to officials and guarantees of habeas corpus\u2014briefly disappeared from Congress\u2019s official Constitution page. Sections 9 and 10 were missing until users flagged the change; the Library of Congress later called it a \u201ctechnical error\u201d and restored them.Why It Matters: These aren't trivial omissions and cover core protections against abuse of power and corruption. Whether deliberate or not, their sudden removal fuels distrust, especially under a regime already accused of undermining constitutional norms.Source: 404 MediaTexas Democrats staying in Illinois evacuated over bomb threatWhat Happened: A bomb threat forced the evacuation of Texas House Democrats staying at an Illinois hotel after fleeing their state to block a GOP redistricting plan. No device was found, but lawmakers say the threat follows escalating rhetoric from Texas officials calling to \u201chunt\u201d them down.Why It Matters: The Trump-aligned Texas GOP is pushing redistricting by any means\u2014including threats, lawsuits, and now a bomb scare. This is what political warfare looks like in today\u2019s America.Source: ABC NewsVoice of America director says Trump officials are illegally ousting himWhat Happened: VOA Director Michael Abramowitz filed suit alleging Trump officials are unlawfully removing him, as Kari Lake, overseeing the agency, purges staff and pushes far-right content. A judge warned Lake may be violating a court order protecting VOA\u2019s independence as its workforce drops from 1,300 to 72 and services in 45 languages are cut.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s team is gutting a key U.S. public diplomacy tool, replacing independent journalism with propaganda. Lake\u2019s defiance of federal law and court orders shows open contempt for the rule of law in the regime\u2019s war on press freedom.Source: NPRUCLA says Trump administration has suspended $584 million in grantsWhat Happened: Trump suspended $584 million in federal research grants to UCLA, citing civil rights \"violations against Jewish and Israeli students. The move follows a DOJ finding that UCLA failed to address campus antisemitism and comes after a $6 million settlement with students and faculty.Why It Matters: Trump is ramping up financial assault on public universities, weaponizing federal funding to impose ideological conformity. Experts warn this will cripple innovation, undermine national security, and stall lifesaving scientific research.Source: NBC NewsTrump Is Launching an AI Search Engine Powered by PerplexityWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s media company has partnered with Perplexity to launch an AI-powered search engine on Truth Social. The move brings a controversial, plagiarism-accused AI firm into the Trump tech ecosystem, despite Perplexity\u2019s history of using undeclared scrapers and stealing content from major news outlets.Why It Matters: Trump is fusing his propaganda network with AI tools built on stolen journalism, pushing curated disinformation as \u201csearch.\u201d With investors like Bezos and Nvidia, this move normalizes copyright theft, algorithmic bias, and MAGA-aligned tech in a post-truth media landscape.Source: 404 Media\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News\u2018Horrific\u2019: report reveals abuse of pregnant women and children at US Ice facilitiesWhat Happened: A report from Sen. Jon Ossoff\u2019s office found 510 credible cases of human rights abuses in ICE detention centers since Trump took office in January 2025. Incidents include sexual abuse, mistreatment of pregnant women and children, medical neglect, and overcrowding\u2014amid a 268% spike in arrests and severe limits on congressional oversight.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown has created humanitarian hellscapes inside U.S. detention centers. These are systemic abuses, shielded from scrutiny and inflicted on vulnerable people, including American children.Source: The GuardianThe Return of Family Separation What Happened: Trump has quietly revived family separation, this time targeting immigrant families already inside the U.S. At least nine parents in ICE custody were separated from their children after refusing deportation to dangerous home countries, with ICE officials declaring \u201cinterior separation is approved.\u201dWhy It Matters: Family separation 2.0 is less visible, but no less cruel. Trump is using children as leverage to force deportations, bypassing legal and humanitarian safeguards. The practice is expanding beyond the border and will be used more broadly to meet Trump\u2019s extreme mass deportation goals.Source: New York TimesMigrants Vanish Into Opaque ICE Detention SystemWhat Happened: ICE is accelerating long-distance transfers of detained migrants, often without notice to families or legal counsel. Immigrants like Felix Morales Reyna are being moved through multiple states in days, making legal defense nearly impossible as cases are misassigned to courts hundreds of miles away.Why It Matters: This chaotic, opaque system is eroding due process and trapping people in indefinite detention, forcing some to abandon legal claims out of desperation. With bond denials, restricted court access, and transfers used to sabotage defenses, DHS is turning civil detention into a punitive, extrajudicial tool.Source: Wall Street Journal60 years later, Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters face new threatsWhat Happened: As the Voting Rights Act turns 60, a new conservative legal push aims to block private individuals and civil rights groups from suing under Section 2, which bars racial discrimination in voting. The Supreme Court may soon decide whether only the DOJ can bring such cases\u2014jeopardizing over 90% of the lawsuits historically used to enforce the law.Why It Matters: If the court rules against private enforcement, the Voting Rights Act would become a dead letter\u2014enforced only when a politicized DOJ chooses to act. This would gut a pillar of civil rights and hand states free rein to suppress minority votes.Source: NPRTrump administration to reinstall two Confederate statuesWhat Happened: Trump officials will reinstall two Confederate monuments: Albert Pike\u2019s statue in Washington, DC, and the \u201cReconciliation Monument\u201d at Arlington National Cemetery. Officials say the move follows Trump\u2019s executive orders to \u201crestore American history,\u201d while critics argue it glorifies the Confederacy and sanitizes slavery.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to whitewash America\u2019s racist past and elevate traitors who fought to preserve slavery. Reinstalling these monuments sends a chilling signal about which history\u2014and whose pain\u2014the regime honors.Source: CNNTrump administration to scale back annual human rights reportsWhat Happened: Trump is scaling back the State Department\u2019s annual Human Rights Report, eliminating offices and delaying its release, while shifting its focus to free speech violations\u2014especially those committed by U.S. allies. The 2024 report is expected to downplay broader rights concerns and reflect Trump\u2019s ideological priorities.Why It Matters: This retooling dismantles a cornerstone of U.S. global human rights advocacy. By narrowing the scope and targeting ideological foes, Trump is eroding America\u2019s credibility while shielding autocratic allies from accountability.Source: NBC NewsThere Is an Information Blackout at Florida\u2019s \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 Migrant Detention CampWhat Happened: Over 90 pages of public contracts related to Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d internment camp were quietly removed from the state\u2019s transparency database, while records requests are being ignored or denied. Legal and government watchdogs accuse Gov. Ron DeSantis of violating open records laws to conceal brutal conditions and constitutional abuses at the camp.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated information blackout around a site where detainees are allegedly denied due process and basic human rights. DeSantis is burying evidence of a humanitarian crisis\u2014and breaking the law to do it.Source: Talking Points Memo\u201cAn American Nightmare\u201d: Three Men Deported to CECOT and Their Families Reflect on Their Monthslong OrdealWhat Happened: Over 230 Venezuelan migrants\u2014many without U.S. convictions\u2014were disappeared to El Salvador\u2019s notorious gulag and branded gang members without due process. A ProPublica investigation found the government used tattoos as a primary basis for accusations, despite warnings from experts that this was unreliable.Why It Matters: These mass disappearances bypassed the U.S. justice system and trampled legal norms, outsourcing detention to a foreign dictatorship. It set a dangerous precedent for abandoning due process and outsourcing human rights abuses.Source: ProPublicaAfter a Lull, Agents Conduct a Big Immigration Raid in L.A.What Happened: Federal agents carried out a major immigration raid in Los Angeles\u2019 Westlake neighborhood, hiding inside a Penske rental truck to surprise and arrest 16 undocumented immigrants. The \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d operation took place just days after a federal appeals court upheld a ban on stops based on race, language, or location\u2014raising questions about its legality.Why It Matters: This is a chilling escalation in immigration enforcement, using deception and militarized tactics to target immigrant neighborhoods. Trump\u2019s agents are testing court limits while intimidating communities and undermining local protections.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Administration Begins to Strip Federal Workers of Union ProtectionsWhat Happened: Trump moved to void collective bargaining agreements for over 400,000 Veterans Affairs workers, despite prior court assurances that such actions would wait until ongoing litigation concluded. Labor leaders called it retaliation for resisting Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: Trump is using bogus national security claims to crush federal unions, strip workplace protections, and silence dissent. It\u2019s a power grab aimed at cementing executive control over the civil service.Source: New York TimesRFK Jr. halts $500 million for mRNA vaccine researchWhat Happened: RFK Jr. halted $500 million in federally funded mRNA vaccine research, canceling 22 projects including those from Pfizer, Sanofi, and Moderna. Kennedy claimed mRNA poses \u201cmore risk than benefits\u201d for respiratory viruses due to viral mutations.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting the vaccine tech that saved millions during COVID, weakening U.S. pandemic defenses and giving China an advantage in biotech.Source: CBS NewsTrump administration shifts FEMA staff to ICE during hurricane seasonWhat Happened: Trump officials are reassigning FEMA personnel to help ICE hire 10,000 new agents, warning staff they could be terminated if they refuse. The move, confirmed by DHS, comes at the height of hurricane season, sparking fears that FEMA will be understaffed during natural disasters.Why It Matters: Trump is prioritizing immigration enforcement over disaster preparedness. Diverting FEMA staff to ICE risks slowing emergency response as climate-driven storms intensify\u2014putting lives and communities at greater risk.Source: ReutersWhy Trump is targeting these programs that help keep drug users aliveWhat Happened: Trump barred federal funds from supporting harm reduction efforts like syringe exchanges and overdose prevention centers, calling them \u201cincompatible\u201d with its priorities. SAMHSA was directed to eliminate related grants and may be dissolved entirely.Why It Matters: Trump is defunding life-saving programs backed by research in favor of ideological purity. The move threatens to worsen the overdose crisis by sidelining proven tools that keep drug users alive.Source: Washington PostAre CISA cuts making America safer? Current and former officials clash at hacker conferenceWhat Happened: At the Black Hat hacker conference, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy defended massive staffing purges as a return to the agency\u2019s \u201ccore mission,\u201d while former NSA cyber chief Rob Joyce warned the U.S. has \u201cbackslid\u201d and lost critical national defense capabilities. Nearly a third of CISA\u2019s workforce has been purged since Trump\u2019s return, and the agency has halted election security efforts.Why It Matters: Slashing cyber defenses amid rising threats from Russia, China, and Iran leaves the U.S. dangerously exposed. Trump\u2019s purge of CISA reflects a broader effort to dismantle government expertise\u2014endangering national security.Source: Defense OneEPA considers ending $7 billion Solar for All program fundingWhat Happened: The EPA is considering ending its $7 billion Solar for All program, which funds solar energy access for nearly 900,000 low-income households nationwide. The review follows input from the Office of Management and Budget.Why It Matters: Ending this program would gut one of the largest clean energy investments for disadvantaged communities, stalling projects in every state and delivering a major win for polluters.Source: CBS NewsThese GOP Lawmakers Referred Constituents to the CFPB for Help. Then They Voted to Gut the Agency.What Happened: Multiple Republican lawmakers referred thousands of desperate constituents to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for help with financial issues\u2014then voted to slash the agency\u2019s budget nearly in half. These cuts come despite the CFPB securing over $20 billion in relief for consumers since its founding.Why It Matters: It\u2019s political hypocrisy at its worst. Republicans rely on the CFPB to solve their voters\u2019 problems, but are actively dismantling it to please corporate donors. This leaves everyday Americans more vulnerable to scams, fraud, and financial abuse.Source: ProPublicaTrump administration reverses Biden approval of major wind farm in IdahoWhat Happened: Trump has canceled the Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho, a major renewable energy plan approved under Biden that would have powered up to 500,000 homes. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum framed the reversal as \u201cprotecting\u201d rural interests, while environmental advocates call it politically motivated obstruction.Why It Matters: This is the latest blow to clean energy under Trump, who\u2019s gutting renewables in favor of fossil fuels. The regime is systematically dismantling Biden-era climate progress, even as the planet heats and U.S. energy costs rise.Source: Associated PressHarvard scientists say research could be set back years after funding freezeWhat Happened: Trump has frozen over $2.6 billion in federal research funding to Harvard, halting work on diseases like multiple sclerosis and cancer, after the university refused extremist government demands. The freeze is part of a wider crackdown on elite universities.Why It Matters: This political retaliation punishes science for defying Trump\u2019s ideology. It will set back lifesaving research by years or decades, jeopardize medical breakthroughs, and weaponize funding to wage war on academia.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchU.S. plans to ease human rights criticism of El Salvador, Israel, RussiaWhat Happened: Leaked drafts show the State Department is rewriting human rights reports to whitewash abuses in countries like El Salvador, Israel, and Russia, cutting references to LGBTQ+ discrimination, torture, and corruption.Source: Washington PostRubio orders US diplomats to launch lobbying blitz against Europe's tech lawWhat Happened: Marco Rubio instructed U.S. diplomats across Europe to push for repeal or amendment of the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, framing it as a \u201cthreat\u201d to free speech and U.S. tech companies. The directive follows Trump\u2019s claims that European regulation \u201ccensors\u201d American voices and imposes unfair costs on U.S. firms.Why It Matters: Trump is waging a diplomatic assault to gut EU safeguards against hate speech and disinformation, using state power to protect Silicon Valley giants and far-right extremists. It\u2019s a direct attack on European democracy disguised as \u201cfree speech.\u201dSource: Reuters\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchFederal Agents Directly Copy White Nationalists in Immigration RaidWhat Happened: DHS used a Penske moving truck to deploy masked immigration agents in a Los Angeles raid dubbed \u201cOperation Trojan Horse,\u201d mimicking a tactic used by white nationalist group Patriot Front during a violent Pride Parade ambush earlier this summer. Penske condemned the misuse, stating the government did not inform or seek permission.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration raids are now openly mirroring white nationalist operations\u2014right down to vehicles and tactics\u2014showing ideological alignment in action.Source: The New Republic\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump vows 100% tariff on chips, unless companies are building in the U.S.What Happened: Trump announced a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, exempting companies that manufacture in the U.S. He cited Apple\u2019s $100 billion investment pledge as a model but gave no details on what qualifies a company for exemption.Why It Matters: More economic extortion. Trump\u2019s ultimatum pressures global tech firms to relocate or face punishing costs\u2014fueling trade tensions and supply chain instability at a moment when chips are essential to nearly every industry.Source: CNBCIn letter to Trump, alcohol groups say tariffs put $2 billion in sales at riskWhat Happened: A coalition of 57 alcohol industry groups sent a letter to Trump warning that his 15% tariff on EU goods could wipe out nearly $2 billion in U.S. sales and jeopardize 25,000 jobs. The tariffs hit wine and spirits just before their peak holiday season.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are slamming American bars, restaurants, and alcohol producers with higher costs and lower sales. Industry leaders say the policy will raise prices, kill jobs, and wreck holiday revenue.Source: ReutersStanford Lays Off 361, Citing Trump Funding CutsWhat Happened: Stanford University is laying off 361 staff and cutting $140 million from its budget, citing GOP-driven federal policy changes, new endowment taxes, and uncertainty over future funding. The cuts follow Trump\u2019s broader push to defund universities over extremist disputes.Why It Matters: Another elite university is gutting operations under Trump\u2019s crackdown. The campaign, aimed at perceived liberal strongholds, is hollowing out U.S. research capacity and eroding academic independence.Source: The HillTrump Pledged to Bring Back Manufacturing. The Sector Is SputteringWhat Happened: Despite Trump\u2019s promises and sweeping tariffs, U.S. manufacturing has contracted for months, with the PMI stuck in decline and tens of thousands of jobs lost. Big brands like Apple pledged new U.S. production, but firms such as Whirlpool and Harley-Davidson are cutting output amid tariff chaos and weak demand.Why It Matters: Manufacturing is mired in uncertainty, as unpredictable tariffs and supply chain shocks drive up costs and deter investment.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.Authoritarian Legal Capture \u2014 From intimidating top law firms to sanctioning pro bono attorneys, Trump is dismantling the legal defense infrastructure that holds his regime accountable.Militarization of Civil Life \u2014 Deploying National Guard in D.C., threatening military presence at the LA Olympics, and mirroring white nationalist tactics in raids all underscore a normalization of military force in domestic governance.Surveillance State Expansion \u2014 ICE\u2019s biometric iris scans, Palantir\u2019s AI integration, and DOJ\u2019s political use of intel show how Trump is building a totalizing surveillance apparatus\u2014starting with immigrants as the test group.Weaponization of History \u2014 Reinstalling Confederate monuments, purging civil rights oversight, and rewriting human rights reports reflect a calculated erasure of hard-won democratic progress.Academic Retaliation \u2014 Funding freezes for Harvard, UCLA, and Stanford reveal a systemic campaign to punish universities for ideological noncompliance, weakening U.S. science and research capacity.Union Busting as Power Grab \u2014 Targeting VA workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights is part of a larger purge of independent federal workers in favor of political loyalists.Humanitarian Erosion \u2014 The return of family separation and mass disappearances to foreign prisons without due process marks a deepening of Trump\u2019s human rights abuses.Information Suppression \u2014 Florida\u2019s removal of internment camp records and Congress\u2019s \u201ctechnical error\u201d deleting constitutional protections fit a pattern of deliberate transparency and constitutional erosion.Global Authoritarian Alignment \u2014 Whitewashing abuses by allies like El Salvador and Russia underscores Trump\u2019s foreign policy shift toward protecting authoritarian regimes.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

He also signaled interest in using the Home Rule Act to seize control of the city government.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>  Trump continues testing the limits of executive authority.
