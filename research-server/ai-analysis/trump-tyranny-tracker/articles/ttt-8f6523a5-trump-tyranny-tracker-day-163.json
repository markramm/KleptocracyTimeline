REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File PhotoShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 1Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 6Google Meet: July 8, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenbGI9WySx-YPLAwUeEbzPi7zfkZsU6BVihpGbAGJtQlmTTw/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsUS Consumer Watchdog Scraps $95 Million 'Illegal Fees' Settlement with Navy FederalWhat Happened: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau voided a $95 million settlement with Navy Federal Credit Union over surprise overdraft fees\u2014and dropped a separate case against Fay Servicing. These moves are part of a broader rollback that\u2019s already canceled enforcement actions against Bank of America and Toyota.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s CFPB is gutting consumer protections, letting banks off the hook for cheating customers\u2014including military families. Scrapping these settlements allows corporate abuse, with no consequences and accountability.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsBuoyed by Supreme Court, Trump to Press Forward on Firings and Social AgendaWhat Happened: After the Supreme Court limited nationwide injunctions, Trump is rushing to revive blocked policies\u2014like federal worker purges, transgender healthcare cuts, and ending birthright citizenship. Why It Matters: The ruling gives Trump a green light to fast-track his authoritarian agenda with fewer legal roadblocks. Immigration crackdowns, gender rollbacks, and civil service purges can now advance with limited judicial oversight\u2014shifting even more power to the executive branch.Source: ReutersTrump Floats Daughter-in-Law Lara Trump for North Carolina Senate RunWhat Happened: Trump named Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law, as his pick to replace retiring Senator Thom Tillis\u2014who angered Trump by voting against his spending bill. Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Targets CNN Over Migration App CoverageWhat Happened: Trump officials are exploring whether CNN can be prosecuted for reporting on ICEBlock, an iPhone app that alerts users to nearby immigration agents. Kristi Noem accused CNN of \u201cinterfering\u201d with law enforcement and said she\u2019s working with the DOJ to investigate. Trump endorsed the idea of prosecution, while CNN asserted that its reporting is protected and lawful.Why It Matters: Trump continues testing the limits of the First Amendment by threatening to investigate and prosecute media outlets for journalism he doesn\u2019t like\u2014this time CNN. Going after reporters for covering public information is further escalation in his authoritarian assault on the free press.Source: ReutersPardoned Jan. 6 Rioter Who Threatened Police Joins Justice Dept.What Happened: Jared L. Wise, a former FBI agent and Jan. 6 insurrectionist who shouted \u201cKill \u2019em!\u201d at Capitol police, has been appointed counselor to Ed Martin, head of Trump\u2019s DOJ \u201cWeaponization Working Group.\u201d Pardoned by Trump mid-trial, Wise is now helping oversee retribution against those who prosecuted Jan. 6 cases.Why It Matters: A man who incited violence against law enforcement is now helping weaponize the DOJ to punish Trump\u2019s enemies. This is the justice system turned upside down\u2014rewarding insurrectionists while targeting those who defended democracy.Source: New York TimesDOGE Now Targeting SEC Policy, Eyes SPAC Rules, Sources SayWhat Happened: Unauthorized DOGE is pressuring the SEC to weaken rules on SPACs and private funds. Musk operatives inside the agency are pushing rollbacks of Biden-era protections, prompting internal warnings about political interference.Why It Matters: Trump continues dismantling regulatory independence to seize control over financial oversight. Scrapping these safeguards exposes investors to fraud and heightens systemic risk.Source: ReutersTrump raises possibility of stripping Mamdani of US citizenshipWhat Happened: Trump officials raised the possibility of revoking NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s citizenship. Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen and pro-Palestinian advocate, was labeled a \u201ccommunist\u201d by Trump, who threatened him with arrest and deportation.Why It Matters: Threatening to strip citizenship over political views is meant to silence critics and comes as Trump\u2019s DOJ has made denaturalizing Americans a top priority.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUniversity of Pennsylvania Reaches Compliance Deal with Trump on Transgender AthletesWhat Happened: UPenn struck a deal with Trump disavowing NCAA policies that allowed transgender women to compete in women\u2019s sports. The university apologized to athletes who felt disadvantaged, will revise records, and endorsed Trump-era Title IX rules. The move came after a federal probe and $175M funding freeze tied to Lia Thomas\u2019s 2022 NCAA win.Why It Matters: This is a coerced surrender under financial threat, setting a dangerous precedent where civil rights are dictated by ideology, not law. Capitulating to authoritarians never works\u2014they only come back with more demands and greater repression.Source: ReutersTrump and Musk\u2019s Feud Blows Up Again with Threats of DOGE and DeportationWhat Happened: Trump and Musk\u2019s alliance again erupted into a war over Trump\u2019s tax bill. After Musk attacked the legislation and threatened to form a third party, Trump hit back\u2014floating deportation and slashing subsidies to Tesla and SpaceX. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s threats echo Russia, where oligarchs who defy the Kremlin face retaliation, asset seizures, prison, or worse. No one is ever safe in an authoritarian state.Source: The GuardianTrump again brings up the idea of deporting US citizens for crimesWhat Happened: During a visit to Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d detention center, Trump again floated deporting U.S. citizens convicted of crimes, saying, \u201cMaybe that will be the next job.\u201d Why It Matters: Trump is once again pushing constitutional limits, revealing his lawless mindset. If he follows through, it would gut citizenship protections and turn deportation into a tool for political retribution.Source: ABC NewsTrump Drops Federal Lawsuit Against Iowa Pollster, Refiles in State CourtWhat Happened: Trump dropped his federal lawsuit against Iowa pollster Ann Selzer and The Des Moines Register, refiling in state court to avoid likely dismissal. The suit claims Selzer committed \u201cfraud\u201d by publishing a poll showing Kamala Harris ahead in Iowa\u2014a state Trump later won.Why It Matters: This is lawfare aimed at silencing critics. Trump is targeting pollsters to chill unfavorable polling and bypass free speech protections, part of his broader campaign to intimidate the press and control public discourse.Source: NBC NewsColumbia Receives Warning That Its Accreditation Is at RiskWhat Happened: Columbia University was warned by its accreditor over concerns about campus climate, safety, and legal compliance, following federal scrutiny of its handling of antisemitism.Why It Matters: While still accredited, Columbia risks losing federal aid. The warning reterates Trump\u2019s planned use of accreditation to impose ideological control and reshape higher education by force.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsA private prison firm wants to detain immigrants in this Kansas town. Its residents are pushing backWhat Happened: CoreCivic is attempting to reopen a notorious detention center in Leavenworth, Kansas, for use in new ICE contracts. Locals\u2014including ex-guards and religious groups\u2014are pushing back, citing past abuses and deaths. A judge blocked the move, but CoreCivic is fighting the order.Why It Matters: Even in a pro-Trump stronghold, residents are rejecting profit-driven mass detention tied to human rights violations. The backlash reflects growing bipartisan resistance to private prisons and the brutal cost of Trump\u2019s lawless deportation agenda.Source: The GuardianU.S. holding detainees from Asia, Africa and Europe at Guantanamo Bay immigration facilitiesWhat Happened: Trump is now detaining immigrants from countries like China, Liberia, and the U.K. at Guantanamo Bay, internal records show. Previously used mostly for Latin American detainees, the base now holds both \u201chigh-risk\u201d and \u201clow-risk\u201d immigrants.Why It Matters: Using Guantanamo prison for migrants sidesteps U.S. legal protections and normalizes offshore detention for anyone Trump deems undesirable.Source: CBS NewsA \u201cStriking\u201d Trend: After Texas Banned Abortion, More Women Nearly Bled to Death During MiscarriageWhat Happened: After Texas banned abortion in 2022, ER visits for first-trimester miscarriages rose 25%, and blood transfusions jumped 54%, per ProPublica. Doctors fear prosecution for performing standard care like D&Cs, forcing women to return sicker or nearly die.Why It Matters: Abortion bans are turning routine miscarriages into medical crises. Women are hemorrhaging at home while doctors delay care to avoid prison\u2014putting lives at risk under cruel, vague laws.Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchNational Climate Report Website Goes DarkWhat Happened: The federal climate science site globalchange.gov went offline, just months after Trump cut funding for future National Climate Assessments and fired the 2028 report\u2019s authors. The site was a key hub for climate data used by governments, businesses, and researchers.Why It Matters: By wiping access to critical climate data and halting future reports, Trump is dismantling federal climate science\u2014leaving the public in the dark as the climate crisis accelerates.Source: New York TimesRubio hails end of USAID as study says its elimination could contribute to 14 million deaths in next 5 yearsWhat Happened: Marco Rubio praised the closure of USAID, calling it an end to \u201cinefficiency\u201d as foreign aid is centralized under the State Department. But a Lancet study warns the cuts could lead to over 14 million deaths by 2030\u2014many of them children\u2014due to halted HIV, malaria, and maternal health programs.Why It Matters: Trump, Musk, and Rubio\u2019s purge is a betrayal of American leadership and a global human rights crisis. By dismantling health lifelines, they\u2019ve turned \u201cAmerica First\u201d into a death sentence for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. USAID saved millions of lives and strengthened U.S. soft power\u2014its destruction is a tragedy all Americans should mourn.Source: CNNAt least 17 million Americans would lose insurance under Trump planWhat Happened: The GOP\u2019s spending bill slashes over $1 trillion from Medicaid and ends ACA subsidies, a move that would strip health coverage from at least 17 million Americans, with rural and low-income communities hit hardest.Why It Matters: This is the biggest health care rollback in a generation. The Republican bill will trigger mass coverage losses and hospital closures\u2014especially in red states. All to provide more tax cuts to the wealthy.Source: Washington PostDespite Last-Minute Changes, Senate Bill Deals Blow to Renewable EnergyWhat Happened: The Senate passed Trump\u2019s spending bill that phases out wind and solar tax credits after 2026, stalls thousands of clean energy projects, and adds subsidies for coal used in steelmaking.Why It Matters: This bill guts U.S. clean energy progress just as electricity demand spikes. It threatens climate goals, raises energy costs, and hands new lifelines to fossil fuels\u2014derailing the transition when it matters most.Source: Reuters\u2018Agonizing': How Alaska\u2019s pivotal Republican senator decided to vote for Donald Trump\u2019s billWhat Happened: Sen. Lisa Murkowski cast the deciding vote to pass Trump\u2019s brutal bill slashing Medicaid, SNAP, and taxes\u2014after securing carveouts for Alaska. She admitted the bill would hurt vulnerable Americans but claimed blocking it would have harmed her state more. Why It Matters: Murkowski sold out millions to protect her political career. She called the choice \u201cagonizing\u201d\u2014then voted to rip health care from 17 million and slash food aid. It is cowardice, selfishness, and a betrayal of the vulnerable.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIran-linked hackers threaten to release Trump aides\u2019 emails: ReportWhat Happened: An Iranian hacking group claims to possess 100GB of emails from top Trump officials, including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan. Emails involving Roger Stone and Stormy Daniels were also reportedly accessed. The group previously tried to share Trump campaign data during the 2024 election.Source: The HillIran Shuts Out Nuclear Monitors in Tactics Echoing Cold WarWhat Happened: Iran has ended all cooperation with UN nuclear inspectors and stopped sharing information about its nuclear activities following Israeli and U.S. airstrikes. The IAEA can no longer verify the status or location of 409kg of near-weapons-grade uranium, raising fears Tehran may have moved it to a secret site\u2014despite Trump claims the nuclear program was \u201cobliterated.\u201dSource: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPentagon halting some promised munitions for UkraineWhat Happened: The Pentagon, under Trump appointee Elbridge Colby, has frozen delivery of critical air defense systems and munitions to Ukraine, citing \u201clow stockpiles\u201d\u2014even though the aid was already approved by Congress and some weapons in Poland. The pause comes as Russia unleashes its heaviest aerial assault yet, with over 5,400 drones and hundreds of missiles fired in June.Why It Matters: This guts Ukraine\u2019s defenses as Russia escalates against all Ukrainian cities and mirrors Trump\u2019s 2019 illegal aid freeze which led to his impeachment. Trump and Republicans continue aiding Russia\u2019s genocidal war by starving Ukraine of weaponsSource: PoliticoA Pro-Russia Disinformation Network Is Using Free AI to Flood the Internet with FakesWhat Happened: A Kremlin-backed disinformation campaign called Operation Overload is flooding the internet with fake content generated by free AI tools. Researchers found over 587 AI-generated images, videos, and websites impersonating real media and pushing racist, anti-immigrant narratives between September 2024 and May 2025.Why It Matters: Russia continues mass-producing propaganda and disinformation using off-the-shelf AI. It\u2019s overwhelming social media with fakes designed to rig elections, incite hatred, and subvert democracies, while social media platforms allow these. operations to run rampant.Source: WIRED\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsRepublican Bill Puts Nation on New, More Perilous Fiscal PathWhat Happened: Senate Republicans passed a bill making Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new ones. Using budget gimmicks, they claim the $3.8 trillion cost is zero, despite estimates that it will ultimately cost over $5.3 trillion. The bill passed through reconciliation, bypassing bipartisan support or debt safeguards.Why It Matters: This bill gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy, fuels long-term deficits, and makes a future debt crisis far more likely, while putting programs like Social Security at risk.Source: New York TimesUS Private Payrolls Post First Drop in Over Two Years; Layoffs Remain LowWhat Happened: U.S. private payrolls fell by 33,000 in June, marking the first decline since March 2023, according to ADP. Sectors like professional services and healthcare lost jobs, while leisure, manufacturing, and construction added jobs. Why It Matters: The unexpected drop highlights growing economic uncertainty, but steady layoff levels suggest the labor market remains resilient, for now. Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Tariffs Blocked Rate Cuts, Fed Chair SaysWhat Happened: Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank would have cut interest rates if not for Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which raised inflation forecasts and introduced global economic uncertainty. Despite Trump\u2019s insults and pressure, Powell defended the Fed\u2019s decision to hold rates steady and reaffirmed its independence.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade policies are directly interfering with monetary policy, forcing the Fed to delay rate cuts that could ease financial pressure on Americans.
