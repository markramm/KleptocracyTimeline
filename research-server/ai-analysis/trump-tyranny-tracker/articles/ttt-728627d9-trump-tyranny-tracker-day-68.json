Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn/Getty Images North AmericaShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 28Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Pardons BitMEX Founders Convicted of Money LaunderingWhat Happened: Trump has granted full pardons to BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, who were convicted of violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement anti-money laundering controls. The pardons were signed quietly Thursday and not publicly announced.Why It Matters: This Trump-issued pardon shields high-profile crypto executives convicted of running a \u201cmoney laundering platform,\u201d sending a dangerous message that financial fraud can be wiped clean with the right political connections. It undermines market integrity, guts equal enforcement of financial laws, and shows Trump is using his power to protect the crypto world\u2014no matter how dirty the money.Source: USA TodayTrump Pardons Nikola Founder and Top Donor Convicted of FraudWhat Happened: Trump pardoned Trevor Milton, founder of bankrupt EV startup Nikola, who was convicted of securities fraud for deceiving investors about the company\u2019s technology. Milton, who staged a fake demo of a truck that was actually rolling downhill, had been sentenced to four years in prison but had not yet served time.Why It Matters: Milton and his wife donated $1.8 million to Trump\u2019s re-election, and now he walks free. The pardon could erase hundreds of millions owed to defrauded investors. Trump claims Milton was only prosecuted for backing him\u2014calling him innocent\u2014turning clemency into a political loyalty test and shredding the idea of equal justice.Source: Associated PressWe Mapped DOGE\u2019s Silicon Valley and Corporate ConnectionsWhat Happened: WIRED has mapped the backgrounds of dozens of operatives working inside unauthorized DOGE, revealing a deep network of ties to Musk, his companies, and his allies. At least 49 DOGE staffers have links to Musk\u2019s empire\u2014SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, Neuralink, and X\u2014as well as to allies like Peter Thiel and firms like Palantir. Why It Matters: This is cronyism disguised as reform. Musk\u2019s tech allies are being embedded deep inside federal agencies, turning public institutions into tools of a private billionaire\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s not about efficiency\u2014it\u2019s a hostile takeover that blurs the line between government and corporate power.Source: WIREDElon Musk Deletes Tweet Promising to Hand Out \u2018Two Checks For a Million Dollars\u2019 At Campaign Event As He\u2019s Accused of \u2018Blatant Felony\u2019What Happened: Musk deleted a tweet promising to personally give $1 million checks to two voters at a Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign event. After public backlash, Musk clarified the money would go to \u201cspokesmen\u201d for his anti-judge petition\u2014not to voters. Critics say his original post was a blatant attempt to buy votes.Why It Matters: Offering money in exchange for voting is a felony under Wisconsin law. State Attorney General Josh Kaul said he plans legal action to block Musk\u2019s giveaway. Musk\u2019s group had already paid a Green Bay voter $1 million and offered smaller sums for petition signers and referrals.Source: MediaiteTrump\u2019s Budget Chief Pushes Massive Power GrabWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget director and architect of Project 2025, Russell Vought, is pushing a $9 trillion slash to federal spending, cutting housing aid, food stamps, student loans, and Medicaid\u2014all while firing thousands of civil servants.Why It Matters: Vought\u2019s plan merges Christian nationalism with fiscal extremism, handing sweeping power to Trump to defund programs\u2014even without Congress. It\u2019s a blunt power grab to dismantle the federal government.Source: The New York TimesFired FTC Regulator Warns of \u2018Rule of Billionaires\u2019 Under TrumpWhat Happened: Alvaro Bedoya, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, was abruptly fired last week by Trump\u2014an unprecedented move. Bedoya, alongside fellow fired commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, is suing Trump, calling the dismissals illegal.Why It Matters: Bedoya warns the firings signal a \u201cblinking red alarm\u201d that billionaire influence is overtaking the rule of law. He alleges a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d system is emerging under Trump, where corporate regulators are purged to benefit Trump\u2019s wealthy allies.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsHegseth\u2019s Brother Lands Key Pentagon Role, Raising Nepotism ConcernsWhat Happened: Hegseth\u2019s younger brother, Phil Hegseth, is serving as a senior adviser and Department of Homeland Security liaison inside the Pentagon. He has traveled with the secretary on official trips, met with high-level officials, and appears to hold an office just down the hall from his brother\u2019s. Why It Matters: While DHS claims Phil Hegseth is their employee, his proximity to his brother and role as a senior adviser inside the Pentagon raises serious questions about nepotism and potential violations of federal hiring laws. Source: Military TimesTrump Deportation Fight Reaches Supreme CourtWhat Happened: Trump asked the Supreme Court to greenlight mass deportations of Venezuelans using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Why It Matters: The case tests Trump\u2019s use of wartime powers to deport thousands without due process. A court blocked the policy, and Trump is pushing the Supreme Court to restore it\u2014potentially dangerously reshaping presidential authority on immigration and national security.Source: The New York TimesMusk to Visit CIA Monday What Happened: Musk will meet with CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Monday to discuss agency restructuring. The visit comes amid sweeping federal purges, including at the CIA.Why It Matters: Musk is an unelected enforcer in Trump\u2019s consolidation of power\u2014 purging intelligence staff and influencing intel operations without holding any formal office. It\u2019s a dangerous politicization of national security and a clear warning about billionaire control of the state.Source: ReutersUS Securities and Exchange Commission beginning to bring on DOGE staff, email saysWhat Happened: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has begun to integrate Musk\u2019s unvetted operatives, according to an internal email. The message confirms these individuals will be granted system and data access.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s operatives are now taking over the SEC. These unelected loyalists are being embedded deep inside America\u2019s top financial watchdog, opening the door to political favoritism, insider deals, retribution, and gutting oversight. It\u2019s deregulation disguised as \u201cefficiency\u201d\u2014and a direct threat to market integrity.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump\u2019s Secret Police Are Stalking More and More StudentsWhat Happened: ICE is detaining pro-Palestinian international students\u2014often without charges. Cornell student Momodou Taal and others are suing Trump, calling it political retaliation for campus speech critical of Israel. Visa revocations, surveillance, and sudden deportations are being used to intimidate.Why It Matters: This is political repression. Foreign students are being targeted for protected speech, detained without charges, and in some cases disappeared. This is a textbook example of Trump weaponizing immigration to silence dissent and spread fear on campuses.Source: Mother JonesTrump\u2019s FCC commissioner opens investigation into Walt Disney Co. and ABC for diversity policiesWhat Happened: FCC Chair Brendan Carr announced an investigation into Disney and its ABC network for allegedly \u201cpromoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination.\u201d Why It Matters: This is a blatant political attack on corporate speech and workplace diversity. Trump is weaponizing federal agencies to punish perceived ideological opponents and force companies to abandon inclusive policies.Source: Associated PressTrump DOJ Weaponizes Power to Enforce Gun RightsWhat Happened: The Justice Department has launched an investigation into the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department over delays in issuing concealed carry permits. Bondi claims residents\u2019 Second Amendment rights are being violated due to wait times of up to 18 months.Why It Matters: This is the latest example of the DOJ being weaponized under Trump\u2014prioritizing gun rights over all else while attacking local jurisdictions.

Nonprofits critical to local recovery are being targeted under the guise of immigration enforcement\u2014leaving vulnerable communities to suffer.Source: PoliticoSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsHegseth Brought His Wife to Sensitive Meetings With Foreign Military OfficialsWhat Happened: Hegseth took his wife Jennifer\u2014an ex-Fox News producer with no verified clearance\u2014into high-level Pentagon and NATO meetings where classified topics like cutting intelligence to Ukraine and military coordination were discussed. Foreign officials were reportedly confused by her presence.Why It Matters: Hegseth is turning the Pentagon into a Fox News family business. Already under fire for leaking military strike details, he's bringing his unelected and unvetted wife to sensitive national security meetings. This is a reckless breach of protocol that endangers U.S. alliances, national security, and intelligence. Amateur hour at the highest levels of defense.Source: Wall Street JournalSotomayor Warns About \u2018Arbitrary Power\u2019 While Defending Judicial IndependenceWhat Happened: Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a stark warning about the erosion of the rule of law, telling Georgetown Law students that \u201carbitrary power\u201d leads to injustice at the whim of those in charge. She emphasized the need to defend judicial independence amid growing threats from political leaders.Why It Matters: Sotomayor\u2019s warning is a clear rebuke of Trump\u2019s authoritarian attacks on the judiciary. Without naming him, she spotlighted the grave danger of a president targeting judges and dismantling legal norms\u2014threats that echo the playbook of autocrats, not democratically elected leaders.Source: USA TodayTrump Orders Smithsonian to Promote \u2018American Greatness,\u2019 Echoing Authoritarian Rewrite of HistoryWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History\u201d demanding the Smithsonian pivot away from what he called a \u201crace-centered ideology\u201d and stop promoting narratives that portray Western values as \u201charmful and oppressive.\u201d He wants all Smithsonian exhibits \u2014 including the Women\u2019s History Museum \u2014 to align with \u201cshared American values\u201d and reject \u201cideologies inconsistent with federal law.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is authoritarian history-washing\u2014straight from the Russian playbook. Trump is purging truth, commandeering cultural institutions, and enforcing propaganda that glorifies power while erasing injustice. From museums to monuments to national parks, it\u2019s an extremist effort to rewrite America\u2019s story to fit his agenda.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsNaval Academy Takes Steps to End Diversity Policies in Books and AdmissionsWhat Happened: The U.S. Naval Academy has officially ended its use of affirmative action in admissions and began removing diversity-related books from its library. The moves follow Hegseth\u2019s orders to enforce Trump\u2019s January 29 executive order to end \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d across the federal government, including military academies.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian tactic, not policy. Banning books like The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr. and gutting DEI at the Naval Academy isn\u2019t about readiness\u2014it\u2019s about erasing history and enforcing ideological control.

Students from Tufts, Columbia, and the University of Alabama were swept up\u2014some snatched off the street by masked men\u2014and sent hundreds of miles away. Rights groups call the tactic punitive and dangerous.Why It Matters: Louisiana is now a detention epicenter under Trump, holding 7,000 immigrants\u2014many in remote facilities far from legal help. This is a deliberate effort to silence dissent and chill campus activism. Today they\u2019re disappearing students with visas\u2014tomorrow it could be anyone who dares to dissent. This is exactly why pushing back now is urgent.Source: Associated PressUniversity of Minnesota Student Detained by Immigration AgentsWhat Happened: ICE agents arrested a graduate student at the University of Minnesota on Thursday without the university\u2019s prior knowledge. The student, enrolled at the Carlson School of Management, was detained at an off-campus residence.

Ratcliffe\u2019s language about \u201cmobilizing assets\u201d and \u201cstarting points for coverage\u201d hints at how the CIA tracks targets. Waltz casually describing a Houthi leader entering \u201chis girlfriend\u2019s building\u201d may have compromised on the ground sources. It\u2019s not just reckless\u2014it\u2019s dangerous.Source: CNNDOGE Plans to Rebuild SSA Code Base in Months, Risking Benefits and System CollapseWhat Happened: Musk is pushing the Social Security Administration to replace its decades-old COBOL-based system with a new Java codebase\u2014within months. COBOL, the backbone of SSA\u2019s infrastructure, handles over 70 million Americans\u2019 benefits. This is led by Musk ally Steve Davis, with unvetted operatives embedded in the agency.Why It Matters: The rushed timeline could result in benefit delays, errors, or complete system failure. SSA\u2019s systems weren\u2019t built for rapid modernization, and rewriting millions of lines of legacy code in months is unprecedented. This puts tens of millions of seniors, disabled Americans, and survivors at risk.Source: WIREDTrump's Social Security Shakeup Alarms Seniors, Prompts Delays and New RestrictionsWhat Happened: Seniors across the U.S. are increasingly anxious after major changes in the Social Security Administration. The agency has cut 7,000 jobs (12% of its workforce), doubling average wait times on calls to over 100 minutes. In-person ID checks and new limits on banking updates were suddenly imposed\u2014then delayed after backlash.Why It Matters: 70+ million Americans rely on Social Security, but now many can\u2019t get through on the phone, and essential services are harder to access. Source: CBS NewsEmotional Education Department 'clap-outs' celebrate departed federal employeesWhat Happened: Trump has laid off roughly 50% of the Department of Education\u2019s workforce, as part of a broader effort to dismantle the agency. Departing employees were given 30 minutes to collect their belongings before being \u201cclapped out\u201d by colleagues in emotional farewell ceremonies. Entire divisions, like the Office of the Chief Data Officer, have been eliminated.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t reform\u2014it\u2019s destruction. By gutting the agency and eliminating the very offices that track student progress and data, Trump is crippling federal oversight of public education. Source: ABC NewsTop F.D.A. Vaccine Official Resigns, Citing Kennedy\u2019s \u2018Misinformation and Lies\u2019What Happened: Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA\u2019s vaccine division, resigned Friday after the Trump regime he could quit or be fired. In his resignation letter, Marks accused RFK Jr. of spreading \u201cmisinformation and lies\u201d about vaccines and undermining public health.Why It Matters: Marks was a leading figure during the COVID-19 pandemic and a widely respected scientist. His departure signals a major blow to scientific integrity inside the FDA and raises alarms that vaccine policy is being overtaken by anti-vaccine ideology. Source: The New York TimesRFK Jr. to gut vaccine promotion and HIV prevention office, sources sayWhat Happened: RFK Jr. plans to lay off the entire staff of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy, which leads federal efforts to promote childhood vaccination and HIV prevention. The cuts are part of a broader purge of 20,000 HHS employees under his restructuring plan.Why It Matters: The office was central to efforts like the \"Let's Get Real\" campaign, which addressed vaccine hesitancy among parents. Also targeted for elimination is the Office of Minority Health. Experts warn this will severely undermine public health and HIV prevention at a time of rising disease threats.Source: CBS NewsCDC Buried Measles Forecast Urging Vaccination, Echoes RFK Jr.'s Anti-Vaccine RhetoricWhat Happened: The CDC blocked the release of an internal measles risk forecast warning of high transmission in areas with low vaccination rates. The agency originally planned to highlight the importance of vaccines but instead issued a statement aligning with RFK Jr.\u2019s language, calling vaccination \u201ca personal choice.\u201dWhy It Matters: Under anti-vaccine nut RFK Jr., the CDC is downplaying measles risks, muzzling its own experts, and adopting fringe rhetoric\u2014all while planning mass layoffs. Public health leaders say it\u2019s a dangerous shift that could cost lives.Source: ProPublicaWest Texas Measles Patients Show Signs of Vitamin A Toxicity, Raising Alarm Over DisinformationWhat Happened: The Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock reported that several unvaccinated children are showing signs of vitamin A toxicity\u2014likely caused by unsupervised use of high-dose supplements promoted by RFK Jr.Why It Matters: Health experts say this surge in vitamin A misuse is a direct result of dangerous disinformation pushed by RFK Jr. By promoting supplements over vaccines, RFK is fueling preventable harm\u2014especially to children\u2014and reviving the same disinformation tactics that worsened the COVID crisis.Source: CNNMeasles Outbreak Surges: Nearly 500 Cases Across 19 StatesWhat Happened: The CDC has confirmed 483 measles cases across 19 states\u2014most among unvaccinated children. The epicenter remains in west Texas, with 400 cases and rising. Alarming reports from hospitals show some children are now suffering vitamin A toxicity after being given high doses by parents, following RFK\u2019s disinformation.Why It Matters: RFK Jr. has promoted vitamin A as a measles treatment, fueling confusion and dangerous misuse. Vitamin A cannot prevent measles, and RFK Jr.\u2019s vaccine skepticism is directly contributing to the spread. He is undermining public health\u2014and kids are paying the price.Source: ABC NewsUSAID Officially Shuttered as Trump Moves Foreign Aid Under State DeptWhat Happened: The State Department announced Friday it is officially dissolving USAID, transferring its core functions to the State Department. The move came just hours before a federal appeals court lifted a ruling blocking the shutdown. Thousands of USAID staff have already been laid off, and more than 80% of programs defunded.Why It Matters: This is the end of America\u2019s effective foreign aid agency\u2014and a gift to Russia and China. By gutting an agency that delivered health, food, and education to millions, Trump is handing global influence to authoritarian rivals. The excuse is \u201cefficiency.\u201d The reality is abandonment, chaos, and a retreat from U.S. leadership.Source: ABC News\u2018Heartless and Dangerous\u2019: Trump Eyes Layoffs, Automation at VA Call CentersWhat Happened: Trump is advancing a plan to lay off call center staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs and replace them with automated systems. The move is part of  Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to purge tens of thousands of federal jobs.Why It Matters: The VA call centers are a vital resource for military veterans seeking medical care and support. Removing human agents could severely disrupt access, especially for elderly and disabled veterans.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIsraeli Officials Furious That Signal Group Chat Exposed Intelligence, Sources SayWhat Happened: Israeli officials are outraged after a leaked Signal group chat between senior Trump officials revealed sensitive intelligence shared by Israel with the U.S. The intel came from a human source in Yemen and was used to justify airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants. The leak reportedly compromised that source, despite assurances from Trump officials that \u201cno sources or methods\u201d were exposed.Why It Matters: This leak is a disaster. It jeopardized Israeli intelligence sources and jeopardized live military operations. It\u2019s not just sloppy\u2014it\u2019s dangerous and shatters trust in America\u2019s ability to safeguard critical intel.Source: CBS NewsJD Vance Says Denmark Failed Greenland, Pushes U.S. Control of IslandWhat Happened: In a provocative Arctic trip, Vance accused Denmark of failing Greenland and made the clearest case yet for U.S. control of the island. Speaking from a U.S. military base, Vance claimed America had \u201cno other option\u201d but to increase its presence, citing alleged Russian and Chinese interest.Why It Matters: This is blunt imperialism. Trump has vowed to take Greenland \u201cone way or another,\u201d and Vance is laying the groundwork. By declaring Denmark a failure and calling for regime change, he\u2019s echoing the very behavior the U.S. once condemned from Russia. Source: CNNVance Tells Greenlanders Their Land Is \u201cCold as S---,\u201d and China\u2019s coming for youWhat Happened: During a controversial visit to Greenland, Vance claimed Denmark had left the island vulnerable to China and Russia while doubling down on Trump\u2019s threats.Why It Matters: The blunt comments have escalated tensions with Denmark and Greenland\u2019s leaders, fueling backlash over Trump\u2019s imperial-style rhetoric and U.S. power projection in the Arctic.Source: The TelegraphGreenland residents asked if they want to greet Usha Vance said, 'No, thank you'What Happened: As Usha Vance prepared to visit Greenland, U.S. officials reportedly struggled to find local residents in Nuuk willing to greet her. According to Danish broadcaster TV2, the common response was: \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d A local travel agency also canceled hosting her, rejecting what they called the visit\u2019s \u201cunderlying agenda.\u201dWhy It Matters: Greenlanders are openly rejecting Trump\u2019s annexation push, with local leaders refusing to meet Vance\u2019s wife. The snub highlights deep resentment and growing global backlash to what many see as a blatant act of U.S. imperialism.Source: USA Today\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRubio Says Information on Abducted Ukrainian Children Will Be PreservedWhat Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the State Department preserved a critical database documenting the mass kidnappings of Ukrainian children by Russia\u2014data lawmakers feared was deleted after Trump defunded the Yale-led program tracking the kidnappings. Russia has kidnapped over 21,000 Ukrainian children in an act of genocide.Why It Matters: The pushback worked\u2014this time. Despite Trump\u2019s aid cuts, the State Department reportedly preserved the database. Hopefully, it will be handed to the ICC and Europol to assist in war crimes and genocide investigations against Putin and other Russian officials.Source: The New York TimesNew U.S mineral deal imposes onerous conditions, Ukrainian officials sayWhat Happened: Ukrainian officials say a new U.S. minerals deal \u201cdramatically\u201d rewrites previously agreed terms, adding conditions they had already rejected. President Zelenskyy said the proposal must be reviewed from scratch and warned he won\u2019t back any agreement that jeopardizes Ukraine\u2019s path to joining the EU.Why It Matters: This minerals extortion deal is a trap. The abrupt shift in terms plays directly into Trump\u2019s narrative of Ukraine as ungrateful\u2014laying the groundwork to cut aid and advance Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals under the guise of diplomacy.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsDow Closes 700 Points Lower Amid Inflation and Tariff FearsWhat Happened: The Dow fell 715 points on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also tumbling as tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon posted sharp losses. The drop came after inflation data came in hotter than expected, rising 2.8% in February, and long-term inflation expectations hit their highest level since 1993. Why It Matters: This is the latest signal that Trump\u2019s tariff blitz is rattling global markets and fueling inflation concerns. With retaliatory moves already underway from Canada and the EU, investors are bracing for more volatility\u2014especially with further White House tariff announcements expected on April 2.Source: CNBCCanadians Pull Back on U.S. Trips, Threatening to Widen $50 Billion Travel DeficitWhat Happened: Canadian travel to the U.S. is dropping significantly amid political tensions, Trump\u2019s annexation rhetoric, rising visa hurdles, and retaliatory sentiment. February saw return flights down 13% and land crossings down 23% from last year. Hotel demand near border cities like Niagara Falls and Bellingham has also declined.Why It Matters: Canada is the largest source of international visitors to the U.S., and the pullback threatens to deepen America\u2019s $50+ billion travel deficit. Source: CNBCInflation Spike Worries Wall StreetWhat Happened: Wall Street took a hit Friday after a hotter-than-expected inflation report reignited investor fears. The Dow dropped 715 points, the S&P 500 fell 2%, and the Nasdaq tumbled 2.7%. The downturn followed Commerce Department data showing the personal consumption expenditures index rose 2.5% year-over-year\u20142.8% when excluding food and energy.Why It Matters: The spike suggests inflation isn\u2019t cooling as hoped. Analysts say tariffs and rising costs may keep inflation \u201chot,\u201d leaving the Federal Reserve with fewer tools to support the economy.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudges Temporarily Block Trump Orders Targeting Law Firms Jenner and Block, WilmerHaleWhat Happened: Two federal judges in D.C. temporarily halted Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at punishing law firms Jenner and Block and WilmerHale, which have ties to Trump\u2019s political opponents.

BitMEX Founders Convicted of Money Laundering</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has granted full pardons to BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, who were convicted of violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement anti-money laundering controls. The pardons were signed quietly Thursday and not publicly announced.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This Trump-issued pardon shields high-profile crypto executives convicted of running a \\u201Cmoney laundering platform,\\u201D sending a dangerous message that financial fraud can be wiped clean with the right political connections.

Milton, who staged a fake demo of a truck that was actually rolling downhill, had been sentenced to four years in prison but had not yet served time.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Milton and his wife donated $1.8 million to Trump\\u2019s re-election, and now he walks free. The pardon could erase hundreds of millions owed to defrauded investors. Trump claims Milton was only prosecuted for backing him\\u2014calling him innocent\\u2014turning clemency into a political loyalty test and shredding the idea of equal justice.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/nikola-trevor-milton-fraud-trump-pardon-3fcebb0a3820cecb205656f2dc3f6764\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>We Mapped DOGE\\u2019s Silicon Valley and Corporate Connections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> WIRED has mapped the backgrounds of dozens of operatives working inside unauthorized DOGE, revealing a deep network of ties to Musk, his companies, and his allies.

After public backlash, Musk clarified the money would go to \\u201Cspokesmen\\u201D for his anti-judge petition\\u2014not to voters. Critics say his original post was a blatant attempt to buy votes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Offering money in exchange for voting is a felony under Wisconsin law. State Attorney General Josh Kaul said he plans legal action to block Musk\\u2019s giveaway.

Visa revocations, surveillance, and sudden deportations are being used to intimidate.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is political repression.

Foreign officials were reportedly confused by her presence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Hegseth is turning the Pentagon into a Fox News family business.
