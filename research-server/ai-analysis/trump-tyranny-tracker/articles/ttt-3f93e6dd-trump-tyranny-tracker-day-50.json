(Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 10Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsDHS Awards GOP-Linked Firms $200M Ad Campaign Without Competitive BiddingWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security bypassed standard competitive bidding procedures to award two Republican-linked firms the first contracts of a $200 million television ad campaign promoting Trump\u2019s immigration policies. DHS justified the move by citing Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, allowing them to fast-track the contracts under \u201cunusual and compelling urgency\u201d rules.Why It Matters: Taxpayer money is funding a Trump ad blitz, blurring the line between governance and propaganda. Skipping competitive bidding reeks of cronyism and politicizing federal resources.Source: Associated PressTrump Weakens Landmark Environmental Law, A Gift to Big OilWhat Happened: The Interior Department suspended a Biden-era legal opinion that held corporations liable for accidentally killing migratory birds under the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The reversal, championed by oil billionaire Harold Hamm, shields energy and construction companies from penalties for killing birds during drilling, mining, wind energy production, and construction.Why It Matters: The guts accountability for industries responsible for some of the nation\u2019s worst environmental disasters which killed hundreds of thousands of birds. Big Oil wins again while conservation efforts take a major hit.Source: Washington PostHouse GOP conservatives make plea to 'hesistant' moderates on Medicaid changesWhat Happened: The House Freedom Caucus is pressuring GOP moderates to support major Medicaid cuts, framing them as necessary \"reforms\" to curb expansion and finance Trump\u2019s domestic policies, including tax cuts for the wealthy.Why It Matters: While claiming to fight waste, Republicans are slashing healthcare for vulnerable populations to bankroll tax breaks for the rich and push their extremist agenda.Source: PoliticoTrump Moves to Weaken Chemical Safety RulesWhat Happened: The EPA announced plans to ease regulations on chemical safety screenings, potentially limiting restrictions on hazardous substances. The proposed changes would assume that workers handling toxic chemicals wear protective gear, making it harder to classify chemicals as dangerous.Why It Matters: Loosening chemical safety regulations will lead to increased public health risks and reduce accountability for polluters, prioritizing corporate interests over environmental and consumer protections.Source: The HillAmazon Streams Trump\u2019s The Apprentice Amid Growing Ties with White HouseWhat Happened: Amazon announced it will begin streaming Trump\u2019s reality show The Apprentice, potentially funneling profits to Trump. The move follows Amazon\u2019s $1 million donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration and a $40 million budget for Melania Trump\u2019s documentary.Why It Matters: The deal highlights corporate cronyism as Jeff Bezos aligns with Trump. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, has also curbed criticism of Trump, further undermining media independence.Source: The HillBlackRock Becomes a Power Player in Global Shipping\u2014With Help From TrumpWhat Happened: BlackRock secured a $22.8 billion deal for 40+ global ports, including key Panama Canal terminals, after Trump threatened Panama. The rushed sale, brokered through insider ties between Larry Fink, Trump officials, and billionaire dealmakers, highlights backroom dealings and corporate favoritism.Why It Matters: This deal hands Wall Street massive control over global trade while rewarding Trump\u2019s political allies. It highlights the blurred lines between private wealth and government power, as U.S. policy shifts benefit BlackRock\u2019s empire over national security interests.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMusk Expands DOGE\u2019s Grip on Government, Plans to Double StaffWhat Happened: Musk announced plans to double his operatives of unauthorized FAKE DOGE to 200 employees, expanding its influence across nearly every federal agency. Musk made clear he isn\u2019t leaving the government anytime soon, suggesting he may outlast his temporary appointment.Why It Matters: Musk is slashing Social Security, IRS enforcement, and environmental protections while gutting the federal workforce under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201d His unchecked power raises constitutional concerns as watchdogs warn of illegal actions and lack of oversight.Source: NBC NewsIt's 'shoot first and ask questions later' as DOGE tries to dismantle CFPB: OfficialWhat Happened: A CFPB official testified that Trump\u2019s FAKE DOGE attempted to fire the majority of the agency\u2019s workforce and fulfill its legal obligations with a skeleton crew before a judge halted the takeover. Internal chaos ensued as officials scrambled to dismantle and partially reinstate parts of the agency, leading to lost data and disrupted services.Why It Matters: The CFPB was created to protect consumers from predatory financial practices, and its dismantling signals an open season for corporate abuse. Trump and Musk continue to gut oversight, prioritizing corporate interests over consumer protections.Source: ABC NewsTrump Cuts Election Cybersecurity Funding, Raising Meddling FearsWhat Happened: Trump has halted millions in federal funding for two cybersecurity programs, including one supporting state and local election officials. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ended $10 million in annual funding to the nonprofit Center for Internet Security. The regime has also disbanded an FBI task force dedicated to investigating foreign influence in U.S. elections.Why It Matters: Cutting election security funding weakens defenses against foreign and domestic interference and cyber threats, increasing the risk of meddling in upcoming elections. U.S. election integrity is being deliberately undermined.Source: Associated PressTrump Completes 83% Purge of USAID ProgramsWhat Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Trump has completed its six-week dismantling of USAID, eliminating 83% of its programs. The remaining 18% will be transferred under the State Department\u2019s control. Why It Matters: USAID has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for six decades, stabilizing economies, preventing conflict, and strengthening alliances. Its destruction will leave millions without humanitarian aid, weaken U.S. global influence, and create power vacuums for rivals like China and Russia to exploit. Source: ABC NewsMusk and DOGE try to slash government by cutting out those who answer to votersWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are making massive cuts to the federal government\u2014circumventing Congress and elected officials. Some fiscal conservatives are alarmed by the power grab, warning that no one accountable to voters is making these decisions.Why It Matters: Musk continues to consolidate power, undermining democratic accountability and congressional authority over government spending. Source: Associated PressUS Labor Board Declines to Defend Law Protecting Members from Trump\u2019s FiringsWhat Happened: The National Labor Relations Board is abandoning its legal defense of a law restricting the president\u2019s ability to fire board members at will. This comes as Trump pushes to remove Democratic NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, challenging long-standing rules that shield independent agencies from White House control.Why It Matters: This accelerates Trump\u2019s effort to consolidate power over independent federal agencies, dismantling traditional checks on presidential authority. By gutting the NLRB\u2019s independence, Trump is tilting labor policy to benefit corporations and allies like Musk, further eroding worker protections.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s IRS Overhaul Guts EnforcementWhat Happened: Trump has laid off over 7,000 IRS employees, including auditors focused on large businesses and wealthy taxpayers, leaving tax enforcement in disarray. Trump is slashing the agency\u2019s workforce by up to 50% while installing political loyalists, like former Congressman Billy Long, to take control.Why It Matters: With fewer auditors, wealthy individuals and corporations face less scrutiny, while ordinary taxpayers may struggle to get assistance. Trump and Elon Musk are automating IRS functions, canceling contracts with tech vendors, and asserting unprecedented political control over an agency meant to operate independently.Source: The New York TimesMusk\u2019s Team Seized Social Security in a \u2018Hostile Takeover,\u2019 Former Official SaysWhat Happened: Musk and his operatives aggressively took control of the Social Security Administration, demanding access to sensitive taxpayer data while ignoring legal safeguards and established security protocols. Musk\u2019s unvetted operatives, with no government experience, bypassed normal channels and recklessly exposed the private data of millions of Americans.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unrestricted access to taxpayer data is a major security risk, and his seizing the agency could disrupt Social Security payments for 73 million Americans. With Trump purging SSA leadership and executing mass layoffs, concerns grow over a deliberate effort to dismantle the agency.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEducation Civil Rights Office Redirected to Trump\u2019s Political AgendaWhat Happened: The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, historically responsible for enforcing disability rights and anti-discrimination laws in schools, has been repurposed under Trump to focus on his political priorities. Pending cases\u2014including those involving students with disabilities\u2014were stalled for weeks, while new investigations targeting antisemitism, transgender policies, and DEI programs have surged. Why It Matters: The shift away from traditional civil rights enforcement leaves vulnerable students\u2014especially those with disabilities\u2014without crucial protections. Career staff have been sidelined or pressured out, further weakening oversight. Trump\u2019s weaponization of the OCR highlights his intent to reshape civil rights enforcement to align with his extremist agenda rather than protect students from discrimination.Source: Associated PressGabbard Revokes Security Clearances for Trump\u2019s Political EnemiesWhat Happened: Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stripped security clearances from top Biden officials, prosecutors who worked on Trump cases, and a key whistleblower attorney. Those targeted include Antony Blinken, Jake Sullivan, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, and Mark Zaid, the lawyer behind Trump\u2019s first impeachment.Why It Matters: Trump is using security clearances as a political weapon, punishing those who challenged him. The move escalates Trump\u2019s revenge campaign against former officials and prosecutors who investigated him.Source: NBC NewsTrump Revokes Biden\u2019s Access to Intelligence BriefingsWhat Happened: DNI Gabbard announced that Trump has officially revoked Biden\u2019s access to the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a classified intelligence report typically provided to former presidents. Why It Matters: This is blatant political retribution, breaking from norms that allow former presidents access to intelligence to support national security continuity. Trump continues to weaponize intelligence access to punish political opponents, a hallmark of authoritarian regimes.Source: ABC NewsRFK Jr. Spreads Vaccine Disinformation Amid Deadly Measles OutbreakWhat Happened: Health Secretary RFK Jr. downplayed the importance of measles vaccinations while promoting debunked health claims in a Fox News interview. He falsely suggested that natural measles immunity prevents cancer and heart disease and raised unproven concerns about vaccine injuries in Texas. His comments come as the measles outbreak is worsening in West Texas, infecting nearly 200 people and killing at least one child\u2014the first U.S. measles death in a decade.Why It Matters: Kennedy is using his official position to spread disinformation and discourage vaccinations amid a public health crisis. His anti-science rhetoric endangers lives, fueling outbreaks of preventable diseases while eroding trust in the medical system.Source: The New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsRFK Jr. Muzzles Cancer Research on Vaccines, Autism, and FluorideWhat Happened: Health Secretary RFK Jr. has imposed strict controls on 23 \u201ccontroversial\u201d topics at the National Cancer Institute, including vaccines, fluoride, autism, and peanut allergies. All related publications and presentations now require special approval, delaying or blocking research publishing.Why It Matters: Kennedy is censoring scientific research to push his anti-vaccine agenda, silencing experts and blocking critical health information. Scientists warn this crackdown will suppress research and endanger public health.Source: ProPublicaCBS Urges FCC to Reject Complaint Over \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Harris InterviewWhat Happened: CBS is pushing back against an FCC complaint accusing the network of news distortion over its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes. The complaint alleges selective editing of her responses, but CBS maintains that editorial discretion is protected under the First Amendment.Why It Matters: Trump has increasingly targeted the media, using federal agencies like the FCC to intimidate and control news coverage. CBS\u2019s response is a broader fight over press freedom and government interference in independent media.Source: ReutersJustice Dept. Official Fired After Opposing Gun Rights Restoration for Mel GibsonWhat Happened: Elizabeth G. Oyer, the Justice Department\u2019s former pardon attorney, was fired after refusing to support restoring Mel Gibson\u2019s gun rights\u2014a move pushed by Trump\u2019s officials. Why It Matters: Trump is prioritizing political loyalty over public safety, using executive power to restore gun rights to convicted domestic abusers. Oyer\u2019s firing sends the message to DOJ and all federal workers that Trump will fire anyone who does not obey his orders.Source: The New York TimesTrump Tightens Grip on GOP, Using Fear and Favor to Enforce LoyaltyWhat Happened: Trump has cemented near-total control over congressional Republicans by mixing personal rewards with veiled threats. GOP lawmakers who fall in line with his agenda receive public praise and political backing, while those who resist face primary threats, online attacks, or political exile. Why It Matters: Trump is gutting Congress\u2019s independence, turning it into a rubber stamp for his agenda. Lawmakers fall in line or face threats, just like in Russia.Source: The New York TimesTop Washington Post columnist quits after piece critical of Bezos is scrappedWhat Happened: Washington Post associate editor Ruth Marcus resigned after her column criticizing Jeff Bezos\u2019s editorial changes was blocked from publication. Why It Matters: The move cements ideological control over The Washington Post and erodes journalistic independence. More than 75,000 subscribers canceled in protest, highlighting fears that Bezos is turning the paper into a partisan mouthpiece.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTexas Bill Seeks to Criminalize Trans IdentityWhat Happened: A proposed Texas bill would make it a felony to identify as transgender on official documents, punishable by up to two years in jail and a $10,000 fine. Another bill aims to ban all gender-affirming care for adults, expanding an existing law that restricts care for minors.Why It Matters: The legislation reflects a growing push to criminalize transgender existence, escalating attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. While unlikely to pass, these bills highlight a dangerous shift toward state-sanctioned discrimination.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Foreign Aid Freeze Cut Off Funds for Severely Malnourished ToddlersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s executive order pausing U.S. foreign aid has forced NGOs to halt life-saving nutrition programs for starving children worldwide. In Afghanistan, Action Against Hunger had to stop accepting new patients at its malnutrition clinics, leaving severely malnourished toddlers without care. Similar aid programs in Haiti, Colombia, and Yemen have also been cut.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s decision is directly endangering vulnerable children and families in crisis zones. Cutting food, medical aid, and shelter support will lead to preventable deaths and worsening humanitarian disasters while damaging U.S. credibility as a global leader.Source: Mother JonesU.S. Added to Global Watchlist for Declining Civic FreedomsWhat Happened: The U.S. has been placed on the Civicus Monitor Watchlist, joining countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan, due to Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on democratic norms. The watchdog cites mass federal firings, the appointment of Trump loyalists, withdrawal from global organizations, and suppression of protests as key reasons for the downgrade.Why It Matters: The U.S. is now internationally recognized as backsliding on civil liberties, marking an unprecedented shift for a country historically seen as a democracy champion. Trump\u2019s authoritarian policies are eroding constitutional freedoms and putting America on a fast track to a dictatorship.Source: The GuardianWorkers remove D.C. Black Lives Matter Plaza mural to avoid funding cutsWhat Happened: Construction crews in Washington, D.C., have begun dismantling the Black Lives Matter mural painted on the street near the White House. The mural, created in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020, had served as a symbol of protest against racial injustice and police brutality.Why It Matters: The removal of the mural marks another step in Trump\u2019s effort to erase symbols of racial justice movements and part of a larger rollback of civil rights initiatives. Source: ReutersU.S. Withdraws from Global Climate Damage Compensation FundWhat Happened: Trump has formally pulled the U.S. out of the Loss and Damage Fund, an international climate finance program designed to compensate poorer nations for the devastating effects of climate change. Why It Matters: The withdrawal denies crucial funding to vulnerable nations suffering from climate disasters caused by industrialized countries\u2019 emissions. It will worsen global climate inequities and damage U.S. credibility in future diplomatic negotiations.Source: Associated PressTrump DOT Chief Eliminates Environmental Justice from Infrastructure DecisionsWhat Happened: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy rescinded Biden-era policies that required state agencies to consider environmental and social justice factors when planning infrastructure projects. The move eliminates previous guidelines that prioritized investments in disadvantaged communities disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change.Why It Matters: This ends efforts to address historical pollution burdens in Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities, and the move will worsen public health outcomes and environmental degradation, especially in areas already facing disproportionate harm from highways and industrial pollution.Source: Associated PressTrump Plans to Restrict Obamacare EnrollmentWhat Happened: Trump is shortening the enrollment period for Obamacare health plans, closing sign-ups on December 15, a month earlier than usual. It is also tightening special enrollment eligibility and income verification requirements while banning coverage for gender-affirming care and barring DACA recipients from enrolling.Why It Matters: These changes will make it harder for millions of Americans\u2014especially low-income individuals and transgender people\u2014to access affordable healthcare. This is part of Trump\u2019s effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without a formal repeal.Source: ReutersMusk and Trump Bash Immigrants While Destroying Programs to Stabilize Their Home CountriesWhat Happened: Trump and Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE operatives are dismantling two small but vital foreign aid agencies\u2014the U.S. African Development Foundation and the Inter-American Foundation \u2014despite their mission to reduce migration to the U.S. and prevent regional instability. Why It Matters: Cutting these programs will worsen poverty, drive more people to flee their home countries, and create the very migration crises Trump claims to oppose. The USADF also plays a role in counterterrorism by preventing recruitment into extremist groups. Source: Mother JonesTrump Threatens 60 Colleges With Antisemitism PenaltiesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime warned 60 universities that they could face penalties over antisemitism investigations, days after cutting $400 million in federal funding from Columbia University and arresting a protest leader. Why It Matters: While combating antisemitism is crucial, Trump is weaponizing federal funding to suppress political dissent on college campuses. The vague definition of \u201cillegal protests\u201d and selective targeting of institutions is setting a precedent for cracking down on broader dissent in the future.Source: The New York TimesICE Arrest of Columbia Student Signals Trump\u2019s Crackdown on Campus ActivismWhat Happened: Homeland Security agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist. The regime claims Khalil engaged in \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d activities, revoking his legal status, while critics call it a political attack on free speech. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown on campus activism marks a new era of government intervention in student politics, with potential deportations and funding cuts for universities. Khalil\u2019s case could set a precedent for broader government action against dissent on U.S. campuses.Source: Wall Street JournalNIH to terminate or limit grants related to vaccine hesitancy and uptakeWhat Happened: The National Institutes of Health abruptly terminated or cut funding for over 40 grants studying vaccine hesitancy and uptake following an internal directive. RFK Jr. also ordered the CDC to re-examine the debunked vaccine-autism link, further legitimizing conspiracy theories.Why It Matters: The decision undermines public health efforts when the measles outbreak is surging and vaccine refusal is rising. Cutting research into why people distrust vaccines will make it harder to combat disinformation and protect communities from preventable diseases. Source: Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchMusk eyes Social Security and benefit programs for cuts while claiming widespread fraudWhat Happened: Elon Musk signaled that Social Security and other entitlement programs would be key targets for cuts, claiming widespread fraud and inefficiencies. In a Fox Business interview, Musk falsely alleged that $500-$700 billion in waste must be eliminated and repeated debunked claims about payments to dead recipients. Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s push to gut Social Security contradicts Republicans\u2019 past promises to protect benefits. His exaggerated fraud claims are being used to justify massive cuts, despite watchdog reports showing minimal waste. With agency closures already underway, millions of Americans could face disruptions to critical benefits.Source: Associated PressUSDA Cuts Over $1 Billion in School and Local Food FundingWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has eliminated two federal programs that provided over $1 billion annually for schools and food banks to purchase from local farms. The cuts affect the $660 million Local Food for Schools program and the $500 million Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which supported food banks.Why It Matters: These cuts will hit schools, food banks, and small farmers hard, worsening food insecurity and disrupting local economies while hurting vulnerable children.Source: ReutersVeterans Betrayed as Trump and Musk Gut VA WorkforceWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are preparing to fire 80,000 Veterans Affairs employees this summer, effectively dismantling the VA\u2019s public healthcare system. The move is part of a broader effort to enrich billionaires at the expense of veterans who rely on these services.Why It Matters: These cuts will devastate veterans who depend on VA healthcare, benefits, and employment. The mass firings will trigger financial crises for countless families, increase veteran homelessness, and lead to a surge in suicides. With no legislative majority to stop it, the destruction of the VA is an outright betrayal of those who served.Source: Rolling StoneWhat Happens to Student Loans If Trump Shuts Down the Education Department?What Happened: Trump is moving forward with plans to shut down the Department of Education, which manages federal student loans for nearly 43 million borrowers. While the department\u2019s closure wouldn\u2019t eliminate student loans, regime officials say the loans would be transferred to another federal agency.Why It Matters: Dismantling the Education Department raises major uncertainties about loan servicing, forgiveness programs, and borrower protections. Without clear oversight, repayment processes could become chaotic, and existing debt relief programs may be weakened or eliminated.Source: USA TodayTrump Targets 30% Payroll Cut at National Park ServiceWhat Happened: Trump is pushing for a 30% payroll reduction at the National Park Service. While not a direct staffing cut, the move is expected to slash park rangers, janitors, and conservation programs, affecting visitor services at Yellowstone, Glacier, and other national parks.Why It Matters: The cuts would cripple park maintenance, reduce visitor safety, and endanger conservation efforts, turning America\u2019s most iconic landscapes into understaffed, poorly maintained tourist traps.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchU.S. Allies Consider Nuclear Weapons as Trump Undermines Global SecurityWhat Happened: As Trump weakens alliances and pivots toward Russia, U.S. allies\u2014including Germany, Poland, and South Korea\u2014are reconsidering nuclear weapons development. France has offered to extend its nuclear umbrella over Europe, but concerns remain about its effectiveness against Russia\u2019s massive arsenal. Meanwhile, South Korea is reportedly closest to pursuing its nuclear program, with Japan likely to follow.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s abandonment of U.S. security commitments is triggering a potential global arms race. If one country begins nuclear development, others will follow, destabilizing international security and increasing the risk of conflict. Nuclear proliferation on this scale could provoke military responses from Russia and China, leading to a new Cold War\u2014or worse.Source: Defense OneGreenland heads to the polls amid Trump\u2019s threats to take overWhat Happened: Greenland\u2019s national elections, typically focused on local governance, have taken on international significance after Trump renewed his push to annex the Arctic territory. His statement\u2014\u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it one way or the other\u201d\u2014has alarmed Greenland\u2019s leaders, who firmly reject U.S. ownership.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed push to annex Greenland signals a dangerous imperialist overreach, directly threatening Greenland\u2019s sovereignty and attacking Denmark, a key NATO ally.Source: Politico EU\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRubio: Ukraine Must Cede Land for Peace, Talks With Russia RequiredWhat Happened: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Ukraine must give up territory as part of any negotiated settlement with Russia. His remarks follow Trump\u2019s decision to cut U.S. military aid and intel sharing to Ukraine.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s demands fall entirely on Ukraine, while Russia faces no conditions. Trump continues to try to extort Ukraine on rare earth minerals while showing fealty to Russia. Trump\u2019s \u201cnegotiations\u201d are to try to force Ukraine to surrender to Russia.Source: The New York TimesU.S. Senator Accuses Trump of Weakening Ukraine\u2019s Defense, Dismisses Musk\u2019s \u2018Traitor\u2019 InsultWhat Happened: Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) criticized Trump\u2019s suspension of intelligence-sharing, stating it has directly weakened Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself against Russian genocidal attacks. During a visit to Kyiv, he confirmed that recent deadly Russian strikes could have been mitigated if Ukraine had access to U.S. intelligence. Musk chimed in, calling Kelly a \u201ctraitor.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump's decision to cut off intelligence-sharing with Ukraine has directly resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, leading to more Russian attacks. Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Break With Ukraine and Europe Sparks Security CrisisWhat Happened: In just three weeks, Trump cut U.S. weapons and intelligence to Ukraine, ambushed and expelled Zelenskyy from the White House, and pushed Europe toward nuclear deterrence, raising fears of military escalation and NATO\u2019s collapse.Why It Matters: Europe is moving toward nuclear deterrence, with France offering its nuclear umbrella and Poland considering its own arsenal. Ukraine\u2019s defenses are crumbling under intensified Russian airstrikes, while NATO's survival is in doubt. Trump continues delivering for Moscow.Source: ReutersTrump Ally Dana White Embraces Accused Sex Traffickers Andrew and Tristan TateWhat Happened: UFC President Dana White welcomed Andrew and Tristan Tate at a Las Vegas event despite their ongoing legal troubles, including human trafficking charges in Romania. A viral video captured White greeting them, \u201cWelcome to the States, boys.\u201dWhy It Matters: White\u2019s warm embrace of these extremist influencers, known for misogynistic rhetoric, is on brand with Trump\u2019s MAGA base. Meanwhile, Florida\u2019s attorney general has opened a preliminary inquiry into the Tate brothers.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Tariff Chaos Wipes Out $4 Trillion in Stock Market ValueWhat Happened: The U.S. stock market has lost $4 trillion in value as Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policies spook investors and drive fears of an economic downturn. The S&P 500 fell 2.7% on Monday, marking its biggest drop of the year, while the Nasdaq plunged 4%, confirming a 10% correction from its December peak.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s back-and-forth trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is destabilizing global markets, undermining corporate confidence, and driving investors away from U.S. equities. The market turmoil signals rising fears of a recession.Source: ReutersTesla Shares Plunge 15%, Suffering Steepest Drop in Five YearsWhat Happened: Tesla stock dropped 15% on Monday, marking its worst single-day decline since 2020. The company has lost over 50% of its value since December, wiping out $800 billion in market cap. The sell-off coincides with Musk\u2019s takeover of the Trump regime.Why It Matters: Tesla\u2019s stock is in freefall as Musk\u2019s political entanglements, Trump\u2019s tariff threats, and growing consumer backlash fuel instability.

The company now expects revenue growth of no more than 5%\u2014down from its earlier estimate of 6-8% \u2014and slashed its earnings outlook by more than half. Why It Matters: The pullback in travel spending signals weakening consumer and corporate confidence in the economy. Delta\u2019s sharp downgrade adds to broader concerns about economic uncertainty under Trump\u2019s erratic policies and recession fears.Source: CNBCChina Hits Back at Trump\u2019s Tariffs With 15% Levies on U.S. FarmersWhat Happened: China has retaliated against Trump\u2019s tariff hikes by imposing a 15% tax on key U.S. agricultural exports, including chicken, pork, soybeans, and beef. The move comes after Trump doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% last week.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs are a blow to American farmers, many of whom rely heavily on exports to China. Source: Associated PressOntario Slaps 25% Tax Increase on U.S. Electricity Exports in Trade War RetaliationWhat Happened: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25% hike in electricity prices for 1.5 million American homes and businesses in Minnesota, New York, and Michigan in response to Trump\u2019s escalating trade war. Ford warned that if Trump increases tariffs further, Ontario could cut off U.S. electricity exports entirely.Why It Matters: This directly impacts American consumers and businesses, escalating economic tensions between the U.S. and Canada. With Trump\u2019s tariffs disrupting supply chains, higher electricity costs could further strain key U.S. industries and lead to broader economic consequences.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsVeterans Nationwide March: March 14, 2025Meet the federal worker who went rogue: \u2018I hope that it lights a fire under people\u2019What Happened: Karen Ortiz, an administrative judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, defied a directive to freeze LGBTQ+ discrimination cases following Trump\u2019s executive order limiting federal recognition to only two sexes.

DHS justified the move by citing Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, allowing them to fast-track the contracts under \\u201Cunusual and compelling urgency\\u201D rules.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Taxpayer money is funding a Trump ad blitz, blurring the line between governance and propaganda.

The reversal, championed by oil billionaire Harold Hamm, shields energy and construction companies from penalties for killing birds during drilling, mining, wind energy production, and construction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The guts accountability for industries responsible for some of the nation\\u2019s worst environmental disasters which killed hundreds of thousands of birds.

The proposed changes would assume that workers handling toxic chemicals wear protective gear, making it harder to classify chemicals as dangerous.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Loosening chemical safety regulations will lead to increased public health risks and reduce accountability for polluters, prioritizing corporate interests over environmental and consumer protections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5187011-trump-considers-easing-safety-screenings-for-chemicals/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Amazon Streams Trump\\u2019s <em>The Apprentice</em> Amid Growing Ties with White House</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Amazon announced it will begin streaming Trump\\u2019s reality show The Apprentice, potentially funneling profits to Trump. The move follows Amazon\\u2019s $1 million donation to Trump\\u2019s inauguration and a $40 million budget for Melania Trump\\u2019s documentary.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The deal highlights corporate cronyism as Jeff Bezos aligns with Trump.

The rushed sale, brokered through insider ties between Larry Fink, Trump officials, and billionaire dealmakers, highlights backroom dealings and corporate favoritism.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This deal hands Wall Street massive control over global trade while rewarding Trump\\u2019s political allies. It highlights the blurred lines between private wealth and government power, as U.S. policy shifts benefit BlackRock\\u2019s empire over national security interests.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/blackrock-panama-canal-deal-trump-a0af7b7d?mod=hp_lead_pos9\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Musk Expands DOGE\\u2019s Grip on Government, Plans to Double Staff</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk announced plans to double his operatives of unauthorized FAKE DOGE to 200 employees, expanding its influence across nearly every federal agency. Musk made clear he isn\\u2019t leaving the government anytime soon, suggesting he may outlast his temporary appointment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk is slashing Social Security, IRS enforcement, and environmental protections while gutting the federal workforce under the guise of \\u201Cefficiency.\\u201D His unchecked power raises constitutional concerns as watchdogs warn of illegal actions and lack of oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/musk-says-doge-almost-every-federal-agency-plans-double-staff-rcna195735\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>It's 'shoot first and ask questions later' as DOGE tries to dismantle CFPB: Official</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A CFPB official testified that Trump\\u2019s FAKE DOGE attempted to fire the majority of the agency\\u2019s workforce and fulfill its legal obligations with a skeleton crew before a judge halted the takeover. Internal chaos ensued as officials scrambled to dismantle and partially reinstate parts of the agency, leading to lost data and disrupted services.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The CFPB was created to protect consumers from predatory financial practices, and its dismantling signals an open season for corporate abuse.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ended $10 million in annual funding to the nonprofit Center for Internet Security. The regime has also disbanded an FBI task force dedicated to investigating foreign influence in U.S. elections.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Cutting election security funding weakens defenses against foreign and domestic interference and cyber threats, increasing the risk of meddling in upcoming elections.

The remaining 18% will be transferred under the State Department\\u2019s control. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> USAID has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for six decades, stabilizing economies, preventing conflict, and strengthening alliances. Its destruction will leave millions without humanitarian aid, weaken U.S. global influence, and create power vacuums for rivals like China and Russia to exploit. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/secretary-state-rubio-purge-usaid-programs-complete-83-119628492\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk and DOGE try to slash government by cutting out those who answer to voters</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump and Musk are making massive cuts to the federal government\\u2014circumventing Congress and elected officials.

This comes as Trump pushes to remove Democratic NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, challenging long-standing rules that shield independent agencies from White House control.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This accelerates Trump\\u2019s effort to consolidate power over independent federal agencies, dismantling traditional checks on presidential authority. By gutting the NLRB\\u2019s independence, Trump is tilting labor policy to benefit corporations and allies like Musk, further eroding worker protections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-labor-board-opts-not-defend-law-barring-trump-firing-democratic-member-2025-03-10/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s IRS Overhaul Guts Enforcement</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has laid off over 7,000 IRS employees, including auditors focused on large businesses and wealthy taxpayers, leaving tax enforcement in disarray. Trump is slashing the agency\\u2019s workforce by up to 50% while installing political loyalists, like former Congressman Billy Long, to take control.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With fewer auditors, wealthy individuals and corporations face less scrutiny, while ordinary taxpayers may struggle to get assistance. Trump and Elon Musk are automating IRS functions, canceling contracts with tech vendors, and asserting unprecedented political control over an agency meant to operate independently.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/us/politics/irs-taxes-trump-musk-federal-workers.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s Team Seized Social Security in a \\u2018Hostile Takeover,\\u2019 Former Official Says</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Musk and his operatives aggressively took control of the Social Security Administration, demanding access to sensitive taxpayer data while ignoring legal safeguards and established security protocols. Musk\\u2019s unvetted operatives, with no government experience, bypassed normal channels and recklessly exposed the private data of millions of Americans.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s unrestricted access to taxpayer data is a major security risk, and his seizing the agency could disrupt Social Security payments for 73 million Americans. With Trump purging SSA leadership and executing mass layoffs, concerns grow over a deliberate effort to dismantle the agency.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/10/musk-social-security-data-doge-trump/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Education Civil Rights Office Redirected to Trump\\u2019s Political Agenda</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Education Department\\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, historically responsible for enforcing disability rights and anti-discrimination laws in schools, has been repurposed under Trump to focus on his political priorities. Pending cases\\u2014including those involving students with disabilities\\u2014were stalled for weeks, while new investigations targeting antisemitism, transgender policies, and DEI programs have surged. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The shift away from traditional civil rights enforcement leaves vulnerable students\\u2014especially those with disabilities\\u2014without crucial protections. Career staff have been sidelined or pressured out, further weakening oversight. Trump\\u2019s weaponization of the OCR highlights his intent to reshape civil rights enforcement to align with his extremist agenda rather than protect students from discrimination.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/education-department-civil-rights-special-education-antisemitism-764c1298a4ba856ce793249cdb57e6d6\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Gabbard Revokes Security Clearances for Trump\\u2019s Political Enemies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stripped security clearances from top Biden officials, prosecutors who worked on Trump cases, and a key whistleblower attorney. Those targeted include Antony Blinken, Jake Sullivan, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, and Mark Zaid, the lawyer behind Trump\\u2019s first impeachment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using security clearances as a political weapon, punishing those who challenged him.

His comments come as the measles outbreak is worsening in West Texas, infecting nearly 200 people and killing at least one child\\u2014the first U.S. measles death in a decade.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Kennedy is using his official position to spread disinformation and discourage vaccinations amid a public health crisis.

The complaint alleges selective editing of her responses, but CBS maintains that editorial discretion is protected under the First Amendment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has increasingly targeted the media, using federal agencies like the FCC to intimidate and control news coverage.

GOP lawmakers who fall in line with his agenda receive public praise and political backing, while those who resist face primary threats, online attacks, or political exile. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is gutting Congress\\u2019s independence, turning it into a rubber stamp for his agenda.

Another bill aims to ban all gender-affirming care for adults, expanding an existing law that restricts care for minors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The legislation reflects a growing push to criminalize transgender existence, escalating attacks on LGBTQ+ rights.
