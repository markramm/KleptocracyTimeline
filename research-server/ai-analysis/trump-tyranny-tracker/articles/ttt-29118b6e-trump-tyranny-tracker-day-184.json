The order would also turn key FAA roles into political appointments and override state environmental oversight.Why It Matters: This is a massive gift to the private space industry at the expense of public safety and the environment. Trump is letting billionaires like Musk rewrite launch rules\u2014gutting safeguards and stripping states of control over their coastlines.Source: ProPublicaMusk's xAI was a late addition to the Pentagon\u2019s set of $200 million AI contracts, former defense employee saysWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s xAI was quietly included in a Pentagon AI program worth up to $800 million, despite not being listed as of March. The move followed public backlash over antisemitic content from its chatbot Grok and sexualized AI avatars.Why It Matters: The decision highlights political favoritism and national security.

The GAO has 46 open probes and is considering a lawsuit against the regime for defying spending laws.Why It Matters: By gutting the GAO and blocking its investigations, Trump is trying to rewrite the Constitution\u2019s budget process and consolidate control of federal funds\u2014turning oversight into a political casualty.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDOJ fires newly appointed US attorney in NJ after judges vote against keeping Alina Habba in roleWhat Happened: The Justice Department removed U.S. Attorney Desiree Leigh Grace right after New Jersey judges appointed her, rejecting an extension for Trump ally Alina Habba. AG Pam Bondi accused the court of \u201cthreatening the President\u2019s core powers.\u201dWhy It Matters: The firing shows Trump\u2019s DOJ punishing prosecutors who don\u2019t pass loyalty tests. It\u2019s a direct assault on judicial independence and a warning to courts that defying Trump\u2019s will has consequences.Source: CNN2,000 National Guard troops expected to be called up to assist at ICE detention facilities, sources sayWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to send up to 2,000 National Guard troops from 20 states to assist ICE at detention centers. Under Title 32 status, troops will support operations like fingerprinting and mouth swabbing while skirting legal bans on military involvement in law enforcement.Why It Matters: This accelerates the militarization of immigration enforcement. It normalizes troop presence in civilian detention and sets the stage for DHS\u2019s long-term goal of deploying 20,000 troops nationwide.Source: CNNJustice Dept. Reaches Out to Ghislaine Maxwell, a Longtime Epstein AssociateWhat Happened: The Justice Department contacted Ghislaine Maxwell about \u201ccooperating\u201d in the Epstein case after criticism over refusing to release the files. Deputy AG Todd Blanche said Trump personally ordered the move. Maxwell\u2019s lawyer thanked Trump and said she\u2019s willing to testify.Why It Matters: Trump is turning to a convicted sex trafficker to deflect scrutiny over his decades-long Epstein ties\u2014in hopes of testimony that serves his interests. It reeks of quid pro quo: pardon or a shorter prison sentence in exchange for a narrative that clears Trump.Source: New York TimesUS House calls early summer recess to block voting on release of Epstein filesWhat Happened: House Republicans abruptly ended the legislative week a day early, blocking Democrats from forcing a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s full case files. Speaker Mike Johnson claimed the move was to protect victims, while critics say it\u2019s a cover for shielding Trump and suppressing damaging information.Why It Matters: GOP leaders are cutting off debate, stonewalling transparency, and protecting Trump amid growing pressure over his ties to Epstein. The public deserves answers\u2014not recess games.Source: The GuardianTrump's intelligence chiefs try to rewrite the history of the 2016 electionWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe claim Obama officials \u201cconspired\u201d to exaggerate Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. Gabbard called the intel report \u201ctreasonous\u201d and referred it for investigation, despite years of bipartisan confirmation that Putin helped Trump win.Why It Matters: This is political revisionism designed to shield Trump, discredit critics, and distract from Epstein scrutiny. It also sets the stage for persecuting political opponents by rewriting history to justify future prosecutions.Source: NBC NewsCheck out my latest on this\u2026Unmasking RussiaFrom Campaign Rhetoric to Fascist Threats: Trump Targets Obama While much of the political and media class continues to brush off Trump\u2019s renewed threats to arrest Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Adam Schiff, and a long list of former government and intelligence officials as deflection from Epstein, those of us who have spent years observing autocratic regimes, intelligence weaponization, a\u2026Read morea month ago \u00b7 36 likes \u00b7 8 comments \u00b7 Olga LautmanAt least three Trump advisers set to visit Fed on ThursdayWhat Happened: At least 3 top Trump officials\u2014James Blair, Russell Vought, and Bill Pulte\u2014are visiting the Fed Thursday to scrutinize its $2.5 billion renovation. The visit is part of a coordinated push to pressure Chair Jerome Powell, with Trump using the project to build a case for his removal.Why It Matters: The visit escalates Trump\u2019s effort to politicize the Fed and lay the groundwork to fire Powell. Using a renovation as a pretext threatens central bank independence\u2014and will destabilize markets just to tighten Trump\u2019s grip on economic power.Source: SemaforUnder Trump, Border Patrol arrests immigrants far from U.S.-Mexico borderWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Border Patrol is carrying out aggressive immigration sweeps far from the border\u2014in cities like L.A., New York, and Sacramento\u2014raiding parks, farms, and courthouses under a 100-mile jurisdiction rule. Agents are accused of targeting people based on appearance and using military-style tactics.Why It Matters: This is a major expansion of Trump\u2019s deportation machine and racial profiling on steroids. Border Patrol is now operating deep in the U.S. interior, bypassing constitutional safeguards and normalizing militarized raids against immigrant communities.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s border czar to target sanctuary cities in US: \u2018We\u2019re gonna flood the zone\u2019What Happened: Tom Homan pledged to \u201cflood the zone\u201d with ICE agents in cities like New York after an off-duty officer was shot. He blamed Democratic mayors for \u201charboring criminals\u201d and promised mass arrests.Why It Matters: Trump is using a single tragedy to justify broad crackdowns\u2014criminalizing immigrant communities and weaponizing fear. The real goal isn\u2019t safety but to strip states and cities of their autonomy and force them to submit to federal control.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Labor Department proposes more than 60 rule changes in a push to deregulate workplacesWhat Happened: The Labor Department unveiled plans to roll back over 60 workplace regulations. The changes would strip wage protections, safety rules, and oversight across industries\u2014from home care and mining to construction and entertainment.Why It Matters: This is a sweeping attack on labor protections. Millions of low-wage, minority, and immigrant workers will face lower pay and a greater risk of injury.Source: Associated PressLouisville Drops \u2018Sanctuary City\u2019 Policy Over Fear of Retribution From TrumpWhat Happened: Louisville\u2019s Democratic mayor reversed the city\u2019s sanctuary policy, agreeing to detain immigrants for ICE up to 48 hours after DOJ threats of mass raids and lost federal funding if the city didn\u2019t comply.Why It Matters: This is extortion. Trump is using federal power to coerce cities into backing his mass deportation agenda, forcing local leaders to choose between community safety and political survival.Source: NOTUSTrump widens probes into Virginia\u2019s largest public universityWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ opened a fourth federal probe into George Mason University, now scrutinizing admissions and student benefits. Earlier investigations targeted hiring practices and alleged antisemitism. Critics say the real aim is to remove DEI-supporting President Gregory Washington.Why It Matters: This is about enforcing ideological conformity. Trump is using federal power to intimidate universities into dropping DEI programs and punishing those who resist. Today it\u2019s DEI\u2014tomorrow it could be academic freedom, control over curriculum, climate science, or LGBTQ rights.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump claims new CBS owner will gift him $20m worth of airtime after $16m settlementWhat Happened: Days after CBS canceled Stephen Colbert\u2019s show, Trump claimed the network\u2019s future owner would give him $20 million in ads and programming. This follows a $16 million settlement over a CBS interview with Kamala Harris that Trump targeted with a sham lawsuit. CBS\u2019s buyer, Skydance, is backed by pro-Trump billionaire Larry Ellison.Why It Matters: Trump is using legal pressure to extract media concessions. If true, the deal amounts to a massive in-kind campaign gift from a major network\u2014blurring lines between corporate media and authoritarian propaganda.Source: The GuardianFrustration and fear ripple through NPR and PBS affiliates after Congress approves clawbacksWhat Happened: Congress approved Trump\u2019s demand to slash $1.1 billion from public broadcasting, leaving rural NPR and PBS stations facing layoffs, service cuts, and possible shutdowns. Many rely on federal grants for over half their funding and say they can\u2019t cover the gap.Why It Matters: Trump is defunding rural public media as part of his war on the press\u2014threatening local news, education, and emergency alerts in communities that depend on them.Source: PoliticoDemocrats say GOP 'snuck in' renaming Kennedy Center Opera House for Melania TrumpWhat Happened: House Republicans passed a surprise amendment to rename the Kennedy Center\u2019s Opera House after Melania Trump, slipping it into a spending bill with no public debate. Democrats condemned the move as politicizing a national arts institution.Why It Matters: Trump is hijacking public institutions to glorify his brand\u2014just as autocrats do in Russia. By bypassing norms and installing loyalists, he\u2019s turning cultural landmarks into monuments to his own political ego and attempting to rewrite the national identity in his own image.Source: ABC NewsRevealed: Harvard publisher cancels entire journal issue on Palestine shortly before publicationWhat Happened: Harvard\u2019s publisher abruptly scrapped a forthcoming Harvard Educational Review issue on Palestine, despite finalized contracts and peer-reviewed articles. The decision followed pressure to conduct a legal \u201crisk assessment\u201d over fears of antisemitism claims amid Trump\u2019s war on higher ed and pro-Palestinian speech.Why It Matters: The cancellation reflects rising authoritarian pressure on U.S. universities, where politically sensitive topics are now subject to legal intimidation, internal suppression, and the erosion of scholarly freedom.Source: The GuardianEverything Is a \u2018False Flag\u2019 NowWhat Happened: Online conspiracy theories about \u201cfalse flag\u201d attacks have exploded\u2014fueled by Trump allies claiming everything from floods to shootings are staged to distract from Epstein. Research shows a 1,100% spike in \u201cfalse flag\u201d mentions on X, often laced with antisemitism and driven by far-right influencers like Stew Peters.Why It Matters: We\u2019ve entered a post-truth era where every major event is dismissed as fake. This isn\u2019t just disinformation\u2014it\u2019s dehumanizing. Real victims are erased, institutions are dismantled, and the far right gains power by casting reality itself as a hoax.Source: WIREDColumbia Punishes Dozens of Student Protesters as It Caves to TrumpWhat Happened: Columbia University suspended, placed on probation, or threatened to expel over 70 students involved in a pro-Palestinian teach-in, following federal pressure tied to $400 million in withheld grants. Some students were arrested or injured and told to apologize to avoid harsher penalties.Why It Matters: This is political censorship in action. Under Trump\u2019s pressure, Columbia is punishing protest and free speech\u2014turning federal funding into a weapon to silence dissent and crush student activism.Source: The New Republic\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsMilitary Says It Will \u2018Continuously\u2019 Monitor Bathrooms to Comply With Anti-Trans OrderWhat Happened: The Pentagon\u2019s 19-page memo outlines strict enforcement of Trump\u2019s anti-trans order, including bathroom surveillance and censorship of Stars and Stripes. At least 69 employees were suspended over alleged \u201cgender ideology.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is more institutionalized discrimination. The military is now enforcing ideology through surveillance and press control\u2014hallmarks of authoritarian governance.Source: 404 MediaU.S. deportees, freed from Salvadoran prison, describe \u2018horror movie\u2019What Happened: 3 Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. were secretly imprisoned for months in El Salvador\u2019s gulag, despite no charges or gang ties. They were reportedly beaten, denied care, and barred from legal access\u2014until a Venezuela-U.S. prisoner swap secured their release.Why It Matters: Trump outsourced torture, paying $6 million to hold migrants in a foreign black site. By bypassing U.S. laws through secret deals with Bukele\u2019s regime, it is carrying out human rights crimes against vulnerable deportees.Source: Washington PostAttorneys for wrongly deported Venezuelan asylum seeker will seek criminal contempt proceedings after prisoner swapWhat Happened: Lawyers for a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker are urging a judge to hold Trump officials in contempt after he was illegally deported to El Salvador\u2019s gulag\u2014despite a court order. The migrant was later included in a prisoner swap with Venezuela.Why It Matters: Trump brazenly violated a judge\u2019s order, weaponizing deportation to use migrants as diplomatic leverage. This case underscores how asylum rights and court rulings are being ignored in pursuit of political deals.Source: CNNDetainees held at Alligator Alcatraz describe cage-like units swarmed by mosquitoesWhat Happened: Immigrant detainees at Florida\u2019s Alligator Alcatraz internment camp describe being crammed into cage-like tents, denied basic hygiene, and fed only once daily. Lawsuits from ACLU and Human Rights Watch cite systemic abuse, medical neglect, and blocked legal access.Why It Matters: This is institutionalized cruelty and a flagrant violation of human rights. Trump\u2019s mass detention push is turning state-run internment camps into sites of suffering and abuse\u2014while DHS denies anything is wrong. Source: NBC NewsTrump can lift deportation protections for thousands from Afghanistan and Cameroon, court saysWhat Happened: A federal appeals court allowed Trump to end TPS for over 10,000 Afghans and Cameroonians, despite legal challenges. The court said CASA\u2019s lawsuit can proceed, but refused to block the policy.Why It Matters: The decision puts thousands at risk of deportation to countries the U.S. itself warns are unsafe. Many Afghans facing removal risked their lives serving alongside U.S. forces and will be returned to execution. Source: CBS NewsVideos reveal harsh conditions inside Ice\u2019s New York City confinement centerWhat Happened: Leaked footage shows dozens of detained migrants sleeping on the floor near toilets inside a makeshift ICE holding area on the 10th floor of Manhattan\u2019s 26 Federal Plaza. ICE claims the site is only a \u201cprocessing center,\u201d not subject to federal oversight, but detainees describe being held for days without food, medicine, or beds.Why It Matters: By rebranding detention centers as \"processing sites,\" ICE is evading transparency laws while subjecting people to inhumane conditions\u2014just blocks from immigration court.Source: The GuardianWife of asylum-seeker speaks on detention center's conditions: \"He did not deserve any of this\"What Happened: A video from the New York Immigration Coalition shows asylum-seekers packed into ICE cells, sleeping on floors under constant light, with one toilet for 30 men. Joan Alcivar De La Cruz was arrested at his asylum hearing and denied liver medication; his U.S. citizen wife suffered a miscarriage from the stress.Why It Matters: This is what Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown looks like: legal asylum-seekers detained in inhumane conditions and denied life-saving care. ICE\u2019s tactics are destroying families and violating basic human rights.Source: CBS News3 US Marine Brothers Faced Toughest Mission: Getting Their Dad Freed from ICE CustodyWhat Happened: Narciso Barranco, an undocumented landscaper in California with three U.S. Marine sons, was violently arrested by masked ICE agents while working. Despite 30 years in the U.S. and marriage to a citizen, Barranco was pepper-sprayed, beaten, and detained for 24 days during Trump\u2019s mass immigration crackdown.Why It Matters: This case exposes the cruelty and absurdity of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Racial profiling, private prisons, and brutal enforcement tactics are destroying working-class immigrant households\u2014no matter their service or sacrifice.Source: Military.comU.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee says sports must comply with Trump's order on transgender athletesWhat Happened: The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee told all national sports federations they must comply with Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports. Why It Matters: This is a sweeping rollback of civil rights. Trump is forcing compliance through funding threats, politicizing athletics to erase transgender people from public life and institutional structures\u2014starting with sports.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchLabor Department looking to lighten workplace regulation with sweeping rules changes and repealsWhat Happened: The Labor Department unveiled a sweeping plan to repeal or rewrite over 60 workplace safety and wage rules. The changes target minimum wage protections for home health aides and people with disabilities, weaken safeguards for construction and mine workers, and strip migrant farmworkers of anti-retaliation and transportation protections.Why It Matters: This is the biggest assault on worker protections in decades. The Trump regime is prioritizing deregulation over safety, exposing millions\u2014especially women, immigrants, and low-wage laborers\u2014to greater risk of injury, wage theft, and exploitation.

Unauthorized DOGE purges, early retirements, and resignations have gutted the agency as more than 1 million acres burn across 10 states.Why It Matters: As fire season intensifies, critical firefighting jobs remain unfilled, putting lives and property at risk. Internal memos reveal desperation behind the scenes\u2014even requesting HR staff to fight fires.Source: ProPublicaEfforts to shrink Social Security's phone wait times are putting a strain elsewhereWhat Happened: To cut wait times on the overwhelmed 800 number, Trump officials reassigned field office staff\u2014crippling in-person services and triggering more resignations. Over 4,600 SSA workers have left since March.Why It Matters: Trump cuts have gutted SSA, and the patchwork fix is breaking the system further\u2014leaving millions without timely access to vital benefits.Source: NPRThe government was once a steady partner for nonprofits. That\u2019s changingWhat Happened: Trump has frozen or slashed grants for nonprofits nationwide, dismantling decades of federal support for housing, food aid, health care, and more. Nonprofits now face mass layoffs, shuttered programs, and funding gaps that private donors can\u2019t fill.Why It Matters: This is the unraveling of the American safety net. Without government backing, millions will lose critical services\u2014and nonprofits say the damage will be catastrophic and permanent if cuts continue.Source: Associated PressHealth experts warn Trump cuts to the CDC could hurt overdose prevention: \u2018A step backwards\u2019What Happened: Trump officials have frozen $140 million in CDC funding meant for overdose surveillance and prevention, jeopardizing the Overdose Data to Action program. States like Illinois, California, and Maryland warn that the cuts will force layoffs, reduce drug monitoring, and slash treatment access.Why It Matters: Experts say Trump is kneecapping lifesaving overdose response efforts, especially in hard-hit areas that helped elect him. With opioid deaths still a crisis, pulling funding now is deadly.Source: The GuardianIRS has lost 25% of its IT workforce since Trump took office, watchdog findsWhat Happened: A Treasury watchdog report reveals the IRS has lost a quarter of its workforce since Trump took office\u2014including nearly 50 top IT execs and major cuts to audits, taxpayer services, and hiring.Why It Matters: By gutting the IRS, Trump is crippling tax enforcement and oversight, just as efforts to audit the wealthy were gaining ground\u2014opening the door to abuse and inequality.Source: FedScoopA Top NASA Official Is Among Thousands of Staff Leaving the AgencyWhat Happened: Makenzie Lystrup, head of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, will step down August 1, joining thousands leaving the agency amid Trump\u2019s proposed 25% NASA budget cut. Her exit follows that of JPL\u2019s director and coincides with a staff revolt over safety risks, wasted resources, and political interference.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s budget will gut NASA\u2019s science programs, cancel dozens of missions, and trigger a historic brain drain. The agency\u2019s top talent is fleeing as political appointees push retirements and dismantle America\u2019s leadership in space exploration.Source: WIRED\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchState Department attacks Europe over free speechWhat Happened: Trump officials slammed Europe\u2019s Digital Services Act as \u201cOrwellian,\u201d accusing the EU of \u201ccensoring\u201d dissent and shielding leaders from criticism. In a public post, the State Department claimed thousands are being prosecuted for political speech and warned, \u201cCensorship is not freedom.\u201dWhy It Matters: While attacking Europe\u2019s regulations, the Trump regime is intensifying its own surveillance of foreigners\u2019 speech and punishing dissent at home. The hypocrisy reveals a broader authoritarian strategy: defend \u201cfree speech\u201d abroad while crushing it domestically.Source: PoliticoTrump pulling U.S. out of UNESCO, the U.N. scientific and cultural agency, 2 years after Biden rejoinedWhat Happened: Trump is withdrawing the U.S. from UNESCO, claiming the U.N. cultural agency promotes \"woke, divisive\" causes. The move reverses Biden\u2019s 2023 reentry and follows a 90-day review ordered by Trump. It\u2019s the second time Trump has exited the agency, having first done so in 2017.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s withdrawal from UNESCO is part of a wider push to sever U.S. ties with global institutions. It weakens international cooperation on education, culture, and extremism\u2014and reiterates his open hostility to diversity and diplomacy.Source: CBS NewsStop playing nice with Trump on trade, France tells BrusselsWhat Happened: France is demanding the EU adopt a tougher stance in stalled trade talks with Trump, warning that yielding to U.S. threats of 30% tariffs would project weakness. Macron\u2019s team is urging Brussels to prepare countermeasures and reject any deal \u201cat any price.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff threats are splintering Europe\u2019s response, with Germany seeking compromise and France pushing confrontation. If the EU caves, it could cement Trump\u2019s dominance over transatlantic trade\u2014and encourage more economic bullying.Source: Politico\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchDid Christian Nationalist Leaders Prompt Mike Johnson\u2019s Epstein Flip-Flop?What Happened: House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly reversed course on releasing Epstein files\u2014just a week after saying \u201cput everything out there.\u201d Now, he says Trump needs \u201cspace\u201d and that Congress isn\u2019t at that point \u201cyet.\u201dWhy It Matters: Johnson\u2019s reversal reflects growing influence from Christian nationalist leaders like Lance Wallnau and Joel Webbon, who push Trump loyalty and wild conspiracies about Epstein, Mossad, and \u201cdemonic\u201d enemies. With ties to the New Apostolic Reformation, Johnson may be letting religious extremists steer decisions on truth and accountability.Source: Mother JonesNewsmax host tries to rehabilitate Newsmax board member Alex Acosta\u2019s sweetheart plea deal for EpsteinWhat Happened: Newsmax host Greg Kelly downplayed Alex Acosta\u2019s infamous plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein, denied it was a \u201csweetheart deal,\u201d and smeared journalist Julie K. Brown as \u201cfake news.\u201d Kelly also questioned whether Ghislaine Maxwell deserved her sentence and implied Epstein\u2019s crimes were too old to matter.Why It Matters: This is a blatant attempt to whitewash one of the worst sex traffickers\u2014by a network whose board includes Acosta, the prosecutor who let Epstein walk. Kelly\u2019s attack on the journalist who exposed Epstein makes clear the MAGA movement\u2019s real priority is shielding power, not protecting victims.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsU.S. Mid-Atlantic Factory Activity Contracts at Fastest Rate This YearWhat Happened: Manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic collapsed in July, with the Richmond Fed\u2019s index plunging to -20\u2014the sharpest contraction of 2025. New orders, shipments, and employment all dropped as trade turmoil and economic uncertainty rattled firms.Why It Matters: This marks five straight months of decline, underscoring the toll Trump\u2019s tariff war and erratic trade policy are taking on U.S. industry. Factories are freezing hiring and production amid mounting instability, raising fresh recession alarms.Source: Wall Street JournalCar makers are feeling tariff pain: GM is the 2nd company to take a hit to profitsWhat Happened: GM\u2019s quarterly profits took a $1.1 billion hit due to Trump\u2019s tariffs, dropping its profit margin from 9% to 6.1%. The company admitted it\u2019s only offsetting a fraction of the $4\u20135 billion annual tariff burden and is still importing cars from Korea despite a 25% tariff.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic trade war is hurting U.S. automakers.
