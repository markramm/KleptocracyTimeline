From ending Biden\u2019s LNG pause to gutting climate rules, Trump has supercharged the fossil fuel industry\u2019s profits while dismantling environmental safeguards.Why It Matters: This is a textbook case of pay-to-play politics. Trump\u2019s energy policies are enriching his biggest donors while slashing renewable energy investments, environmental protections, and climate oversight. Deregulation, tax loopholes, and fossil fuel-friendly appointments are transforming the federal government into a vehicle for oil and gas profiteering.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsRetired General Slams Trump\u2019s Military Deployment in L.A. as \u201cMadness\u201dWhat Happened: Retired Brig. Gen. Greg Smith condemned Trump\u2019s decision to deploy Marines and federalize the California National Guard during immigration protests in Los Angeles\u2014without Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s approval. Smith, a 35-year Guard veteran, called it \u201cmadness\u201d and warned the military is being politicized to enforce a partisan agenda.Why It Matters: Smith warns this is a dangerous abuse of executive power that bypasses state authority and risks violating the Posse Comitatus Act. He calls for urgent reform of the Insurrection Act to prevent future presidents from unilaterally using military force against civilians under vague pretexts.Source: Mother JonesThe Trump Crackdown on Elected OfficialsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DHS and ICE are arresting Democratic lawmakers and staffers tied to immigration protests and oversight. Targets include Sen. Padilla, Rep. McIver, Brad Lander, and a Nadler aide\u2014 on flimsy charges contradicted by video.Why It Matters: More political retaliation and an authoritarian crackdown on dissent and opposition. Trump is weaponizing law enforcement to silence critics as he pushes a $75 billion mass deportation plan. Source: The New Yorker\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDHS Imposes New Restrictions on Lawmakers Visiting ICE FacilitiesWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security issued new guidelines requiring a 72-hour notice for congressional visits to ICE detention centers and barring access to ICE field offices entirely. The policy also limits lawmakers' contact with detainees and bans photography, citing \u201coperational concerns and privacy.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a direct assault on congressional oversight and transparency. Democrats say Trump is trying to hide the true impact of his immigration crackdown and silence scrutiny. Congress\u2019s job is oversight\u2014and they must be free to do it.Source: The HillTrump Tightens Social Media Vetting for Foreign Students Applying for U.S. VisasWhat Happened: Trump has ordered U.S. missions abroad to resume student visa appointments with strict new vetting rules requiring applicants to make their social media profiles public and undergo broad online background checks. Officers are instructed to flag political activism\u2014especially criticism of U.S. policy or support for Palestine\u2014as grounds for denial.Why It Matters: The policy targets international students for surveillance and punishes political expression, raising major free speech concerns. This is part of Trump\u2019s wider assault on dissent, freedom of speech, and academic freedom.Source: ReutersThe U.S. Elected Officials Who Have Been Arrested or Approached by Authorities While Protesting Trump\u2019s Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: Democratic officials\u2014including Sen. Padilla, NYC Comptroller Lander, Newark Mayor Baraka, and Rep. McIver\u2014have been arrested, assaulted, or indicted for protesting Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Even Judge Hannah Dugan faces charges for allegedly aiding an undocumented defendant.Why It Matters: Trump is targeting elected officials who oppose him, turning dissent into a punishable offense. This is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes\u2014used in Russia to silence opposition\u2014and now unfolding in the U.S. as lawmakers face state retaliation.Source: TIME2,000 More National Guard Troops Deployed What Happened: The Pentagon deployed an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Trump\u2019s orders, bringing the total to over 4,800 personnel. The move, made under Title 10 authority typically reserved for rebellion or invasion, comes amid ongoing protests and legal battles over Trump\u2019s ability to deploy federal troops without state consent.Why It Matters: The deployment is political theater and a direct attack on state sovereignty. California officials warn it guts disaster response and sets a dangerous precedent. LA is the test case\u2014Trump is conditioning Americans to accept military in the streets as law enforcement. This is how police states begin.Source: NBC NewsICE seeks proprietary data and tech to monitor up to a million peopleWhat Happened: ICE is hiring a private firm to surveil up to 1 million people or entities using tools like social media tracking, blockchain analysis, license plate readers, and dark web monitoring\u2014all to flag potential \u201cthreats\u201d before crimes occur.Why It Matters: This marks a sweeping expansion of domestic surveillance. Civil liberties experts warn it could bypass constitutional protections and target people for their politics, not crimes. It\u2019s pre-crime policing\u2014run by private intelligence firms with zero accountability.Source: FedScoop and Statement of ObjectivesDemocratic lawmakers press USDA for answers on sensitive data collectionWhat Happened: 35 Democratic lawmakers are demanding answers from USDA over a Trump-ordered plan to collect personal data\u2014names, SSNs, addresses, and citizenship\u2014on millions of SNAP recipients, a move pushed by Musk\u2019s operatives to flag \u201cfraud.\u201dWhy It Matters: Surveillance disguised as reform and is part of Trump\u2019s broader plan to monitor and intimidate poor and immigrant communities, while shredding privacy protections and turning safety net programs into tools of control.Source: NPRHegseth Suggests He\u2019d Ignore Court Ruling on LA Troop DeploymentWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth told senators he may not follow a federal court order blocking Trump\u2019s use of troops in Los Angeles, saying only the Supreme Court matters. He sparred with Democrats over protester arrests, military base renamings, and his defense of a press secretary who spread antisemitic conspiracy theories.Why It Matters: Hegseth\u2019s comments show open defiance of judicial authority, deepening fears of a constitutional crisis as Trump\u2019s Pentagon prioritizes loyalty over law.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsVA Removes Anti-Discrimination Protections for Politics and Marital StatusWhat Happened: The Department of Veterans Affairs revised hospital rules to eliminate protections against discrimination based on political views, marital status, and union activity, citing compliance with Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201cbiological truth.\u201d The changes took effect without consulting VA doctors.Why It Matters: This paves the way for denying care to LGBTQ+ vets and politically outspoken staff. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s push to politicize healthcare, purge dissent, and control medical decisions\u2014just like he did with science agencies.Source: The GuardianAuthorities Probe Anonymous Pizza Deliveries to Lawmakers, Capitol Police LeadersWhat Happened: Federal authorities are investigating anonymous pizza deliveries sent to the homes of U.S. lawmakers from both parties and U.S. Capitol Police leadership. Officials believe the deliveries may be intended to intimidate recipients by signaling knowledge of their home addresses.Why It Matters: The incidents come amid a rise in political violence and threats, including a recent shooting that assassinated a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. Lawmakers and security officials fear the pizzas may be a warning tactic echoing past violent attacks on public officials.Source: ABC NewsObama warns US 'dangerously close' to losing democracy\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJudge Strikes Down Biden-Era Rule Protecting Abortion PrivacyWhat Happened: Trump-appointed Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk voided a Biden-era rule that barred healthcare providers from sharing abortion and gender care records with law enforcement, claiming HHS exceeded its authority. The rule had been designed to shield patients from prosecution in states with strict abortion bans.Why It Matters: The ruling delivers a major blow to medical privacy protections in the post-Roe era, giving conservative states broader power to criminalize reproductive and gender-affirming care. Source: ReutersCAUGHT ON CAMERA: U.S. Citizen Detained During ICE Traffic StopWhat Happened: Jose Castro, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was forcibly removed from his truck by ICE and CBP agents in Rochester, NY, during a raid caught on video. Castro repeatedly asserted his citizenship and asked to see a warrant, which agents failed to present before smashing his window. He was later released without explanation.Why It Matters: This is yet another disturbing example of American citizens being swept up in Trump\u2019s aggressive deportation dragnet. Constitutional rights are being trampled in broad daylight as federal agents escalate warrantless searches and racial profiling in immigrant communities.Source: 13WHAM NewsIce agents detain US citizen as LA immigration raids continue: \u2018It\u2019s racial profiling\u2019What Happened: ICE agents raided a Santa Fe Springs swap meet, detaining two people and questioning others based on appearance. In Montebello, they harassed and detained two U.S. citizens, demanding proof of birth. Community leaders say this is blatant racial profiling.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown continues sweeping up American citizens, using race-based raids that ignore warrants and civil rights. Immigrant communities are living in fear as LA turns into a militarized zone.Source: The GuardianTrump Will End L.G.B.T.Q. Suicide Prevention ServiceWhat Happened: Trump abruptly shut down the 988 suicide hotline\u2019s LGBTQ+ support line, effective July 17. The Trevor Project confirmed it was ordered to stop work, ending specialized help for hundreds of thousands of at-risk callers.Why It Matters: This is a cruel and calculated move targeting a vulnerable group. Amid rising anti-LGBTQ+ laws, cutting life-saving support puts lives at risk.Source: New York TimesA Veteran Was Detained by Marines. It Highlights Concerns over the Military's Growing Ties to Law EnforcementWhat Happened: Army veteran Marcos Leao was zip-tied and detained by U.S. Marines in Los Angeles after crossing caution tape near a federal building while trying to reach a VA office. Legal experts say the incident likely violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars military involvement in civilian law enforcement.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s first known Marine detention on U.S. soil was an Army veteran trying to get to a VA appointment. That says everything about the reckless and dangerous use of a marine battalion in LA.Source: Military.com\u2018Abducted by Ice\u2019: the haunting missing-person posters plastered across LAWhat Happened: Hand-drawn \u201cMissing\u201d posters have appeared across Los Angeles, spotlighting immigrants disappeared by ICE raids. Created by local artists, they name deported residents and accuse ICE of abductions without due process, amid a militarized federal crackdown.Why It Matters: These haunting posters expose the human cost of Trump\u2019s mass deportation. While the regime floods LA with troops and propaganda, communities are fighting back with art, grief, and defiance.Source: The GuardianSupreme Court Upholds State Ban on Gender-Affirming Care for Trans YouthWhat Happened: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a state law banning certain gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender minors, allowing restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy to stand.Why It Matters: The decision marks a major setback for trans rights and sets a national precedent allowing states to restrict access to gender-affirming care for youth. It opens the door for further legislative crackdowns and limits legal avenues for challenging such bans.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchNavigating Iran crisis, Trump relies on experience over star powerWhat Happened: Trump is weighing U.S. strikes on Iran and ignoring Hegseth and Gabbard, who\u2019ve fallen out of favor. Instead, he\u2019s relying on a tighter group\u2014Vance, Rubio, Ratcliffe, and Gen. Caine.Why It Matters: Trump is making war decisions with almost no guardrails. As he purged experts and the NSC, a shrinking inner circle of loyalists is steering the U.S. through its most dangerous Middle East crisis in decades.Source: Washington PostState Dept. has \"no announcement\" about helping Americans evacuate Israel after embassy said it was organizing flightsWhat Happened: The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem announced evacuation plans for Americans trapped in Israel, but the State Department quickly walked it back, saying there were no such plans yet. Meanwhile, Trump hinted at striking Iran as war escalates.Why It Matters: This is a total failure of the U.S. government to protect its own citizens. While Trump plays war games, Americans are stranded in a war zone with no clear plan for evacuation or support.Source: CBS NewsSocial Security Trust Fund to Run Dry by 2033 Without Congressional ActionWhat Happened: A new report warns Social Security\u2019s trust fund will run dry by 2033 triggering a 23% benefit cut for over 60 million Americans unless Congress acts. The drop is tied to expanded benefits and declining birth and wage trends. Meanwhile, Trump conitnues to purge the agency\u2019s staff.Why It Matters: America\u2019s top safety net is hurtling toward crisis while Republicans gut the agency and block new revenue. Source: NPRTrump Travel Restrictions Bar Residents Needed at U.S. HospitalsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s expanded travel bans and visa delays have blocked at least 1,000 foreign medical residents from entering the U.S., jeopardizing care at safety-net hospitals that rely on international doctors. The suspension of J-1 visa interviews and new \u201cenhanced vetting\u201d has left residency programs scrambling weeks before the July 1 start date.Why It Matters: Hospitals across the country are bracing for staff shortages that will hit poor and rural communities the hardest. Trump\u2019s crackdown is gutting the frontline medical workforce and turning a public health lifeline into collateral damage.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Considers U.S. Attack on Iran, Demands \u2018Unconditional Surrender\u2019What Happened: Trump is weighing whether to launch U.S. strikes on Iran as the Israel-Iran war enters its second week. Trump shifted his tone, warning Tehran of \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d and claiming U.S. forces have \u201ccomplete control of the skies over Iran.\u201dSource: TIMETrump Privately Approved of Iran Strike Plans, Withholds Final OrderWhat Happened: Trump has approved plans for a military strike on Iran but is withholding the final order, hoping pressure will force Tehran to abandon its nuclear program. Israel\u2019s air campaign has hit over 1,100 targets, and the U.S. has deployed F-22s, warships, and tankers in preparation. A potential strike on Iran\u2019s fortified Fordow site is under consideration.Why It Matters: Trump is gambling with war. An attack would trigger massive retaliation in the region and potentially in the U.S., endanger 40,000 U.S. troops in the region, and destabilize global energy markets. Source: Wall Street JournalIran Is Preparing Missiles for Possible Retaliatory Strikes on U.S. Bases, Officials SayWhat Happened: Iran has readied missiles and warned it will strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if America joins Israel\u2019s assault on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. forces are now on high alert across the region, with military leaders bracing for attacks from Iran\u2019s proxies in Iraq, Syria, and the Red Sea.Why It Matters: A wider war looms as Trump weighs joining the war against Iran. Any U.S. entry would escalate conflict, with officials warning that once America joins, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to step back.\u201dSource: New York TimesNorth Korea's Kim Met Russia's Top Security Official, State Media SaysWhat Happened: Kim Jong Un met with Russian Security Council chief Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang to cement North Korea\u2019s role in aiding Russia\u2019s war. North Korea will send 5,000 construction troops and 1,000 sappers to Russian territory\u2014violating U.N. sanctions\u2014and plans to honor North Korean fighters who aided Russia were announced.Why It Matters: This deepens the military alliance between two authoritarian regimes. North Korea\u2019s direct support for Russia\u2019s war\u2014including combat roles\u2014is illegal under international law. In return, Kim is likely gaining weapons tech, assistance with the nuclear program, and economic survival.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPowerful Trump aide who\u2019s in charge of vetting thousands of staffers still hasn\u2019t been fully vetted himself: sourcesWhat Happened: Sergio Gor, Trump\u2019s personnel director in charge of vetting over 4,000 executive branch staffers, has not submitted the mandatory SF-86 form required for permanent security clearance, sources say. Despite holding an interim clearance and immense influence over appointments, Gor has resisted the process, citing distrust of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and the FBI.Why It Matters: Gor isn\u2019t even his real name and he refused basic vetting. A Russian-born operative holds major power in Trump\u2019s government with no transparency or accountability. This is a mass national security failure.Source: New York Post    Russia Launches Deadliest Attack on Kyiv in Months, Killing 28What Happened: Russia struck Kyiv with 440 drones and 32 missiles, destroying a Kyiv apartment block and hitting 27 sites. At least 28 people, including a U.S. citizen, were killed and over 100 were injured. Odesa was also attacked, with 2 more deaths reported.Why It Matters: This was one of the most intense bombardments since Russia began its genocidal assault, with Russia launching a missile into a residential building and using cluster munitions. President Zelenskyy called it \u201cpure terrorism.\u201d The Kremlin continues targeting civilians in their sleep\u2014carrying out daily terrorist attacks across Ukraine while the U.S. provides cover for war criminal Putin.Source: BBC News Tucker Carlson clashes with Sen. Ted Cruz: 'You don't know anything about Iran'What Happened: A viral interview showed Tucker Carlson grilling Sen. Ted Cruz over his calls for regime change in Iran\u2014revealing Cruz didn\u2019t know basic facts like Iran\u2019s population or ethnic makeup. Carlson accused Cruz of warmongering.Why It Matters: The division exposes a growing civil war on the right over U.S. involvement in Israel\u2019s war with Iran. With Trump wavering, MAGA is fracturing. Carlson and others are leading an anti-war charge are disseminating Russian propaganda\u2014highlighting how Russia is now turning its influence machine on Trump to protect its close ally, Iran.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Saber-Rattling Over Iran Splits MAGA MovementWhat Happened: As Trump signals possible military action against Iran, leading MAGA figures warn it could betray his anti-war promises and fracture his base. Carlson called intervention \u201cOrwellian,\u201d while Bannon said war would derail Trump\u2019s deportation agenda. Meanwhile, hawkish Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell are pushing for full support of Israel\u2019s strikes.Why It Matters: Foreign policy divisions are tearing at the core of Trump\u2019s America First coalition. While some MAGA leaders demand restraint, others champion aggressive military support for Israel. Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsCBO: Trump\u2019s House Tax Bill Would Add $2.8 Trillion to DeficitWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump\u2019s House-passed tax and spending bill would raise the deficit by $2.8 trillion over ten years\u2014even after accounting for modest economic growth. With interest payments, the cost could hit $3.4 trillion.Why It Matters: The projection undercuts GOP lies that tax cuts will pay for themselves. As Senate Republicans revise the bill, the deficit impact could rise even higher\u2014up to $5 trillion.Source: ReutersFed Holds Rates Steady, Warns Tariffs Will Drive \u2018Meaningful\u2019 InflationWhat Happened: The Fed held rates steady but warned Trump\u2019s tariff surge will likely drive inflation back up. Slower growth and higher unemployment are now expected. Powell said rate cuts might\u2019ve started if not for Trump\u2019s trade war\u2014but Trump demanded deep cuts and hinted at taking over the Fed himself.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s economic chaos is sabotaging the economy. His threats to central bank independence echo authoritarian playbooks\u2014turning monetary policy into a political weapon and risking long-term financial instability.Source: ReutersTrump Calls Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2018a Stupid Person\u2019 Ahead of Rate DecisionWhat Happened: Ahead of a key Fed meeting, Trump lashed out at Chair Jerome Powell, calling him \u201cnot a smart person\u201d and \u201ca stupid person\u201d for resisting interest rate cuts. Trump, who appointed Powell in 2018, accused him of playing politics and joked about appointing himself to lead the Federal Reserve.Why It Matters: Theses continued attacks undermine the Fed\u2019s independence and raises ethical red flags, as Trump continues pressuring central bankers to align monetary policy with his political agenda. His remarks risk destabilizing markets and further politicizing U.S. economic institutions.Source: The IndependentIndustry Leaders Plead with White House on Relief from Raids After SetbackWhat Happened: Business and agriculture leaders are scrambling after Trump abruptly reversed a short-lived pause on workplace immigration raids, resuming sweeps at farms, hotels, and meatpacking plants. Despite Trump\u2019s earlier hints at protecting farm labor, ICE raids are accelerating, with pressure to hit 3,000 arrests daily.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation drive is colliding with the economic reality that key U.S. industries depend on undocumented workers. Even Trump-aligned businesses are alarmed. The crackdown threatens to devastate farms, food supply chains, hospitality industry, elder care, and much more.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s Tariff Clock Ticking After G-7 Yields No DealsWhat Happened: Trump left the G-7 summit without securing any new trade agreements, despite meetings with leaders from Japan, the EU, and Canada. He reaffirmed his commitment to tariffs, calling them a source of revenue, and threatened to impose sweeping new duties by July 9 if no deals are reached.Why It Matters: Trump continues using global trade as a shakedown operation. By treating tariffs as cash grabs, he\u2019s isolating allies and risking economic fallout.

Trump\u2019s energy policies are enriching his biggest donors while slashing renewable energy investments, environmental protections, and climate oversight.

From ending Biden\\u2019s LNG pause to gutting climate rules, Trump has supercharged the fossil fuel industry\\u2019s profits while dismantling environmental safeguards.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a textbook case of pay-to-play politics. Trump\\u2019s energy policies are enriching his biggest donors while slashing renewable energy investments, environmental protections, and climate oversight. Deregulation, tax loopholes, and fossil fuel-friendly appointments are transforming the federal government into a vehicle for oil and gas profiteering.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/trump-oil-gas-industry-donors\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Retired General Slams Trump\\u2019s Military Deployment in L.A. as \\u201CMadness\\u201D</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Retired Brig. Gen. Greg Smith condemned Trump\\u2019s decision to deploy Marines and federalize the California National Guard during immigration protests in Los Angeles\\u2014without Governor Gavin Newsom\\u2019s approval. Smith, a 35-year Guard veteran, called it \\u201Cmadness\\u201D and warned the military is being politicized to enforce a partisan agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Smith warns this is a dangerous abuse of executive power that bypasses state authority and risks violating the Posse Comitatus Act. He calls for urgent reform of the Insurrection Act to prevent future presidents from unilaterally using military force against civilians under vague pretexts.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/madness-a-retired-brig-general-slams-trumps-military-power-grab/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>The Trump Crackdown on Elected Officials</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s DHS and ICE are arresting Democratic lawmakers and staffers tied to immigration protests and oversight. Targets include Sen. Padilla, Rep. McIver, Brad Lander, and a Nadler aide\\u2014 on flimsy charges contradicted by video.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More political retaliation and an authoritarian crackdown on dissent and opposition. Trump is weaponizing law enforcement to silence critics as he pushes a $75 billion mass deportation plan. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-trump-crackdown-on-elected-officials\\\\\\\">The New Yorker</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>DHS Imposes New Restrictions on Lawmakers Visiting ICE Facilities</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security issued new guidelines requiring a 72-hour notice for congressional visits to ICE detention centers and barring access to ICE field offices entirely. The policy also limits lawmakers' contact with detainees and bans photography, citing \\u201Coperational concerns and privacy.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct assault on congressional oversight and transparency. Democrats say Trump is trying to hide the true impact of his immigration crackdown and silence scrutiny.

Officers are instructed to flag political activism\\u2014especially criticism of U.S. policy or support for Palestine\\u2014as grounds for denial.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The policy targets international students for surveillance and punishes political expression, raising major free speech concerns.

Padilla, NYC Comptroller Lander, Newark Mayor Baraka, and Rep. McIver\\u2014have been arrested, assaulted, or indicted for protesting Trump\\u2019s immigration crackdown. Even Judge Hannah Dugan faces charges for allegedly aiding an undocumented defendant.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is targeting elected officials who oppose him, turning dissent into a punishable offense. This is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes\\u2014used in Russia to silence opposition\\u2014and now unfolding in the U.S. as lawmakers face state retaliation.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://time.com/7295823/elected-officials-arrests-confrontations-immigration-protests/\\\\\\\">TIME</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>2,000 More National Guard Troops Deployed </h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Pentagon deployed an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Trump\\u2019s orders, bringing the total to over 4,800 personnel. The move, made under Title 10 authority typically reserved for rebellion or invasion, comes amid ongoing protests and legal battles over Trump\\u2019s ability to deploy federal troops without state consent.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The deployment is political theater and a direct attack on state sovereignty. California officials warn it guts disaster response and sets a dangerous precedent. LA is the test case\\u2014Trump is conditioning Americans to accept military in the streets as law enforcement.

He sparred with Democrats over protester arrests, military base renamings, and his defense of a press secretary who spread antisemitic conspiracy theories.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Hegseth\\u2019s comments show open defiance of judicial authority, deepening fears of a constitutional crisis as Trump\\u2019s Pentagon prioritizes loyalty over law.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/hegseth-senate-hearing-los-angeles-troop-deployment\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>VA Removes Anti-Discrimination Protections for Politics and Marital Status</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Veterans Affairs revised hospital rules to eliminate protections against discrimination based on political views, marital status, and union activity, citing compliance with Trump\\u2019s executive order on \\u201Cbiological truth.\\u201D The changes took effect without consulting VA doctors.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This paves the way for denying care to LGBTQ+ vets and politically outspoken staff.

The rule had been designed to shield patients from prosecution in states with strict abortion bans.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The ruling delivers a major blow to medical privacy protections in the post-Roe era, giving conservative states broader power to criminalize reproductive and gender-affirming care. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-judge-invalidates-biden-rule-protecting-privacy-abortions-2025-06-18/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>CAUGHT ON CAMERA: U.S. Citizen Detained During ICE Traffic Stop</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Jose Castro, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was forcibly removed from his truck by ICE and CBP agents in Rochester, NY, during a raid caught on video. Castro repeatedly asserted his citizenship and asked to see a warrant, which agents failed to present before smashing his window. He was later released without explanation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is yet another disturbing example of American citizens being swept up in Trump\\u2019s aggressive deportation dragnet.

Legal experts say the incident likely violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars military involvement in civilian law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s first known Marine detention on U.S. soil was an Army veteran trying to get to a VA appointment.

The drop is tied to expanded benefits and declining birth and wage trends.
