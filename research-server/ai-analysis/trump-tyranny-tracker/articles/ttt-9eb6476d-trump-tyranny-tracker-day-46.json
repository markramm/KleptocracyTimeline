Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesSubscribe\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 6Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsPrivate Prison Companies Set to Make Billions Reopening Jails for ICEWhat Happened: Trump has revived private immigration detention, awarding contracts to CoreCivic and GEO Group to reopen shuttered ICE facilities. This includes the South Texas Family Residential Center, which will detain 2,400 migrants, including children. More than 16 vacant facilities are slated for reopening nationwide, expanding mass detention and deportation operations.Why It Matters: Private prison corporations are cashing in on Trump\u2019s mass deportation plans, profiting from inhumane detention policies. These centers\u2014many previously closed due to abuse and neglect scandals\u2014are now being reactivated, highlighting a return to for-profit incarceration of migrants at an unprecedented scale.Source: Mother JonesTrump\u2019s first White House Crypto Summit has VIPs pushing for favorable lawsWhat Happened: Trump created a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using seized assets, with no audit or oversight. A new Treasury-run Digital Asset Stockpile will hold other confiscated crypto.Why It Matters: With no audit of federal crypto holdings, the move raises concerns about potential corruption, hidden asset transfers, foreign influence, and Trump and his family\u2019s financial interests in digital currencies. Source: CNBCCBO: House GOP Budget Requires Medicaid Cuts to Fund Tax BreaksWhat Happened: A Congressional Budget Office analysis found that House Republicans\u2019 budget goals\u2014cutting $1.5 trillion in spending\u2014would require slashing Medicaid by at least $880 billion over a decade. The cuts would help fund Trump-backed tax breaks for the rich.Why It Matters: The plan prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy over healthcare for low-income Americans, exposing the corruption behind claims of fiscal responsibility.Source: CBS NewsSecretive D.C. Influence Project Appears to Be Running a Group House for Right-Wing LawmakersWhat Happened: Evangelical pastor Steve Berger is running a Capitol Hill townhouse where House Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Andy Ogles, and other Trump cronies reside. The home, owned by GOP megadonor Lee Beaman, serves as a hub for shaping far-right policy without transparency or lobbying disclosures.Why It Matters: This secretive operation blurs the line between religious influence and policymaking, highlighting ethical and legal concerns about undisclosed lobbying and corruption in Trump\u2019s inner circle.Source: ProPublicaRipple CEO\u2019s Cozy Ties to Trump Raise Corruption ConcernsWhat Happened: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, once fighting an SEC lawsuit, has maneuvered into Trump\u2019s inner circle, benefiting from the regime\u2019s plan to stockpile digital assets\u2014including XRP, the cryptocurrency Ripple holds in massive quantities.Why It Matters: Garlinghouse\u2019s influence over Trump\u2019s crypto policy reeks of corruption. It raises questions about favoritism and backroom deals and reiterates that public policy is being shaped to enrich politically connected executives.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsGSA to reduce tech services arm by 50%, eliminate non-statutory workWhat Happened: The GSA is cutting its Technology Transformation Services by half, eliminating non-statutory work. Director Thomas Shedd says only Trump-approved \u201ccritical\u201d projects like Login.gov and FedRAMP will continue while layoffs and contract terminations are underway. The 18F tech team has been shut down.Why It Matters: This move aligns with Trump\u2019s push to gut government operations to only \u201ccore services.\u201d The cuts raise concerns about the future of government tech modernization efforts, reducing federal capacity for digital transformation and innovation.

Bar AssociationWhat Happened: Trump cronies Bradley Bondi (AG Pam Bondi\u2019s brother) and Alicia Long (a top deputy to Trump\u2019s interim U.S. attorney for D.C.) are running for leadership positions in the influential D.C. Bar Association. The group oversees legal ethics and licensing for federal attorneys.Why It Matters: Trump is politicizing legal oversight, shielding Trump-aligned lawyers from misconduct scrutiny while targeting those who oppose his agenda.Source: NBC NewsTrump Suspends Security Clearances for Perkins Coie LawyersWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order suspending security clearances for employees of Perkins Coie, a law firm known for its Democratic ties and legal challenges to his policies. He cited the firm\u2019s \u201cDEI practices\u201d as justification while restricting its lawyers' access to federal buildings.Why It Matters: This is a blatant abuse of power to target political opponents and cripple legal challenges against his regime. It further erodes legal norms and weaponizes national security against dissent.Source: CNN\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsMusk Operatives Demand Access to Sensitive Child Support DatabaseWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s operatives sought access to a highly sensitive database containing income data on nearly all U.S. workers, sparking another clash with career civil servants.

The Trump regime is trying to dismantle the aid agency, remove its president, and install a political loyalist, Pete Marocco, as acting leader.Why It Matters: Using marshals to seize control of a legally independent agency is an authoritarian power grab, undermining the rule of law while consolidating Trump\u2019s control over government institutions.Source: The New York TimesPentagon's DEI Purge Targets War Heroes, Military FirstsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DEI purge has flagged 26,000+ images for removal across all military branches, targeting diversity initiatives. This includes photos of Medal of Honor recipients, pioneering female Marines, and historic military milestones. Officials say up to 100,000 images and posts could be erased from Pentagon websites and social media.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is not just eliminating DEI programs\u2014it\u2019s erasing history. The purge disproportionately targets women, minorities, and commemorative events, effectively rewriting military history to align with his regime\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: Military TimesGeorgetown Law Blasts Trump Prosecutor\u2019s \u2018Attack\u2019 on First AmendmentWhat Happened: Georgetown Law Dean William Treanor condemned Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Ed Martin for threatening to blacklist graduates over the school\u2019s DEI policies. Treanor called it a violation of the First Amendment and an attack on the university\u2019s Jesuit mission.Why It Matters: Martin, a Stop the Steal activist with no prosecutorial experience, is using federal power to enforce Trump\u2019s extreme ideological agenda, undermining academic freedom and constitutional protections.Source: NBC NewsTrump-Backed Bill Would Gut Environmental ProtectionsWhat Happened: Congress is considering industry-backed legislation to ban the EPA from using IRIS chemical assessments, which form the scientific basis for environmental protections. \u201cIts scientists assess the toxicity of chemicals, estimating the amount of each that triggers cancer and other health effects.\u201dWhy It Matters: If passed, the bill would cripple pollution limits, endanger public health, and allow corporations to challenge longstanding environmental rules. This is an attack on science and public safety in favor of industry profits.Source: ProPublicaTrump DOJ Investigates University of California Over Pro-Palestinian ProtestsWhat Happened: The Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, launched a civil rights investigation into the University of California system for alleged antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian campus protests. The probe will assess whether UC allowed a \"hostile work environment\" for Jewish employees.Why It Matters: The move reflects Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on campus activism and could set a precedent for suppressing protests, further politicizing federal civil rights enforcement.Source: The GuardianTrump Moves to Roll Back Chemical Plant Safety RulesWhat Happened: Trump is seeking to pause legal challenges to 2024 Biden-era chemical plant safety regulations while it considers rolling them back. The rules, enacted after deadly industrial accidents, protect workers at 12,000 facilities nationwide.Why It Matters: Weakening these safeguards risks worker safety and public health, echoing Trump\u2019s first-term rollbacks that prioritized industry profits over lives.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Moves to Block Lawsuits With Costly Legal HurdlesWhat Happened: A White House memo encourages agencies to invoke a rarely used rule requiring plaintiffs suing the government to post upfront payments, potentially deterring lawsuits. The move targets legal challenges to Trump\u2019s policies, including immigration and spending cuts.Why It Matters: This is a blatant attempt to limit judicial oversight and silence opposition by making it financially impossible for advocacy groups and individuals to challenge Trump\u2019s agenda.Source: CNNInside the White House\u2019s new media strategy to promote Trump as \u2018KING\u2019What Happened: The White House has transformed its press operation into a rapid-response influencer machine, using social media, memes, and viral content to promote Trump\u2019s authoritarian branding. The strategy aims to silence critics while pushing pro-Trump propaganda directly to millions.Why It Matters: This aggressive, state-sponsored disinformation campaign is designed to sideline traditional media, manipulate public perception, and normalize Trump\u2019s power grab. This is a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: The Washington Post\u2018People Are Going Silent\u2019: Fearing Retribution, Trump Critics Muzzle ThemselvesWhat Happened: Six weeks into his second term, Trump\u2019s threats and retribution have silenced critics across government, business, and academia. Fired federal workers, CEOs, and even Republican lawmakers fear backlash, online attacks, or financial ruin for speaking out.Why It Matters: This chilling effect on public debate reiterates a dangerous slide toward authoritarianism, where fear of Trump and his cronies, including Elon Musk, stifles dissent.Source: The New York TimesTrump Orders Staffers to Stop Reading the News at WorkWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration has banned employees from accessing \u201cgeneral news\u201d websites on government computers, alongside restrictions on sports and online shopping. Why It Matters: This move is an authoritarian attempt to isolate federal employees from independent information sources, controlling the narrative as Trump and Musk look to dismantle Social Security. The move highlights the lack of government transparency and prevents employees from accessing critical information.Source: Rolling StoneMAGA Turns on Justice Amy Coney Barrett for Defying TrumpWhat Happened: Trump-appointed Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing backlash from MAGA activists for voting against Trump\u2019s priorities in key 5-4 rulings. Right-wing figures accuse her of being \u201cweak\u201d and not loyal enough to Trump.Why It Matters: The attacks highlight the authoritarian nature of Trump\u2019s movement, demanding total loyalty over judicial independence and further eroding democratic norms.Source: NBC News'We're in a dark space,' US judge says on rising threatsWhat Happened: Federal judges warn that threats against the judiciary have surged \u201cexponentially,\u201d fueled by Trump cronies and Elon Musk\u2019s attacks to discredit judges who block White House policies. Republican lawmakers are even pushing to impeach judges who rule against Trump.Why It Matters: The judiciary is under siege as Trump and his allies escalate their authoritarian tactics, intimidating judges and eroding the rule of law to eliminate checks on executive power.Source: Reuters\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Weighs Revoking Legal Status for 240,000 Ukrainians, Fast-Tracking DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump is considering stripping legal protections from 240,000 Ukrainians who fled Russia\u2019s invasion, potentially forcing them into deportation. The move is part of a broader crackdown targeting over 1.8 million migrants granted humanitarian parole under Biden.Why It Matters: Deporting war refugees\u2014especially Ukrainians amid an ongoing Russian invasion\u2014would be a devastating betrayal of U.S. allies and a gift to Putin, further aligning Trump\u2019s policies with Kremlin interests.Source: ReutersTrump Mulls Major Changes to Federal Student Loan OfficeWhat Happened: Trump proposed moving the Federal Student Aid office out of the Education Department, arguing that managing student loans is \u201cnot their business.\u201d He suggested shifting oversight to the Small Business Administration, led by former GOP Senator Kelly Loeffler.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump's broader effort to dismantle the Education Department, jeopardizing federal student loan management and borrower protections. With staffing cuts already underway, the future of student aid is increasingly uncertain.Source: USA Today\u201cThe Entire System Will Collapse\u201d: Inside the Purge of U.S. Immigration CourtsWhat Happened: Trump has fired 28 immigration court officials, including 15 immigration judges, 8 assistant chief judges, and 5 senior managers, as part of a sweeping purge. These dismissals, along with resignations and retirements, will eliminate over 10,000 hearings this year, worsening the already staggering 3.6 million-case backlog.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass firings cripple the immigration courts, sabotaging their ability to process cases while advancing his extreme deportation agenda. The chaos will force asylum seekers and immigrants into legal limbo for years while sending a chilling message to remaining judges: rule in favor of mass deportations or risk being next.Source: Mother JonesTrump Revives Family Detention for MigrantsWhat Happened: Trump has reinstated the detention of migrant families with children, reversing Biden-era policies. ICE has begun holding families in Texas facilities as part of Trump\u2019s planned mass deportations.Why It Matters: The practice, condemned by advocates as harmful to children, was previously phased out due to legal and humanitarian concerns. Critics warn of severe psychological and human rights impacts.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s FDA Pick Signals Possible Abortion Pill CrackdownWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s FDA nominee, Dr. Marty Makary, said he would review the Biden-era rule allowing mifepristone to be dispensed without in-person visits, raising concerns about restricting access to the abortion pill.Why It Matters: Conservatives have targeted mifepristone since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Reinstating in-person requirements would make it harder for patients to access abortion medication, furthering Trump\u2019s anti-choice agenda.Source: NBC NewsICE Raid Fears Keep Students Out of SchoolWhat Happened: School attendance has dropped as fear spreads over Trump\u2019s policy allowing ICE arrests in schools. Educators report increased absenteeism, anxiety, and reduced parental involvement. Denver Public Schools is suing, arguing the policy harms students even without direct arrests.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown is terrorizing immigrant communities, disrupting education, and punishing children for their families\u2019 legal status.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Cuts to Bureau of Indian Affairs Threaten Tribal RightsWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are directing the closure of 25 regional Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. These offices provide essential services, including infrastructure approvals and law enforcement funding.Why It Matters: Tribal leaders warn that the closures could violate the U.S. government\u2019s legal trust responsibilities to Indigenous nations, destabilizing communities and cutting off vital services. The move raises concerns over treaty obligations and the erosion of tribal sovereignty.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchCIA Fires Probationary Employees Amid Rising Foreign Recruitment ThreatsWhat Happened: The CIA has begun terminating some probationary employees, typically those with fewer than two years on the job, citing a review of personnel suitability. The move follows a federal judge\u2019s ruling allowing CIA Director John Ratcliffe to dismiss employees at his discretion.Why It Matters: Intelligence agencies warn that foreign adversaries, including Russia and China, are actively recruiting disgruntled federal employees with security clearances. By slashing intelligence personnel without safeguards, Trump\u2019s regime is creating serious national security risks\u2014handing adversaries an opportunity to exploit newly jobless officers.Source: Defense OneTrump\u2019s Purge of U.S. Spy Agencies Sparks Fear, Weakens IntelligenceWhat Happened: Trump is firing thousands of intelligence personnel, including those at the CIA and Pentagon, targeting probationary employees and those involved in diversity programs.

Why It Matters: Cutting these programs weakens global security, increases the risk of rogue states developing WMDs, and dismantles pandemic surveillance efforts. These reckless cuts directly threaten U.S. national security and global stability.Source: WIREDA Sensitive Complex Housing a CIA Facility Was on GSA's List of US Properties for SaleWhat Happened: The General Services Administration briefly published a list of 443 federal properties up for sale, including a sensitive CIA facility in Springfield, Virginia. The list was swiftly removed after concerns arose over the security implications of listing a site reportedly used for covert training in surveillance, hacking, and break-ins.Why It Matters: The sale of sensitive government facilities raises serious national security risks and highlights the incompetence of Musk behind the rushed federal downsizing. The CIA facility\u2019s inclusion underscores the insanity and danger to national security amid reckless mismanagement in Trump\u2019s chaotic government purge, with critical intelligence assets now at risk of exposure or compromise.Source: WIREDPentagon Freezes Government Credit Cards in DOGE Cost-Cutting DriveWhat Happened: The Pentagon has suspended civilian government credit card use, ordering non-essential travel cancellations and reducing purchase card spending limits to just $1. Why It Matters: This reckless freeze paralyzes daily Pentagon operations, disrupting procurement for essential supplies and grounding civilian personnel. Unauthorized, FAKE DOGE\u2019s extreme austerity measures will cripple military readiness, forcing agencies to halt critical spending and contract obligations.Source: Defense OneDOGE Cuts to VA Contracts Threaten Veterans\u2019 CareWhat Happened: Elon Musk is canceling 585 VA contracts, down from an initial 875, after backlash from VA employees. Many cuts target essential services like sterility certification, air quality testing, and PTSD research. The VA refuses to disclose the full list.Why It Matters: Slashing these contracts endangers patient safety and veterans\u2019 healthcare, exposing Trump\u2019s agenda as reckless and harmful to those who served.Source: NBC NewsTrump to Close European Consulates, Cut State Department StaffWhat Happened: Trump plans to shut down multiple U.S. consulates in Western Europe and cut State Department staff by at least 10%. Bureaus focused on human rights, refugees, and global criminal justice may also be merged or eliminated.Why It Matters: Slashing America\u2019s diplomatic footprint weakens U.S. global influence while empowering adversaries like Russia and China. Closing the Gaziantep office further undermines U.S. support for humanitarian efforts in Syria.Source: The GuardianTrump Moves to Shut Down Critical Volcano Monitoring FacilitiesWhat Happened: Trump plans to terminate leases for key volcano observatories in Alaska and Hawaii, which provide early eruption warnings. Job cuts at the General Services Administration will further complicate efforts to relocate staff and equipment.Why It Matters: Shutting down these observatories threatens public safety, leaving hundreds of thousands at risk near active volcanoes. This reckless move endangers lives and air travel.Source: NOTUSTrump to Close National Park Visitor Centers, MuseumsWhat Happened: Trump plans to terminate leases for 34 National Park Service buildings, including visitor centers, museums, and law enforcement offices, as part of his purge. The closures will leave millions of artifacts vulnerable and disrupt park operations.Why It Matters: Gutting the National Park Service will degrade visitor experiences, threaten cultural preservation, and weaken public access to protected lands\u2014all under the guise of \u201ccost-cutting.\u201dSource: The Washington Post\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGreenland PM Rejects Trump\u2019s Push to \u2018Get\u2019 IslandWhat Happened: Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede rebuked Trump\u2019s renewed call to acquire the island, declaring, \u201cGreenland is ours\u201d and \u201cnot for sale.\u201d Trump told Congress the U.S. would take the Arctic territory \u201cone way or the other.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s insistence on acquiring the island echoes Putin\u2019s tactics, raising alarms about U.S. disregard for sovereignty while threatening a NATO member.Source: ABC NewsPoland, Baltics Back Macron\u2019s Nuclear Deterrent Plan What Happened: Poland and the Baltic states welcomed French President Macron\u2019s proposal to extend France\u2019s nuclear deterrent to Europe amid Russian threats. The Kremlin condemned the move as \u201cextremely confrontational.\u201dWhy It Matters: With the U.S. commitment uncertain under Trump, European nations are exploring independent security options to counter Russia\u2019s aggression, signaling a shift in NATO dynamics.Source: The HillNuclear Watchdog Warns Trump May Trigger New Arms RaceWhat Happened: IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi warns that Trump\u2019s policies, including withdrawing from arms control agreements, have pushed more countries\u2014like Iran\u2014to consider developing nuclear weapons.

Discussions are already underway as trust in U.S. security commitments erodes.Why It Matters: A pullback in intelligence sharing would weaken U.S. security and signal a historic shift in alliances, highlighting that Trump\u2019s policies benefit Moscow at the expense of Western stability.Source: NBC NewsTrump Questions NATO Defense of U.S., Ignoring Allies\u2019 9/11 SupportWhat Happened: Trump suggested NATO allies might not defend the U.S. in an attack, despite Article 5 being invoked after 9/11\u2014 the only time it was invoked. Over 1,000 allied troops died fighting alongside Americans in the War on Terror. He also reiterated threats to abandon allies who don\u2019t meet defense spending targets.Why It Matters: Trump's comments undermine NATO unity and echo his past remarks encouraging Russian aggression and withdrawing the U.S. from NATO. The rhetoric weakens U.S. alliances and signals instability to adversaries. America First will be America Alone.Source: ABC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsStock Market Drops as Economic Fears MountWhat Happened: U.S. markets tumbled on Thursday amid fears of slowing economic growth and Trump\u2019s tariffs see-saw.
