(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 14Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and XWhat Happened: Chris Young, a Musk adviser, is being paid up to $1 million a year by a Musk-linked firm while working inside unauthorized DOGE. He\u2019s led the charge to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014an agency that regulates Musk\u2019s companies like Tesla and X. Records show he purged staff, canceled contracts, and diverted enforcement funds.Why It Matters: This is a textbook case of corrupt self-dealing. A Musk-paid adviser is embedded in the government to destroy a watchdog agency overseeing Musk\u2019s businesses. Source: ProPublicaTrump\u2019s Middle East Visit Overlaps with Family\u2019s Expanding Business and Crypto DealsWhat Happened: While Trump tours Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, his sons are locking in major real estate, crypto, and luxury deals with Gulf state-backed firms. The Trump Organization is securing new resorts, towers, and a $2 billion crypto investment tied to Trump\u2019s coin.Why It Matters: Trump is using the presidency to expand his family\u2019s business empire. Gulf dictators are bankrolling Trump-branded deals while influencing U.S. policy, and foreign policy is being twisted for Trump\u2019s profit, not America\u2019s interests. This is global-scale corruption.Source: Associated PressWith Trump Visit, Qatar\u2019s Image Makeover Scores Another SuccessWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s red-carpet visit to Qatar \u2014 including praise for its emir and a possible $400 million luxury jet bribe \u2014 marks a flip from his 2017 claim that Qatar funds terrorism. The Gulf state spent millions on image rehab, hiring lobbyists like Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, and is now positioned as a key U.S. partner.Why It Matters: For personal profit, Trump is helping Qatar whitewash its image. He once called it a terror funder, but now he\u2019s accepting bribes while showering them with praise. Even some MAGA allies say he\u2019s selling out. Source: New York TimesTrump Kills Biden-Era Plan to Limit Sale of Americans' Personal DataWhat Happened: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Russell Vought, has scrapped a Biden-era rule that would have regulated data brokers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule aimed to stop the unchecked sale of Americans\u2019 personal data.Why It Matters: This rollback leaves Americans exposed to scams, surveillance, and identity theft. It\u2019s part of a wider Trump effort to gut the CFPB, kill enforcement, and let corporations profit off your private data without accountability.Source: ReutersTrump-Kushner Serbia Hotel Project Stalls After Forgery ScandalWhat Happened: A top Serbian official admitted to forging a government document that allowed a bombed-out defense complex in Belgrade to be demolished for a $500 million Trump-Kushner luxury hotel project. The fake document stripped the site of protected status, clearing the way for the controversial real estate deal backed by Trump\u2019s family.Why It Matters: Foreign governments are rewriting laws and faking records to funnel cash and assets to the Trump family in exchange for influence. This isn\u2019t just corruption\u2014it\u2019s international bribery in plain sight.Source: New York TimesTrump Commerce Chief Tied to Controversial Crypto Firm in El SalvadorWhat Happened: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, holds a 5% stake in crypto giant Tether, manages its U.S. assets, and helped broker a $775M investment in MAGA-aligned video platform Rumble. Both Tether and Rumble are now deeply tied to El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian government.Why It Matters: Tether has a history of fraud and money laundering probes. Now it\u2019s hiding out in El Salvador, enjoying tax breaks and zero oversight. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s commerce chief Howard Lutnick is profiting from it while helping write U.S. crypto policy\u2014an ethical and national security nightmare.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsThe End of Rule of Law in AmericaWhat Happened: Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig warns that Trump\u2019s second term has marked the collapse of the rule of law. Trump has pardoned insurrectionists, arrested judges, ignored court orders, and weaponized the DOJ to target enemies\u2014all while defying the Constitution.Why It Matters: Luttig argues the U.S. is no longer a government of laws. With Trump dismantling judicial independence and centralizing power, American democracy is in existential danger.Source: The AtlanticRepublicans Slide \u201cNonprofit Killer\u201d Law Into Tax BillWhat Happened: Republicans have revived the \u201cStop Terror Financing\u201d bill by quietly inserting it into their new tax package. The bill lets the Treasury Department revoke tax-exempt status from any nonprofit it suspects of \u201cterrorism\u201d ties\u2014without due process. Trump\u2019s White House defines what counts as terrorism.Why It Matters: This would give Trump unchecked power to silence opposition groups, from disability advocates to universities, by branding them terrorist-adjacent, and will be used to intimidate nonprofits and chill protest nationwide.Source: Mother JonesRubio to Restructure National Security Council What Happened: Marco Rubio is spearheading a drastic overhaul of the National Security Council, planning to slash staff from over 150 to as few as 50 and refocus the NSC from a policy advisory body into one that executes Trump\u2019s orders.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s overhaul of the National Security Council guts its traditional role of expert coordination. Instead of informing decisions, the NSC will simply carry out Trump\u2019s orders\u2014no dissent, no debate. It\u2019s a move straight from an authoritarian playbook: purge the professionals, concentrate power, and rule through loyalists.Source: NBC NewsHomeland Chief Suggests Suspending Habeas Corpus Over ImmigrationWhat Happened: Kristi Noem told Congress that current levels of illegal immigration could justify suspending habeas corpus\u2014the constitutional right to challenge detention. Top Trump advisor Stephen Miller confirmed that Trump is actively considering the move to expedite mass deportations.Why It Matters: This would pave the way for mass civil liberties violations, indefinite detention, and the erasure of due process. This is authoritarian power disguised as national security.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsGabbard Moves to Control President\u2019s Daily Brief as Trump Questions Intel Office\u2019s RoleWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard is taking control of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, moving its assembly from CIA headquarters to her own office. She\u2019s also seized authority over the National Intelligence Council, removing its acting leadership and placing it under her direct oversight.Why It Matters: Gabbard is centralizing power over U.S. intelligence, sidelining career experts, and cutting the CIA out of its traditional role. This marks a dangerous shift\u2014turning a nonpartisan security process into a tool controlled by a Trump loyalist.Source: New York TimesGabbard Fires Intelligence Leaders After Report Contradicts Trump Deportation ClaimsWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard fired the top 2 leaders of the National Intelligence Council\u2014Mike Collins and Maria Langan-Riekhof\u2014who oversaw key threat assessments. Their removal follows the NIC\u2019s release of a report on Venezuelan gang activity that contradicted Trump\u2019s justification for mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.Why It Matters: Gabbard\u2019s purge targets career professionals seen as obstacles to Trump\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s part of a broader campaign to politicize intelligence, silence dissent, and suppress facts that conflict with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda.Source: The Washington PostEd Martin, Ousted D.C. Prosecutor, to Review Biden Pardons in New DOJ RoleWhat Happened: Ed Martin, a far-right Trump loyalist whose Senate confirmation failed, announced that he will review President Biden\u2019s pardons and Jan. 6 prosecutions from a new post inside the Justice Department.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader weaponization of the DOJ. Ed Martin\u2019s new role will be used to harass political opponents, carry out Trump\u2019s retribution, and intensify crackdowns on D.C. and immigration\u2014all under the false banner of \u201claw and order.\u201dSource: The Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Plans D.C. Tank Parade for His Birthday and Army AnniversaryWhat Happened: Trump will mark his 79th birthday and the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary with a massive military parade in Washington, D.C., featuring 25 Abrams tanks, 6,500 troops, and 50 aircraft. The event could cost up to $45 million, excluding city cleanup and road repair expenses.Why It Matters: This is a wasteful authoritarian spectacle\u2014using the U.S. military for a political parade mirrors regimes like Russia and North Korea. It\u2019s about glorifying power and propping up Trump\u2019s image.Source: ReutersWhite House Correspondents Protest Wire Reporters Barred from Air Force OneWhat Happened: Trump barred AP, Bloomberg, and Reuters from traveling on Air Force One during his Middle East trip, violating long-standing press norms. The move follows AP\u2019s refusal to adopt Trump\u2019s preferred term \u201cGulf of America\u201d in coverage.Why It Matters: The exclusion curtails rapid, broad public access to presidential coverage and further escalates Trump\u2019s war on the independent press. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s effort to control information and punish outlets that defy propaganda demands.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Turns Child Welfare Agency Into Deportation ToolWhat Happened: The Office of Refugee Resettlement, meant to protect immigrant children, is now aiding ICE by sharing sponsor data under Trump\u2019s orders. This shift has led to raids, detentions, and fear among families, with staff warning the agency is being turned into an enforcement arm.Why It Matters: A safety agency is now a surveillance tool. Vulnerable children are being left in limbo as sponsors fear deportation, endangering lives and breaking a system built to protect them.Source: ProPublicaFederal appeals court deals major blow to Voting Rights ActWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled that private individuals can no longer sue under the Voting Rights Act in 7 states, limiting enforcement to the Department of Justice. The Trump DOJ has already dropped major VRA cases and gutted its civil rights division.Why It Matters: This decision overturns decades of precedent and effectively blocks voters from challenging racially discriminatory election laws in court. With Trump\u2019s DOJ abandoning voting rights enforcement, civil rights groups warn that the VRA\u2019s power to protect voters of color is being dismantled.Source: CNNICE detains dad, teen daughter in same detention center following Georgia traffic stopsWhat Happened: Ximena Arias-Cristobal, a 19-year-old undocumented college student, was wrongly pulled over in Dalton, Georgia. Charges were dropped after dash cam footage cleared her\u2014but she remains in ICE custody and faces deportation.Why It Matters: Despite being cleared, Arias-Cristobal is now caught in Trump\u2019s deportation dragnet. She\u2019s lived in the U.S. since age 4. Her father was also detained after a separate minor traffic stop.Source: USA TodayTrump Expands Deportations to Third Countries With Grim Human Rights RecordsWhat Happened: Trump is cutting deals with authoritarian regimes like Rwanda and Libya to take in U.S. deportees. Some have already been sent to El Salvador\u2019s CECOT gulag, and others narrowly avoided transfer to Libya before a court stepped in.Why It Matters: Trump is attempting to create a global deportation system outside the reach of U.S. courts\u2014outsourcing detention to brutal regimes known for human rights abuses. This guts due process, violates international law, and endangers lives.Source: New York TimesTrump ICE Chief Confirms 9 Detainee DeathsWhat Happened: Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed 9 detainee deaths in custody since Trump\u2019s second term began. Why It Matters: People are dying in ICE custody\u2014and the public isn\u2019t being told. Delayed death reports, inhumane overcrowding, and blocked oversight reveal a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the shadows. Trump\u2019s deportation regime is shredding legal safeguards and basic human rights.Source: USA Today\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHouse GOP Advances Medicaid Cuts What Happened: The House Energy & Commerce Committee approved sweeping Medicaid cuts in a 30\u201324 party-line vote. The measure now moves to the Budget Committee as part of a broader GOP reconciliation package enacting Trump\u2019s economic agenda.Why It Matters: The plan could gut Medicaid\u2014kicking millions off coverage, punishing states that support undocumented immigrants, and rewarding the rich with tax breaks. Vulnerable Americans will pay the price.Source: The HillAmerica, Say Goodbye to a Generation of Scientists, Researchers, and Policy ExpertsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s gutting of science funding, government research, and federal agencies is driving out young scientists, public servants, and policy experts. Programs like NIH, NSF, and USAID are being gutted, and job offers are vanishing across universities and federal institutions.Why It Matters: A generational brain drain is underway. Talented Americans trained in science, foreign policy, and public health are moving to other countries. Trump\u2019s assault will cripple U.S. leadership in science and global affairs.Source: Mother JonesUSDA Cancels Global Food Aid Grants Under Trump Spending CutsWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has canceled all existing grants under the Food for Progress program, which sends American farm goods abroad to support agricultural development and food security. Why It Matters: Slashing food aid hurts hungry nations and American farmers. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s isolationist agenda\u2014ceding global influence to Russia and China while cutting off a vital lifeline millions depend on.Source: ReutersTrump Surgeon General Pick Praised Psychedelics, Said Mushrooms Helped Her Find LoveWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, has promoted unproven psychedelic therapies\u2014including psilocybin mushrooms, which she credits with helping her find love. Why It Matters: The surgeon general\u2019s role is to offer credible, science-based guidance. Means\u2019 promotion of banned drugs and lack of medical credentials highlight how Trump and RFK Jr. are destroying public health leadership and undermining trust when it\u2019s needed most.Source: Associated PressEPA to Roll Back 'Forever Chemical' Rule, Delay ProtectionsWhat Happened: The EPA, led by Lee Zeldin, announced it will roll back most of the Biden-era drinking water standards for toxic PFAS chemicals. While limits on PFOA and PFOS will remain, compliance deadlines are pushed to 2031, and regulations on three other PFAS chemicals will be rescinded.Why It Matters: Known as \"forever chemicals\" for their persistence in the environment and human body, PFAS are linked to serious health risks. Public health experts warn this rollback endangers vulnerable communities and delays urgently needed protections.Source: ReutersThe World Is Wooing U.S. Researchers Shunned by TrumpWhat Happened: As Trump slashes funding, restricts academic freedom, and drives out immigrants, countries like France, Spain, Canada, and Australia are seizing the opportunity to lure American scientists. Many are offering grants, jobs, and social benefits to researchers.Why It Matters: As Trump wages war on science\u2014slashing funding, gutting institutions, and purging experts\u2014top researchers are leaving. Foreign governments call it a \u201conce-in-a-century opportunity.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t just undermining science but destroying America\u2019s future.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udd0e Disinformation WatchMusk\u2019s AI Grok Pushes \u201cWhite Genocide\u201d Claims UnpromptedWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s AI chatbot Grok has been inserting claims about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa into unrelated user posts on X. The bot referenced Musk\u2019s views and echoed far-right rhetoric, even when no prompts mentioned South Africa.Why It Matters: Musk is now using AI to spread disinformation and far-right propaganda on X. It\u2019s a dangerous abuse of technology\u2014and a warning sign of how bad it will get.Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGermany Foils Alleged Russian Plot to Mail ExplosivesWhat Happened: German authorities arrested 3 men\u2014two in Germany, one in Switzerland\u2014accused of plotting to send explosive-laden packages in a Russian-backed sabotage campaign targeting logistics operators. The suspects reportedly tested the scheme with GPS-tracked dummy packages.Why It Matters: The plot highlights Russia\u2019s continued war against the West. It follows a pattern of arson, sabotage, and attempted assassinations tied to Kremlin operatives across Europe.Source: Wall Street JournalPoland Detects Foreign-Funded Election Ads Amid Russian Interference FearsWhat Happened: Poland\u2019s National Research Institute uncovered foreign-funded Facebook ads ahead of the May 18 election. The ads weren\u2019t linked to any official campaign and outspent all registered candidates while targeting multiple contenders.Why It Matters: The tactic mirrors Russia\u2019s 2024 interference in Romania and raises alarms about a wider Kremlin operation. With Poland central to NATO\u2019s Ukraine support, Moscow is again escalating disinformation to destabilize one of its strongest regional opponents.Source: The Kyiv IndependentPoland Prepares for WarWhat Happened: Poland is rapidly militarizing, spending nearly 5% of its GDP on defense\u2014more than any other NATO country. It\u2019s deploying Abrams tanks, laying mines and anti-tank barriers along its border, and training civilians for war.Why It Matters: As Trump weakens NATO and courts Putin, Poland is preparing to defend itself. With Russia rebuilding and eyeing the Baltics, Warsaw sees war as a real possibility.Source: NPRTrump Bans U.S. Agencies From Participating in G-20 Summit in South AfricaWhat Happened: Trump has ordered all U.S. agencies to boycott the G-20 summit in South Africa, citing lies that the country\u2019s land reform law is fueling a \u201cgenocide\u201d against White farmers.Why It Matters: This unprecedented U.S. withdrawal disrupts G-20 diplomacy and cedes global influence to Russia and China. Trump is fueling far-right conspiracy theories while escalating tensions with South Africa.Source: The Washington PostWill Russia Attack NATO? Experts Warn of Possible Invasion by 2027What Happened: A new report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) warns that Russia could rebuild its military and threaten NATO as early as 2027 if a ceasefire is reached in Ukraine. The report suggests Putin could test NATO\u2019s Article 5 by targeting a Baltic state within two years.Why It Matters: The warning comes as Trump threatens to withdraw U.S. support for NATO unless European allies vastly increase defense spending. If the U.S. exits the alliance, Europe would need to purchase hundreds of fighter jets and destroyers, and recruit over 100,000 troops to deter Russia alone.Source: The TimesKim Jong-un Tells North Korean Army to Prepare for WarWhat Happened: Kim Jong-un has ordered North Korea\u2019s military to make \u201cfull preparations for war,\u201d emphasizing readiness for \u201call levels of modern warfare,\u201d including advanced IT and scientific systems. Why It Matters: North Korea\u2019s war posture reflects its deepening military alliance with Russia. Kim praised North Korean troops who reportedly fought in Ukraine and called ties with Moscow a \u201csacred mission.\u201d It\u2019s a dangerous alignment of authoritarian regimes and a growing threat to global security.Source: The Telegraph\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchU.S. Reportedly Opposes Zelenskyy\u2019s Invitation to NATO SummitWhat Happened: The U.S. is reportedly blocking President Zelenskyy from attending the June NATO summit in The Hague. If true, it would be the first time Zelenskyy has been excluded from a NATO summit since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Why It Matters: The decision shocked NATO allies. Trump is deliberately undermining alliance unity and handing Putin another win by sidelining Ukraine when support is most critical.Source: The Kyiv IndependentTrump \u2018Weakened\u2019 the West as Russian Threat Rises, Warns Former NATO ChiefWhat Happened: Former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that Trump has significantly undermined Western unity and Ukraine\u2019s defense by offering concessions to Russia and questioning U.S. NATO commitments. Rasmussen criticized Trump for weakening deterrence while Putin refuses to make meaningful compromises.Why It Matters: Rasmussen backed assessments that Russia could attack the EU within years and called for NATO to double its defense spending goal. He suggested a new alliance of democracies\u2014the \u201cD7\u201d\u2014may be needed as the U.S. retreats from global leadership.Source: PoliticoPutin Refuses to Meet Zelenskyy, Sends Junior Team to Peace TalksWhat Happened: Putin declined to attend Ukraine peace talks in Turkey, sending low-level officials instead. Zelenskyy, who had pushed for a direct meeting, arrived in Ankara as Trump also backed out. Why It Matters: The Istanbul talks are a sham. Russia continues its genocidal war on Ukraine, and Trump is enabling it. He was eager to attend\u2014until he found out Putin wouldn\u2019t be there. Meanwhile, Russia continues to kill Ukrainians daily.Source: Wall Street JournalMultiple Trump White House officials have ties to antisemitic extremistsWhat Happened: Multiple Trump officials \u2014 including Paul Ingrassia, Rachel Cauley, Ed Martin, Kash Patel, and Kingsley Wilson \u2014 have ties to antisemitic figures and rhetoric. Their actions range from attending Nick Fuentes events and supporting Nazi sympathizer Tim Hale-Cusanelli to pushing antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s inner circle includes individuals with documented links to antisemitism while claiming to fight it. This isn\u2019t just hypocrisy\u2014it\u2019s normalization of hate and extremism at the highest levels of government.Source: NPRAfrikaner Granted Refugee Status by Trump Is Linked to Antisemitic PostsWhat Happened: Charl Kleinhaus, one of 59 Afrikaner refugees flown into the U.S. under a Trump-administered program, has a history of antisemitic social media posts. Despite Trump\u2019s DHS citing antisemitic speech as grounds for deporting pro-Palestinian students and activists, Kleinhaus was granted safe haven and resettled in New York.Why It Matters: Trump is using immigration policy as a political weapon. Palestinian and Muslim immigrants face detention for speech, while white nationalist sympathizers are fast-tracked. Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsStopgap Deals Do Not Mean Donald Trump\u2019s Trade War Is OverWhat Happened: The U.S. and China agreed to a temporary 90-day reduction in tariffs, pausing a trade standoff that had threatened to destabilize the global economy. Investors welcomed the reprieve, but the deeper issues fueling the trade war remain unresolved.Why It Matters: Despite the pause, Trump\u2019s erratic policies have left U.S.\u2013China trade relations more volatile and restrictive than before his presidency. This uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on global markets, supply chains, and business confidence.Source: The EconomistWhite House Eased China Tariffs After Fears of Backlash From Trump\u2019s BaseWhat Happened: Facing backlash from blue-collar workers hurt by steep China tariffs, Trump scaled back penalties after aides warned it was damaging support among \u201cTrump\u2019s people.\u201d Why It Matters: The retreat underscores how Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff policies\u2014announced, reversed, and reissued more than 50 times\u2014are driven by political optics, not strategy.

He\\u2019s led the charge to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\\u2014an agency that regulates Musk\\u2019s companies like Tesla and X. Records show he purged staff, canceled contracts, and diverted enforcement funds.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a textbook case of corrupt self-dealing. A Musk-paid adviser is embedded in the government to destroy a watchdog agency overseeing Musk\\u2019s businesses. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-elon-musk-chris-young-cfpb-tesla-x\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s Middle East Visit Overlaps with Family\\u2019s Expanding Business and Crypto Deals</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> While Trump tours Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, his sons are locking in major real estate, crypto, and luxury deals with Gulf state-backed firms. The Trump Organization is securing new resorts, towers, and a $2 billion crypto investment tied to Trump\\u2019s coin.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is using the presidency to expand his family\\u2019s business empire. Gulf dictators are bankrolling Trump-branded deals while influencing U.S. policy, and foreign policy is being twisted for Trump\\u2019s profit, not America\\u2019s interests. This is global-scale corruption.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-business-interests-family-middle-east-cryptocurrency-cbb7d2354304ce0308800819944cf3f8\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>With Trump Visit, Qatar\\u2019s Image Makeover Scores Another Success</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s red-carpet visit to Qatar \\u2014 including praise for its emir and a possible $400 million luxury jet bribe \\u2014 marks a flip from his 2017 claim that Qatar funds terrorism. The Gulf state spent millions on image rehab, hiring lobbyists like Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, and is now positioned as a key U.S. partner.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> For personal profit, Trump is helping Qatar whitewash its image. He once called it a terror funder, but now he\\u2019s accepting bribes while showering them with praise. Even some MAGA allies say he\\u2019s selling out. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-qatar.html?searchResultPosition=1\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Kills Biden-Era Plan to Limit Sale of Americans' Personal Data</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, led by Russell Vought, has scrapped a Biden-era rule that would have regulated data brokers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule aimed to stop the unchecked sale of Americans\\u2019 personal data.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This rollback leaves Americans exposed to scams, surveillance, and identity theft. It\\u2019s part of a wider Trump effort to gut the CFPB, kill enforcement, and let corporations profit off your private data without accountability.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-administration-scraps-biden-era-plan-limit-sale-americans-personal-data-2025-05-14/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump-Kushner Serbia Hotel Project Stalls After Forgery Scandal</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A top Serbian official admitted to forging a government document that allowed a bombed-out defense complex in Belgrade to be demolished for a $500 million Trump-Kushner luxury hotel project. The fake document stripped the site of protected status, clearing the way for the controversial real estate deal backed by Trump\\u2019s family.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Foreign governments are rewriting laws and faking records to funnel cash and assets to the Trump family in exchange for influence.

Both Tether and Rumble are now deeply tied to El Salvador\\u2019s authoritarian government.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Tether has a history of fraud and money laundering probes. Now it\\u2019s hiding out in El Salvador, enjoying tax breaks and zero oversight. Meanwhile, Trump\\u2019s commerce chief Howard Lutnick is profiting from it while helping write U.S. crypto policy\\u2014an ethical and national security nightmare.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/14/lutnick-el-salvador-crypto-immigration\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>The End of Rule of Law in America</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig warns that Trump\\u2019s second term has marked the collapse of the rule of law. Trump has pardoned insurrectionists, arrested judges, ignored court orders, and weaponized the DOJ to target enemies\\u2014all while defying the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Luttig argues the U.S. is no longer a government of laws. With Trump dismantling judicial independence and centralizing power, American democracy is in existential danger.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/law-america-trump-constitution/682793/\\\\\\\">The Atlantic</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Republicans Slide \\u201CNonprofit Killer\\u201D Law Into Tax Bill</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Republicans have revived the \\u201CStop Terror Financing\\u201D bill by quietly inserting it into their new tax package. The bill lets the Treasury Department revoke tax-exempt status from any nonprofit it suspects of \\u201Cterrorism\\u201D ties\\u2014without due process. Trump\\u2019s White House defines what counts as terrorism.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would give Trump unchecked power to silence opposition groups, from disability advocates to universities, by branding them terrorist-adjacent, and will be used to intimidate nonprofits and chill protest nationwide.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/house-nonprofit-killer-tax-terrorism-support/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Rubio to Restructure National Security Council </h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Marco Rubio is spearheading a drastic overhaul of the National Security Council, planning to slash staff from over 150 to as few as 50 and refocus the NSC from a policy advisory body into one that executes Trump\\u2019s orders.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s overhaul of the National Security Council guts its traditional role of expert coordination. Instead of informing decisions, the NSC will simply carry out Trump\\u2019s orders\\u2014no dissent, no debate. It\\u2019s a move straight from an authoritarian playbook: purge the professionals, concentrate power, and rule through loyalists.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/rubio-working-major-changes-national-security-council-rcna206658\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Homeland Chief Suggests Suspending Habeas Corpus Over Immigration</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Kristi Noem told Congress that current levels of illegal immigration could justify suspending habeas corpus\\u2014the constitutional right to challenge detention. Top Trump advisor Stephen Miller confirmed that Trump is actively considering the move to expedite mass deportations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would pave the way for mass civil liberties violations, indefinite detention, and the erasure of due process. This is authoritarian power disguised as national security.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-homeland-chief-says-illegal-immigration-levels-could-warrant-suspending-2025-05-14/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Gabbard Moves to Control President\\u2019s Daily Brief as Trump Questions Intel Office\\u2019s Role</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tulsi Gabbard is taking control of the President\\u2019s Daily Brief, moving its assembly from CIA headquarters to her own office. She\\u2019s also seized authority over the National Intelligence Council, removing its acting leadership and placing it under her direct oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Gabbard is centralizing power over U.S. intelligence, sidelining career experts, and cutting the CIA out of its traditional role. This marks a dangerous shift\\u2014turning a nonpartisan security process into a tool controlled by a Trump loyalist.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/us/politics/gabbard-president-daily-brief.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Gabbard Fires Intelligence Leaders After Report Contradicts Trump Deportation Claims</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tulsi Gabbard fired the top 2 leaders of the National Intelligence Council\\u2014Mike Collins and Maria Langan-Riekhof\\u2014who oversaw key threat assessments. Their removal follows the NIC\\u2019s release of a report on Venezuelan gang activity that contradicted Trump\\u2019s justification for mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Gabbard\\u2019s purge targets career professionals seen as obstacles to Trump\\u2019s agenda. It\\u2019s part of a broader campaign to politicize intelligence, silence dissent, and suppress facts that conflict with Trump\\u2019s extremist agenda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/14/gabbard-intelligence-venezuela-tren-de-aragua/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Ed Martin, Ousted D.C.

Ed Martin\\u2019s new role will be used to harass political opponents, carry out Trump\\u2019s retribution, and intensify crackdowns on D.C. and immigration\\u2014all under the false banner of \\u201Claw and order.\\u201D</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/13/ed-martin-pardon-attorney/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Plans D.C.

The event could cost up to $45 million, excluding city cleanup and road repair expenses.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a wasteful authoritarian spectacle\\u2014using the U.S. military for a political parade mirrors regimes like Russia and North Korea.

The move follows AP\\u2019s refusal to adopt Trump\\u2019s preferred term \\u201CGulf of America\\u201D in coverage.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The exclusion curtails rapid, broad public access to presidential coverage and further escalates Trump\\u2019s war on the independent press.

This shift has led to raids, detentions, and fear among families, with staff warning the agency is being turned into an enforcement arm.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> A safety agency is now a surveillance tool.
