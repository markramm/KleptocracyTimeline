  "content": "People protest President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to dismantle the Department of Education outside the agency in Washington on Tuesday. Credit:Eric Lee/The New York Times/ReduxShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 12Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump DOJ Moves to Gut Anti-Corruption and Fraud UnitsWhat Happened: The Justice Department is drafting plans to shrink or dismantle units investigating public corruption, foreign bribery, money laundering, and asset recovery. The move follows forced transfers and resignations of career prosecutors, including those handling the now-dropped bribery case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams.Why It Matters: This cripples the DOJ\u2019s ability to hold politicians and corporations accountable, a huge win for Trump and his cronies. It\u2019s a blatant effort to shield Trump\u2019s political allies and block oversight of financial crimes and government corruption.Source: New York TimesTrump Nominee for Housing Regulator Tied to Meme Stock HypeWhat Happened: Bill Pulte, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, was deeply involved in the meme stock craze surrounding Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY). Pulte engaged with investors who believed he had insider knowledge of the stock\u2019s future. He deleted over 24,000 tweets, raising transparency concerns during his confirmation hearings.Why It Matters: Pulte\u2019s involvement in market speculation highlights his judgment and financial credibility as he seeks to oversee $7 trillion in mortgage loans. His deleted tweets and past behavior are alarming, and he should not be handling federal housing policy.Source: Rolling StoneTrump Buys $90,000 Tesla With 37 Safety RecallsWhat Happened: Trump purchased a high-performance Tesla Model S Plaid after turning the White House's South Lawn into a Tesla showroom. The vehicle, priced at nearly $100,000, has been the subject of 37 NHTSA safety recalls, including issues with seat belts, unintended acceleration, and computer failures. A few weeks ago, Musk carried out firings at NHTSA.Why It Matters: This blatant display of cronyism underscores how billionaires like Musk are shaping Trump\u2019s agenda. Musk spent $280 million to help elect Trump, and now the White House is being used as a Tesla sales platform while everyday Americans face layoffs and economic instability.Source: WIREDTrump Pardons Ex-Tennessee Lawmaker Convicted in Campaign Finance SchemeWhat Happened: Former Tennessee state senator Brian Kelsey announced he received a \"full and unconditional pardon\" from Trump, just two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for illegally funneling campaign funds into his failed 2016 congressional bid. Why It Matters: This pardon reinforces Trump\u2019s pattern of using presidential clemency to protect Republican allies convicted of financial crimes. It further erodes accountability for political corruption and signals that GOP officials engaging in illegal campaign finance activities can expect leniency under Trump\u2019s rule. We should also monitor whether Trump is selling pardons.Source: ABC NewsBehold The Golden Age Of Public Corruption In AmericaWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi has gutted the Department of Justice\u2019s Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes public corruption cases. This move shifts corruption investigations away from career prosecutors and into the hands of Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys, making high-level accountability nearly impossible.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s second term has already ushered in a new era of unchecked corruption, dismantling key oversight mechanisms. With the DOJ now weaponized to protect Trump\u2019s allies while punishing opponents, the rule of law is crumbling, paving the way for systemic abuses of power.Source: Mother JonesTrump Official Tasked With Defending DOGE Cuts Used Office for Fashion InfluencingWhat Happened: McLaurine Pinover, the chief spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management, used her federal office to film Instagram fashion influencer videos, directing followers to a commission-based shopping site. At the same time, she defended mass federal layoffs ordered by Musk. Pinover deleted her Instagram account after CNN reached out to her.Why It Matters: While tens of thousands of federal workers are losing jobs, Pinover promoted $475 skirts from her government office. In normal times, this would violate rules against using government property for personal gain.

Johnson described his job as speaker as a balancing act between managing House Republicans, Trump, and Musk\u2014who holds unchecked power over the government. Why It Matters: The Speaker of the House openly acknowledged that Congress is no longer an independent branch of government\u2014 instead controlled by an unelected billionaire and an authoritarian president. Legislative decisions are no longer made by elected representatives but dictated by Trump and Musk, who wield their influence to dismantle federal agencies and manipulate policy for their agendas.Source: PoliticoKey Project 2025: Authors Now Staffing the Trump RegimeWhat Happened: Despite Trump \u201cdisavowing\u201d the Project 2025 policy blueprint during his campaign, several of its key contributors now hold top positions in his regime. These individuals are actively implementing Project 2025\u2019s radical agenda, including gutting federal agencies, slashing government jobs, and reshaping trade and economic policy.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s Cabinet and executive branch are now stacked with Project 2025 architects, meaning its extremist blueprint for dismantling democracy is being executed in real time to centralize power, deregulate industry, and erode democratic institutions.Source: NBC News\"The President Wanted It and I Did It\": Recording Reveals Social Security Chief\u2019s Thoughts on DOGE and TrumpWhat Happened: In a leaked recording, acting Social Security Commissioner Leland Dudek admitted that Trump and Elon Musk are driving massive cuts at the Social Security Administration. He acknowledged that Trump\u2019s claims of Social Security fraud are lies and is following orders from the White House despite his reservations. The SSA is slashing 7,000 jobs, closing regional offices, cutting disability services, and even considering outsourcing customer service.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting Social Security while spreading disinformation to justify cuts. Dudek\u2019s admission confirms that Musk\u2019s so-called \u201cefficiency\u201d efforts are destabilizing the agency, causing system crashes and delays. Millions of elderly and disabled Americans rely on Social Security, but its future is now in jeopardy.Source: ProPublicaTrump takes an ax to more than a dozen pollution rules in rapid-fire deregulationWhat Happened: Trump rolled back 31 environmental regulations in just two hours, gutting pollution controls for power plants, vehicles, and air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency also announced plans to challenge the scientific basis for regulating climate pollution.Why It Matters: These moves mark a devastating shift in environmental policy, prioritizing industry profits over public health. There will be dire consequences, including increased pollution, health risks, and climate instability. Source: CNNTrump Ousts NEH Chair Shelly Lowe as He Reshapes Cultural InstitutionsWhat Happened: Trump directed Shelly C. Lowe, the first Native American to lead the National Endowment for the Humanities, to step down. Michael McDonald, NEH\u2019s general counsel, will serve as acting chairman.Why It Matters: This aligns with Trump\u2019s aggressive overhaul of arts and cultural agencies, including leadership changes at the Kennedy Center and cuts to federal arts preservation programs. His executive orders dismantling DEI initiatives have thrown NEH funding into legal uncertainty.Source: The Washington PostTrump, Musk Stoke Fears of Social Security Cuts with \u2018Fraud\u2019 RhetoricWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are escalating lies about widespread fraud in Social Security, fueling fears that they are laying the groundwork for massive cuts to the program. Musk suggested in a Fox Business interview that entitlement programs should be eliminated, citing $500 billion to $700 billion in \u201cwaste.\u201d He has also called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d Why It Matters: These lies directly contradict Trump\u2019s and the GOP\u2019s previous assurances that Social Security benefits would remain untouched and plan to dismantle and privatize it. Democrats warn that Musk is setting the stage for deep cuts disguised as \u201cfraud\u201d prevention. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted Musk\u2019s comments as \u201ca pretext to slashing\u201d benefits for millions of Americans. Bottom line: Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEPA Workers Silenced as Agency Cancels Hundreds of GrantsWhat Happened: The EPA has cut off communication with grant recipients and quietly canceled hundreds of environmental grants that fund clean water, disaster preparedness, and emissions reduction projects. Staff have been prohibited from speaking to grantees, leaving critical programs in limbo.Why It Matters: The move cripples environmental initiatives nationwide, hitting rural and tribal communities hardest. With funding frozen and no explanation given, essential projects for clean air, water, and climate resilience are being abandoned.Source: ABC NewsUSDA Suspends Maine University Funding Over Trump\u2019s Trans Athlete OrderWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended $30 million in research and program funding for the University of Maine after Governor Janet Mills refused to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. The USDA cited a need to evaluate potential \u201ccivil rights\u201d violations at the university.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal funding to punish states that reject his extremist policies, using economic coercion to enforce discriminatory mandates. This sets a dangerous precedent, with the federal government retaliating against states and institutions for upholding civil rights protections.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s DOJ Subpoenas NY Migrant Shelter for Resident NamesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime subpoenaed a Manhattan hotel sheltering undocumented migrants, demanding resident names, birthdates, and IDs. The DOJ also seeks details on NYC officials\u2019 funding migrant programs.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DOJ is openly weaponizing federal power to track, surveil, and deport undocumented residents on a massive scale. This crackdown extends beyond migrant shelters to sanctuary cities and activists. Trump is escalating authoritarian tactics that trample civil liberties and criminalize dissent.Source: The GuardianCongress to Investigate Attacks on Tesla Owners as GOP Shields MuskWhat Happened: House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a congressional investigation into alleged attacks against Tesla owners and vehicles, framing it as \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d orchestrated by the \u201cradical Left.\u201d Johnson provided no evidence for his claims but vowed to involve the DOJ and FBI in pursuing perpetrators.Why It Matters: This marks yet another weaponization of Congress to protect Musk instead of addressing real crises like Social Security cuts, mass firings, or environmental deregulation. Republicans are using taxpayer resources to shield a billionaire from public scrutiny. Musk, in turn, continues consolidating power while influencing policy decisions that benefit his business empire.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTennessee\u2019s Push to Jail Officials for Backing Immigration \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 Raises AlarmWhat Happened: Tennessee passed a law making it a felony for local officials, such as city council members and school board representatives, to vote in favor of \"sanctuary city\" policies. Lawmakers who defy the state\u2019s immigration stance could face at least one year in prison, fines, and removal from office.Why It Matters: This unprecedented move criminalizes elected officials for their votes, raising serious concerns about authoritarian overreach. Progressive lawmakers warn that it undermines democracy by intimidating local officials into compliance with conservative policies.

An email claimed a pipe bomb was placed in her mailbox, signed with \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d No device was found.Why It Matters: The threat highlights rising intimidation tactics against judges and their families amid an increasingly volatile political climate. Barrett has faced backlash from conservatives over recent rulings, though no direct link has been established. Source: CNNTrump Escalates War on Legal EstablishmentWhat Happened: Trump is targeting law firms, stripping security clearances, blocking federal contracts, and blacklisting firms tied to Democrats and DEI programs. Perkins Coie was banned from federal buildings, and its lawyers lost security clearances. The White House is threatening to investigate other firms over hiring practices.Why It Matters: Legal experts call this an unprecedented attack on the right to legal representation, likening it to Nixon\u2019s \u201cenemies list\u201d. Law firms are fearful of retribution, undermining fundamental legal protections in the U.S.Source: CNN\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump DOJ Drops Lawsuit Against Migrant Shelter Accused of Child Sexual AbuseWhat Happened: The Justice Department abruptly dismissed a civil rights lawsuit against Southwest Key Programs, the largest provider of shelters for unaccompanied migrant children, despite allegations of sexual abuse and harassment spanning nearly a decade. The lawsuit, filed in 2024, accused Southwest Key employees of rape, solicitation of sex acts, and other abuses.Why It Matters: Dropping the case lets an accused shelter off the hook and denies justice to the children who suffered sexual abuse. The National Center for Youth Law is fighting to keep the case alive, arguing that the decision shields wrongdoing. Senator Grassley is pressing the DOJ for answers.Source: Reuters\u2018Students will suffer harm\u2019: Education Department\u2019s civil rights office gutted by layoffs, closuresWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s layoffs at the Department of Education have eliminated nearly half of the Office for Civil Rights' staff, including entire regional offices in New York, Chicago, and Dallas. The cuts put thousands of discrimination cases\u2014ranging from disability accommodations to sexual violence complaints\u2014into limbo.Why It Matters: These layoffs effectively dismantle federal enforcement of civil rights in education, leaving students and families without recourse for discrimination. With fewer than 300 staff members remaining, the backlog of cases will likely take years to address, harming students.Source: CNNThousands of Afghans Who Helped U.S. Military Blocked from Reaching American SoilWhat Happened: Over 40,000 vetted Afghan refugees remain stranded after Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program and Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze federal funding for their travel. This includes 2,800 unaccompanied minors in the U.S. and thousands of families still separated years after the chaotic 2021 withdrawal. Those approved for resettlement must now pay their way or remain in danger.Why It Matters: Afghans who risked their lives for the U.S. military are now trapped in limbo, many in danger under Taliban rule. The lack of urgency from the U.S. government raises serious humanitarian and national security concerns as allies are left behind.Source: CBS NewsEducation Department Layoffs Threaten Support for Students with DisabilitiesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass layoffs at the Education Department have cut nearly half the staff at the Office for Civil Rights and over 100 employees from the Institute of Education Sciences. Why It Matters: Federal enforcement of disability rights is collapsing, leaving students with autism, intellectual disabilities, and special needs without legal protection or research-backed educational support. With the dismantling of the department underway, schools will be left without resources to serve disabled students effectively.Source: NBC NewsU.S. Citizen Child Recovering from Brain Cancer Deported with Undocumented ParentsWhat Happened: A 10-year-old U.S. citizen recovering from brain cancer was deported to Mexico along with her undocumented parents after being detained at a Texas immigration checkpoint while en route to an emergency medical checkup in Houston. The parents had no criminal history and had previously passed through the checkpoint without issue by showing medical and legal documents.Why It Matters: This cruel and heartbreaking deportation raises serious human rights and legal concerns, as a critically ill U.S. citizen child has been forced out of the country, jeopardizing her life-saving treatment. Source: NBC NewsEducation Department Mass Firings Target Civil Rights and Student Aid OfficesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass layoffs at the Department of Education have eliminated nearly 1,300 jobs, including civil rights attorneys, student aid specialists, and regulatory staff. Documents obtained by Politico reveal that seven of the department\u2019s 12 regional civil rights offices\u2014including those in Boston, Dallas, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco\u2014were shut down. Financial aid oversight specialists and IT personnel were also cut.Why It Matters: The move guts federal oversight of education and threatens protections for students with disabilities, victims of discrimination, and those reliant on financial aid. Source: PoliticoInside Trump\u2019s Crackdown on Dissent: Obscure Laws, ICE Agents and FearWhat Happened: Trump arrested and moved to deport lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil, citing an obscure legal provision that claims his pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University harmed U.S. foreign policy interests. Why It Matters: Trump is using immigration laws to punish political speech. Civil rights advocates warn this is part of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on dissent, leveraging federal agencies and legal loopholes to silence opposition. The arrest sets a dangerous precedent for punishing all activists based on their political views.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchSocial Security Reverses Plan to Cut Phone Services After BacklashWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration scrapped Musk\u2019s plans to eliminate phone services for millions of retirees and disabled Americans following a Washington Post report exposing the proposal. The cuts would have severely impacted seniors and disabled individuals who rely on phone access for claims.Why It Matters: This reversal underscores the chaos and risks of Trump\u2019s deep government cuts. The plan, part of a broader 12% workforce reduction, has already led to longer wait times and service disruptions. Musk\u2019s cuts are gutting critical government functions, disproportionately harming vulnerable populations.Source: The Washington PostDOGE Fires NIH Lab Leak Prevention StaffWhat Happened: Trump and Musk fired 20 NIH employees responsible for lab safety and preventing pathogen leaks. These cuts were part of a broader purge of probationary workers across federal agencies in February.Why It Matters: The Division of Occupational Health and Safety is critical in preventing biosafety lab accidents and maintaining scientific safety standards. Experts warn that fewer trained personnel will increase the risk of lab leaks, endangering the public.Source: NOTUSTrump Slashes Mental Health and Addiction AgencyWhat Happened: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration faces severe cuts, with 50% of its staff being eliminated and regional offices shutting down. The agency, which oversees the National Suicide Lifeline, opioid treatment programs, and drug courts, has been unresponsive to state and nonprofit partners as the downsizing takes effect.Why It Matters: SAMHSA plays a critical role in addressing the U.S. mental health and addiction crisis, and its programs have contributed to a decline in overdose deaths since 2023. These cuts will increase relapse rates, overwhelm healthcare systems, and worsen mental health outcomes.Source: New York TimesConfusion, Fear as Defense Workforce Faces Mass Firings and ChaosWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s purge, hiring freezes, and new administrative burdens have thrown the Defense Department into turmoil. Secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to fire 5,400 probationary employees and cut up to 8% of the civilian workforce. Meanwhile, workers who applied for an early resignation package have been left in limbo, unsure of their status.Why It Matters: The cuts are demoralizing civilian employees, disrupting military readiness, endangering national security, and creating inefficiencies rather than improving operations. Workforce reductions are being carried out with little transparency, leaving thousands of employees uncertain about their futures while administrative chaos grows.Source: Defense OneNOAA Braces for Mass Layoffs, Fueling Concerns About Lifesaving Weather ServicesWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to lay off over 1,000 NOAA employees, slashing its workforce by 25% since January. The cuts come as agencies submit their \u201creduction in force\u201d plans, with NOAA forced to eliminate entire functions, not just personnel.Why It Matters: These cuts threaten essential weather forecasting, storm warnings, and climate monitoring just as hurricane and wildfire seasons approach. This will endanger public safety and disaster response, putting lives at risk.Source: ABC NewsMass Exodus at HHS as Buyouts, Layoffs Accelerate Under Trump What Happened: The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a wave of resignations as employees are pressured into buyouts offering up to $25,000 to leave their jobs. Trump and RFK Jr. have already purged 5,200 probationary employees.Why It Matters: The gutting of HHS destabilizes public health at a time of rising global threats and bird flu and measles outbreaks. Experts warn that critical programs for infectious disease response, medical research, and public health policy are being hollowed out. The chaos and uncertainty are forcing dedicated professionals to choose between staying under duress or abandoning vital work.Source: Mother JonesFederal Student Loan Site Crashes After Trump\u2019s Education Dept. LayoffsWhat Happened: The federal student loan website, StudentAid.gov, suffered a major outage one day after Trump gutted the Department of Education, eliminating half its workforce. The layoffs included IT staff responsible for maintaining FAFSA systems, leaving students unable to complete financial aid applications.Why It Matters: With the Education Department in chaos, essential services like student loan processing and financial aid applications are being disrupted. The outage underscores the dangers of dismantling the department, potentially leaving millions of students in financial limbo.Source: Associated PressEducation Department Cuts Agency That Compiles \u2018Nation\u2019s Report Card\u2019What Happened: Trump has eliminated nearly all 130 staffers at the National Center for Education Statistics, the agency responsible for collecting education data and issuing the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the \"Nation\u2019s Report Card.\"Why It Matters: With NCES gutted, policymakers and the public will lose access to crucial data measuring student performance, teacher effectiveness, and school safety. Source: ABC NewsEPA Takes Aim at Water, Air, and Toxic Protections in Massive Deregulation PushWhat Happened: The EPA launched the biggest deregulation campaign in U.S. history, gutting emissions standards, reversing climate protections, and challenging the scientific basis of greenhouse gas regulations.Why It Matters: The rollback allows polluters to emit unlimited carbon, toxins, and wastewater, endangering public health and worsening climate change. With protections dismantled, Americans face dirtier air, water, and higher risks of environmental disasters. A full-scale war on science.Source: ABC NewsTrump's EPA Administrator Eliminates Environmental Justice and DEI OfficesWhat Happened: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has shut down all DEI offices across the agency, including closing 10 regional Environmental Justice Divisions and placing 168 employees on administrative leave at headquarters. Why It Matters: The elimination of environmental justice programs disproportionately harms low-income communities and communities of color, which are most affected by pollution and climate change. This marks another rollback of civil rights and environmental protections, prioritizing corporate interests and endangering the public.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGreenlanders say no to Trump as rare earths loom over coalition talksWhat Happened: Greenland\u2019s opposition center-right Demokraatit party won the most votes in a surprising national election, dealing a blow to Trump\u2019s ambitions of acquiring the Arctic island. Why It Matters: Trump has repeated his plans to acquire Greenland, threatening military force or economic coercion to secure its strategic location and rare earth resources. The election results reflect strong opposition to U.S. interference.Source: PoliticoKremlin-Linked Document Outlines Hard-Line Negotiating StanceWhat Happened: A classified document from a Moscow-based think tank close to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) lays out maximalist demands for ending their genocidal war. It rejects Trump\u2019s proposal for a \u201cpeace deal\u201d within 100 days as \u201cimpossible\u201d and calls for the dismantling of Ukraine\u2019s government, territorial carve-ups, and full recognition of Russia\u2019s seized land. The document also proposes fueling tensions between Trump and U.S. allies and offering U.S. access to rare-earth metals in illegally occupied Ukrainian territories as leverage.Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s demands align with Trump\u2019s actions to date, as he has already pushed their agenda before meeting with Russian officials. It\u2019s as if the Kremlin handed the White House a blueprint, and Trump is executing it step by step.Source: The Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchMacron: Europe Must Prepare to Defend Ukraine Without U.S. AssistanceWhat Happened: French President Emmanuel Macron warned that Europe must be ready to defend Ukraine if Trump pulls U.S. support. Macron called for increased European military investment to counter Russia\u2019s ongoing threat.Why It Matters: With Trump aligning with Moscow, Europe is forced to rethink its defense strategy. Macron\u2019s statement signals a major shift toward European military independence, a move that will reshape NATO and EU defense policies.Source: NBC NewsEU Chief Diplomat Warns of Russia\u2019s \u2018State-Sponsored Terrorism\u2019 Against EuropeWhat Happened: The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, accused Russia and Iran of conducting \"state-sponsored terrorism\" against Europe. An investigation revealed that pro-Russian groups are offering cryptocurrency payments for sabotage, disinformation, and cyberattacks across the continent.

He deleted over 24,000 tweets, raising transparency concerns during his confirmation hearings.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Pulte\\u2019s involvement in market speculation highlights his judgment and financial credibility as he seeks to oversee $7 trillion in mortgage loans.

A few weeks ago, Musk carried out firings at NHTSA.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This blatant display of cronyism underscores how billionaires like Musk are shaping Trump\\u2019s agenda.

At the same time, she defended mass federal layoffs ordered by Musk. Pinover deleted her Instagram account after CNN reached out to her.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> While tens of thousands of federal workers are losing jobs, Pinover promoted $475 skirts from her government office.

Johnson described his job as speaker as a balancing act between managing House Republicans, Trump, and Musk\\u2014who holds unchecked power over the government. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Speaker of the House openly acknowledged that Congress is no longer an independent branch of government\\u2014 instead controlled by an unelected billionaire and an authoritarian president.
