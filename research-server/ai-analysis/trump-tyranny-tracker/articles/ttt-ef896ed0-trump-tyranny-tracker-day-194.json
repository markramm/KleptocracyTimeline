REUTERS/Andrew KellyShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 1Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 10Google Meet: August 5, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZy1r1meEiaX6wAOHwmzgnnT3Hbz71zZFu0atASmCtEQ9xog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsQualcomm gave $1 million to pro-Trump dark money groupWhat Happened: Qualcomm contributed $1 million to Securing American Greatness, a Trump-aligned nonprofit that bankrolled his 2024 campaign and is now funding ads to push his tax agenda and elect GOP candidates. The group, run by Trump insiders, spent $81 million during the election while keeping its donor list hidden.Why It Matters: This is the first confirmed corporate donation to Trump\u2019s dark money network, exposing how major tech firms are covertly bankrolling his political machine while shielding their involvement from public scrutiny.Source: CREWCorporate America has largely abandoned its post-January 6 promises on democracyWhat Happened: Despite pledges to cut ties after January 6, more than 2,000 corporate and industry PACs have funneled $174 million to lawmakers who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Major donors include Koch Industries, AT&T, and American Crystal Sugar. Speaker Mike Johnson and other key conspirators have seen donations surge as they consolidate power.Why It Matters: Corporate America is bankrolling authoritarianism. Companies that vowed to uphold democracy are instead financing politicians who tried to overturn an election and were involved in an insurrection, fueling Trump\u2019s autocratic agenda and corroding the rule of law that underpins free markets and political stability.Source: CREWMarkwayne Mullin Violated the STOCK Act by Failing to Disclose Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in TradesWhat Happened: Sen. Markwayne Mullin violated the STOCK Act by failing to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock and bond trades for up to 2.5 years. The late filings, involving trades by Mullin and his wife, were attributed to \u201cdelayed amendments,\u201d with his office stating that an outside firm manages his portfolio.Why It Matters: This violation underscores how lawmakers often circumvent transparency rules designed to prevent insider trading. It underscores why Congress should face a full ban on stock trading as public trust in lawmakers\u2019 financial integrity continues to erode.Source: NOTUSMajor Corporations Reported Bigger Donations to Trump\u2019s Inauguration Than His Committee DisclosedWhat Happened: General Motors, Amazon, Microsoft, and USAA admitted to Congress that they contributed far more to Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration than originally reported to the FEC. GM gave $1.54 million vs. $1 million reported, Amazon nearly $2 million vs. $1 million, Microsoft $1 million vs. $750K, and USAA also revealed discrepancies. Trump\u2019s committee amended filings but blamed corporate \u201cdocumentation errors.\u201dWhy It Matters: These underreported donations show how corporations can funnel millions into Trump\u2019s political machine with no oversight. With a paralyzed FEC, pay-to-play politics and hidden corporate influence over the presidency go unchecked, eroding transparency and accountability.Source: NOTUS\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsStates Have More Data About You Than the Feds Do. Trump Wants to See ItWhat Happened: Trump is ordering states to hand over massive amounts of personal data from Medicaid, food assistance programs, and voter rolls to federal agencies. While officials claim it\u2019s to combat \u201cfraud\u201d and enforce immigration laws, it\u2019s actually a power grab.Why It Matters: This is Trump\u2019s most aggressive bid yet to centralize state-held data into a universal surveillance system. It threatens privacy and state sovereignty while giving his regime tools to target immigrants, monitor political opponents, and fabricate claims of voter fraud.Source: New York TimesFederal Reserve Governor Kugler steps down, giving Trump slot to fillWhat Happened: Adriana Kugler announced she will step down next week, months before her term ends. This gives Trump a chance to appoint a new governor who could later be elevated to chair when Powell\u2019s term ends in 2026.Why It Matters: Trump has relentlessly attacked Powell for resisting rate cuts and wants to stack the Fed with loyalists. Kugler\u2019s exit accelerates his plan to politicize the central bank, threatening its independence and destabilizing both the U.S. and global economy.Source: Associated PressTrump firings mount as staffers\u2019 loyalty is called into questionWhat Happened: Over a dozen senior officials have been purged, many after far-right extremist Laura Loomer flagged them as \u201cdisloyal.\u201d Loomer, who boasts of direct access to Trump and West Wing staff, has helped orchestrate purges across the Pentagon, National Security Council, DOJ, FDA, and intelligence agencies, with hundreds more terminations reportedly planned.Why It Matters: This is a systematic purge of experienced officials, replacing them with loyalists and outside enforcers. The regime\u2019s internal \u201ctip line\u201d for rooting out staff mirrors authoritarian tactics, undermining national security and dismantling institutional independence.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsGhislaine Maxwell Moved to Minimum-Security Women\u2019s Prison in TexasWhat Happened: Ghislaine Maxwell, serving 20 years for child sex trafficking over 1,000 kids with Jeffrey Epstein, was quietly moved to a low-security Texas prison offering yoga and Pilates classes. The transfer came after a meeting with Trump\u2019s Deputy AG Todd Blanche, where she reportedly \u201cnamed\u201d 100 people tied to Epstein while seeking a pardon or reduced sentence.Why It Matters: This is extraordinary leniency for a convicted child sex trafficker. Victims call it \u201cpreferential treatment,\u201d raising alarms that DOJ cut a secret deal\u2014trading \u201cinfo\u201d shielding Trump for comfort and possibly a pardon\u2014while Epstein files remain hidden. A special waiver let Maxwell into this Club Med prison, which normally bans sex traffickers.Source: New York TimesComer agrees to postpone Maxwell\u2019s testimony to House on EpsteinWhat Happened: House Oversight Chair James Comer agreed to delay Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony until after the Supreme Court reviews her appeal to overturn her sex-trafficking conviction. Comer denied her requests for immunity and advance questions but kept the subpoena for a future deposition on Epstein\u2019s non-prosecution deal and death.Why It Matters: The delay shields Trump while DOJ orchestrates a massive cover-up of Epstein\u2019s network, stalling accountability and blocking a probe that could expose powerful allies.Source: The HillFBI Redacted Trump\u2019s Name in Epstein Files for Privacy ReasonsWhat Happened: The FBI redacted Trump\u2019s name and other high-profile figures from Jeffrey Epstein case files, citing privacy because they were private citizens when the probe began. Over 1,000 agents reviewed 100,000 documents, flagging any mention of Trump, but DOJ and FBI ultimately concluded \u201cno further disclosure\u201d was warranted.Why It Matters: This sweeping redaction shields Trump and other elites from scrutiny, fueling claims of a coordinated DOJ cover-up to bury evidence on Epstein\u2019s network and protect powerful allies. And a reminder that just weeks ago, Trump and the DOJ claimed no such files even existed.Source: BloombergAppeals Court Allows Trump Order That Ends Union Protections for Federal WorkersWhat Happened: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Trump, allowing his order to strip over a million federal workers of collective bargaining rights to move forward. While agencies were told to hold off fully ending agreements until litigation concludes, Trump is now free to execute the order at his discretion.Why It Matters: This is a major victory for Trump\u2019s effort to purge and control the federal workforce. By dismantling union protections under a vague \u201cnational security\u201d claim, the ruling clears the way for mass purges and loyalty-based hiring across the government\u2014central to consolidating power.Source: New York TimesSenate Democrats call for probe into DOJ settlement over HPE-Juniper mergerWhat Happened: Four Senate Democrats called for an investigation into the DOJ\u2019s decision to settle a lawsuit blocking Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. The settlement followed the purge of top antitrust officials, internal disputes over merger enforcement, and reports of political lobbying tied to Trump.Why It Matters: The settlement, criticized for enabling harmful market consolidation, highlights growing political interference in antitrust enforcement. Lawmakers warn it sets a dangerous precedent for corporate mega-deals to be forced through under White House pressure instead of undergoing independent legal review.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Fires Labor Statistics Chief After Weak Jobs ReportWhat Happened: Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer hours after a report showed U.S. hiring slowed sharply. Without evidence, he accused her of \u201crigging\u201d data to hurt Republicans. McEntarfer, a Biden appointee with decades of service, was replaced by her deputy.Why It Matters: Trump wants to mirror Russia\u2019s practice of fabricating data to protect his power. By purging independent statisticians, he undermines trusted U.S. economic reporting, threatening markets, policymaking, and accountability. As in Russia, no data from this regime can be trusted going forward.Source: NBC News and Wall Street JournalCorporation for Public Broadcasting to close after funding cut, in blow to local mediaWhat Happened: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which has funded PBS, NPR, and over 1,500 local stations for nearly 60 years, will shut down after Congress cut $1.1 billion in federal funding. Most staff will be laid off by September, with full closure set for January 2026.Why It Matters: This dismantles a cornerstone of U.S. public media, crippling local journalism and depriving communities of vital news and educational programming. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader attack on independent media and public broadcasting.Source: ReutersColumbia University to Aid Trump Policing of Foreign Students Under SettlementWhat Happened: Columbia University agreed to pay $221 million and assist Trump in monitoring foreign students to regain federal funding. The settlement requires Columbia to report minor offenses, including protest-related trespassing, to federal immigration authorities and take steps to reduce financial reliance on international students.Why It Matters: This sets a dangerous precedent for universities acting as immigration enforcers, threatening academic freedom and dissent while deterring foreign talent. With nearly 40% of Columbia\u2019s students from abroad, the deal would reshape enrollment and erode campuses as centers of resistance.Source: BloombergProminent historian cancels course at Columbia University over Trump dealWhat Happened: Prominent historian Rashid Khalidi canceled his fall lecture at Columbia University, denouncing its $200 million settlement with Trump. The deal expands pro-Israel programs, places Middle East curricula under federal oversight, and limits diversity initiatives, sparking backlash for eroding academic freedom and punishing pro-Palestinian speech.Why It Matters: Columbia is a test case for Trump\u2019s drive to control higher education, leveraging federal funding threats to reshape curricula and silence dissent. It sets a dangerous precedent for government-enforced ideological conformity across U.S. universities and schools.Source: The GuardianTrump Freezes $339M in UCLA Research FundsWhat Happened: Trump has frozen over $300 million in research funding for UCLA, accusing the university of \u201cillegal affirmative action, antisemitism, and discrimination\u201d over transgender athlete participation. The freeze, affecting grants from multiple federal agencies, follows a DOJ finding that UCLA \u201cviolated\u201d civil rights laws.Why It Matters: UCLA is the latest target in Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on higher education, using funding threats to dismantle diversity initiatives and reshape campus policies. This politicized defunding endangers critical research and undermines academic freedom nationwide.Source: New York TimesCornell Close to White House Settlement of Up to $100 MillionWhat Happened: The White House is negotiating a deal of up to $100 million with Cornell University to restore frozen federal research funding. The settlement, modeled after Columbia\u2019s $221 million agreement, follows Trump\u2019s probes into alleged \u201cantisemitism and political bias\u201d on campuses. Brown University reached a similar $50 million deal this week.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown on universities, using funding threats to extort schools, dismantle DEI programs, and impose political control over higher education\u2014reshaping academia under direct White House pressure to enforce MAGA ideology.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsGeorgia detainee with prosthetic legs who objected to flooded cell sent to solitaryWhat Happened: Rodney Taylor, a double amputee in ICE detention, was placed in solitary confinement after refusing a flooded cell that could damage his prosthetic legs. He\u2019s endured months without proper medical care while awaiting a green card decision.Why It Matters: This underscores the medical neglect and abuse of disabled immigrants under Trump\u2019s mass deportation push, with detention centers ill-equipped to meet basic human rights standards, resulting in clear human rights violations.Source: The Guardian\u2018Can We Extradite Him?\u2019 How U.S. Officials Grappled With the Release of a Triple MurdererWhat Happened: In a controversial prisoner swap with Venezuela, Trump officials secured the release of 10 Americans, including Dahud Hanid Ortiz, a U.S. Army veteran convicted of murdering three people in Spain. Internal State Department emails show officials debated hiding Ortiz\u2019s inclusion and even considered extraditing him after his return to the U.S.Why It Matters: While Trump\u2019s regime is deporting and disappearing immigrants with no criminal records, it allowed a convicted triple murderer to walk free on American soil. The move undermines Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d narrative.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchScientists slam Trump administration climate report as a \u2018farce\u2019 full of misinformationWhat Happened: Trump officials released a climate report defending their plan to scrap greenhouse gas limits, written by five fringe scientists without peer review. Experts say it distorts research, recycles fossil fuel\u2013backed denial, and aims to dismantle nearly all U.S. climate regulations.Why It Matters: The report politicizes science to advance Trump\u2019s pro-fossil fuel agenda, undermining environmental protections amid worsening climate disasters\u2014while rewarding his donors.Source: The GuardianTrump Blocks Funding for CDC Health ProgramsWhat Happened: The White House budget office directed a freeze on hundreds of millions in CDC funds, blocking programs for youth violence prevention, gun injury research, diabetes, kidney disease, and tobacco control. This follows a similar attempt to withhold $15 billion from NIH before reversing under pressure.Why It Matters: Trump officials continue defying Congress to choke off funding for critical health programs, undermining disease prevention, public safety research, and transparency in federal spending\u2014risking long-term public health harm to Americans.Source: Wall Street JournalAMA and other medical associations are kicked out of CDC vaccine workgroupsWhat Happened: The CDC expelled top medical associations, including the AMA and American Academy of Pediatrics, from vaccine policy workgroups after previously purging the entire advisory committee.Why It Matters: This sidelines medical expertise and hands vaccine policy to extremists, undermining public health guidance, eroding trust in immunization programs, and endangering Americans.Source: Associated PressFired vaccine board members warn of fallout from RFK Jr. policiesWhat Happened: Former members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel condemned RFK Jr. for purging all 17 board members and replacing them with anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists. In a New England Journal of Medicine article, they warned that the move abandons scientific rigor, undermines trust, and risks widespread infectious disease outbreaks.Why It Matters: This purge dismantles decades of evidence-based vaccine policymaking. With federal health guidance now driven by ideology, experts warn independent medical groups may need to step in to protect public health.Source: The HillUS government turmoil stalls thousands of export approvals, sources sayWhat Happened: Thousands of export license applications are stalled as dysfunction within Trump\u2019s Commerce Department paralyzes approvals. Staff departures, halted rulemaking, and poor communication under Secretary Howard Lutnick have left U.S. companies\u2014including Nvidia\u2014unable to ship billions in goods and technology.Why It Matters: The unprecedented backlog is crippling American exporters, straining trade relationships, and exposing deeper chaos in federal trade policy.Source: ReutersJudge allows the National Science Foundation to withhold hundreds of millions of research dollarsWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that the National Science Foundation can continue withholding hundreds of millions in research funding while litigation from 16 Democrat-led states proceeds. The cuts have halted grants for studies on AI, disinformation, PTSD in veterans, STEM education, and diversity in science.Why It Matters: The ruling lets Trump keep reshaping U.S. research funding, gutting innovation, inclusion, and scientific leadership. Experts warn that it risks long-term damage to America\u2019s competitiveness in STEM fields.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGermany to Deliver Air Defense System to Ukraine After AttackWhat Happened: Germany will send two more Patriot air-defense launchers to Ukraine after Russia\u2019s deadly drone and missile strike on Kyiv killed 31 people, including 5 children. Berlin will supply systems from its own stockpiles, and Washington will later replace them from defense industry reserves.Why It Matters: The desperately needed launchers will bolster Ukraine\u2019s defenses against Russia\u2019s escalating, genocidal air attacks. Germany will receive more from future U.S. production.Source: BloombergTrump ally Bukele secures path to indefinite reelections in El SalvadorWhat Happened: El Salvador\u2019s legislature passed sweeping constitutional amendments removing presidential term limits, extending terms to six years, eliminating run-offs, and syncing presidential and congressional elections. The move cements President Nayib Bukele\u2019s path to rule indefinitely.Why It Matters: Bukele\u2019s indefinite rule, backed by Trump, strengthens anti-democratic alliances in the region and raises serious concerns over human rights and electoral integrity.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchUkrainians Mourn 31 Killed in Russia\u2019s Deadliest Strike on Kyiv This YearWhat Happened: Russian drone and missile strikes on Kyiv murdered 31 people, including 5 children, in the deadliest attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital this year. Over 150 were injured, with another drone strike hitting Kharkiv and wounding 10, including infants. Despite Trump calling Russia\u2019s actions \u201cdisgusting,\u201d he has yet to commit to sanctions or substantial military aid for Ukraine.Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s genocidal war is murdering Ukrainian civilians daily while global powers hesitate. Trump\u2019s lack of concrete action emboldens Russia\u2019s daily terror campaign.Source: ReutersTrump Says He Ordered Subs Repositioned in Rare Nuclear Threat to RussiaWhat Happened: Trump claimed he ordered U.S. nuclear submarines repositioned after online threats from former Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. It\u2019s unclear if submarines were actually moved\u2014and unnecessary, since U.S. subs can strike targets globally. Why It Matters: Instead of sending Ukraine the weapons it desperately needs to stop Russia\u2019s genocidal assault, Trump is engaging in empty nuclear theatrics on Truth Social. With the U.S. withholding critical aid and undermining Kyiv, these stunts do nothing to deter Russia or help Ukraine win the war.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsUS adds just 73,000 jobs in July amid pressure from Trump\u2019s trade warWhat Happened: The US added just 73,000 jobs in July as unemployment rose to 4.2%, with major downward revisions to past months. Trump blamed \u201cfaked\u201d data and fired the labor statistics chief while tariffs and federal job cuts slowed hiring.Why It Matters: The weak jobs report underscores the growing economic toll of Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs and sweeping federal purge. By firing independent statisticians, Trump mirrors authoritarian regimes like Russia, where data is manipulated to protect those in power\u2014undermining trust in U.S. institutions and policymaking.Source: The GuardianEmployers Pull Back on Hiring as Uncertainty Weighs on PlansWhat Happened: The U.S. added just 73,000 jobs in July as businesses scaled back hiring amid economic uncertainty tied to Trump\u2019s tariffs, immigration restrictions, and federal job cuts. Previous months\u2019 gains were revised down by 258,000 jobs, manufacturing shed workers for a third month, and federal employment has dropped by 84,000 this year.Why It Matters: The slowing labor market shows Trump\u2019s economic policies are stalling growth and discouraging expansion. With tariffs driving up costs and businesses on edge, economists warn hiring could shrink further, forcing the Fed to cut rates to prevent deeper economic damage.Source: New York TimesBusinesses Continue to Face Uncertainty After Latest U.S. Tariff Blitz, ICC SaysWhat Happened: The International Chamber of Commerce says companies worldwide remain in limbo after Trump\u2019s tariff hikes lacked critical details on implementation. With rates delayed until Aug. 7 and legal challenges pending, firms are pausing investments and hiring amid uncertainty over long-term trade barriers.Why It Matters: The confusion highlights chaotic policymaking that destabilizes global markets and erodes business confidence. Trump\u2019s erratic tariff regime threatens supply chains and long-term investment, with ripple effects on economies worldwide.Source: Wall Street JournalUS manufacturing extends slump; factory employment lowest in 5 yearsWhat Happened: U.S. manufacturing contracted for the fifth consecutive month in July, with the ISM index falling to 48.0. Factory employment dropped to its lowest level since 2020 as Trump\u2019s tariffs pushed up raw material costs and demand weakened.Why It Matters: The prolonged downturn signals worsening industrial decline and job losses across the sector. Tariff-driven inflation and uncertainty in global trade are straining manufacturers, undermining Trump\u2019s promises to \u201crevive\u201d American factory jobs.Source: ReutersTrump calls on the Federal Reserve board to take full control of the central bank from PowellWhat Happened: Trump demanded the Federal Reserve Board strip Chair Jerome Powell of authority after Powell refused to cut interest rates as \u201cordered.\u201d Trump, who has attacked Powell for months, is exploring ways to remove him early despite a Supreme Court ruling blocking dismissal over policy disputes.Why It Matters: Trump continues his direct assault on the Fed\u2019s independence, a pillar of U.S. economic stability. Politicizing monetary policy will destabilize markets, fuel inflation, and give Trump unprecedented control over central banking.Source: Associated PressTrump injects a new dose of uncertainty in tariffs as he pushes start date back to Aug. 7What Happened: Trump postponed tariffs on imports from 66 countries, the EU, and Taiwan to August 7, citing the need to update schedules. The delay follows chaotic trade talks and a legal challenge over whether Trump exceeded his authority by declaring an \u201cemergency\u201d to bypass Congress.Why It Matters: The move deepens market uncertainty and highlights instability in U.S. trade policy. With historically high tariffs looming, inflation risks and recession fears grow as Trump weaponizes economic policy.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501'Honk If You Hate Elon:' Two Days of Protest at the Tesla DinerWhat Happened: Protesters in LA gathered for two days outside Tesla\u2019s new diner, using Nazi-saluting Musk inflatables and chants to denounce his $250 million donation to Trump, white supremacist platforming on X, unauthorized DOGE-driven aid cuts, and attacks on democracy. Organizers vowed weekly protests until the diner closes.Source: 404 MediaJudge blocks Trump from ending protections for 60,000 from Central America and NepalWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s plan to strip Temporary Protected Status from 60,000 immigrants from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The court found Trump\u2019s actions racially motivated and lacking an objective review of conditions in these countries. The ruling keeps protections in place as the case moves forward.Source: Associated PressUS states sue over Trump's targeting of providers of transgender youth medical careWhat Happened: 16 Democratic-led states and Washington, DC, filed a federal lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive order directing DOJ prosecutors to investigate and defund providers of gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. The suit argues that Trump is using unrelated laws to intimidate doctors and unlawfully override states\u2019 rights to regulate medicine.Source: ReutersGavin Newsom may call special election to redraw California congressional mapsWhat Happened: California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he may call a November special election to let voters approve changes enabling Democrats to redraw congressional districts. The move comes as Texas Republicans advance a Trump-backed mid-decade redistricting plan to add five GOP seats and lock in House control.Source: The GuardianUS appeals court indicates it might declare Trump\u2019s birthright citizenship order unconstitutionalWhat Happened: A federal appeals court signaled it may declare Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional. Judges cited Supreme Court precedent guaranteeing citizenship to nearly all children born on U.S. soil, rejecting Trump\u2019s attempt to deny it to children of undocumented immigrants. A second appeals court has already ruled against the order, which will likely head to the Supreme Court.Source: The GuardianRepublican US Representative Brian Steil booed over Trump tariffsWhat Happened: Republican Rep. Brian Steil faced boos at a Wisconsin town hall after defending Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs on countries from India to Switzerland. Constituents slammed the policy as a \u201cterrible tax\u201d on Americans. Steil also fielded backlash over Gaza food shortages and Trump\u2019s mass deportations, but stuck to White House talking points.Source: ReutersThe Rough Day in Court for Trump\u2019s TariffsWhat Happened: A federal appeals court sharply questioned Trump\u2019s claim that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act allows him to bypass Congress and unilaterally rewrite U.S. tariff schedules. Judges noted the law has never been used for tariffs and expressed doubt that Congress intended to grant such sweeping power to the president.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers$200 million \u2014 Cash war chest now held by MAGA Inc., fueled by Musk, crypto donations, and corporate money.$174 million \u2014 Corporate and industry PAC contributions to lawmakers who tried to overturn the 2020 election.2.5 years \u2014 Length of delay in Sen.

I had no idea that a triple murderer was part of the Venezuelan prisoner exchange. He shouldn\u2019t have been included American or not. I know a woman from El Salvador    who is now a US citizen. Bukele is very popular with her and her country men and women because prior to his rise gangs had made it impossible to walk the streets in any safety. He\u2019s popular all through Central America. Apparently exchanging democracy for personal safety is a trade off many are willing to take. I\u2019d be interested on your thoughts Olga about this phenomenon. </span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full

The group, run by Trump insiders, spent $81 million during the election while keeping its donor list hidden.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is the first confirmed corporate donation to Trump\\u2019s dark money network, exposing how major tech firms are covertly bankrolling his political machine while shielding their involvement from public scrutiny.</p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/qualcomm-gave-1-million-to-pro-trump-dark-money-group/\\\\\\\">CREW</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Corporate America has largely abandoned its post-January 6 promises on democracy</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Despite pledges to cut ties after January 6, more than 2,000 corporate and industry PACs have funneled $174 million to lawmakers who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Major donors include Koch Industries, AT&amp;T, and American Crystal Sugar. Speaker Mike Johnson and other key conspirators have seen donations surge as they consolidate power.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Corporate America is bankrolling authoritarianism. Companies that vowed to uphold democracy are instead financing politicians who tried to overturn an election and were involved in an insurrection, fueling Trump\\u2019s autocratic agenda and corroding the rule of law that underpins free markets and political stability.</p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/corporate-america-has-largely-abandoned-its-post-january-6-promises-on-democracy/\\\\\\\">CREW</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Markwayne Mullin Violated the STOCK Act by Failing to Disclose Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars in Trades</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Sen.

The late filings, involving trades by Mullin and his wife, were attributed to \\u201Cdelayed amendments,\\u201D with his office stating that an outside firm manages his portfolio.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This violation underscores how lawmakers often circumvent transparency rules designed to prevent insider trading.

GM gave $1.54 million vs. $1 million reported, Amazon nearly $2 million vs. $1 million, Microsoft $1 million vs. $750K, and USAA also revealed discrepancies. Trump\\u2019s committee amended filings but blamed corporate \\u201Cdocumentation errors.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These underreported donations show how corporations can funnel millions into Trump\\u2019s political machine with no oversight.

This gives Trump a chance to appoint a new governor who could later be elevated to chair when Powell\\u2019s term ends in 2026.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has relentlessly attacked Powell for resisting rate cuts and wants to stack the Fed with loyalists.

The transfer came after a meeting with Trump\\u2019s Deputy AG Todd Blanche, where she reportedly \\u201Cnamed\\u201D 100 people tied to Epstein while seeking a pardon or reduced sentence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is extraordinary leniency for a convicted child sex trafficker.

Comer denied her requests for immunity and advance questions but kept the subpoena for a future deposition on Epstein\\u2019s non-prosecution deal and death.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The delay shields Trump while DOJ orchestrates a massive cover-up of Epstein\\u2019s network, stalling accountability and blocking a probe that could expose powerful allies.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5432918-maxwell-appeals-conviction-supreme-court/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>FBI Redacted Trump\\u2019s Name in Epstein Files for Privacy Reasons</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The FBI redacted Trump\\u2019s name and other high-profile figures from Jeffrey Epstein case files, citing privacy because they were private citizens when the probe began. Over 1,000 agents reviewed 100,000 documents, flagging any mention of Trump, but DOJ and FBI ultimately concluded \\u201Cno further disclosure\\u201D was warranted.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This sweeping redaction shields Trump and other elites from scrutiny, fueling claims of a coordinated DOJ cover-up to bury evidence on Epstein\\u2019s network and protect powerful allies.

While agencies were told to hold off fully ending agreements until litigation concludes, Trump is now free to execute the order at his discretion.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a major victory for Trump\\u2019s effort to purge and control the federal workforce.

The settlement followed the purge of top antitrust officials, internal disputes over merger enforcement, and reports of political lobbying tied to Trump.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The settlement, criticized for enabling harmful market consolidation, highlights growing political interference in antitrust enforcement.

Without evidence, he accused her of \\u201Crigging\\u201D data to hurt Republicans. McEntarfer, a Biden appointee with decades of service, was replaced by her deputy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump wants to mirror Russia\\u2019s practice of fabricating data to protect his power. By purging independent statisticians, he undermines trusted U.S. economic reporting, threatening markets, policymaking, and accountability.

The settlement requires Columbia to report minor offenses, including protest-related trespassing, to federal immigration authorities and take steps to reduce financial reliance on international students.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This sets a dangerous precedent for universities acting as immigration enforcers, threatening academic freedom and dissent while deterring foreign talent.

The freeze, affecting grants from multiple federal agencies, follows a DOJ finding that UCLA \\u201Cviolated\\u201D civil rights laws.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> UCLA is the latest target in Trump\\u2019s broader crackdown on higher education, using funding threats to dismantle diversity initiatives and reshape campus policies.
