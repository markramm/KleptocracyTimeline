REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/FileShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 2-4Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udea8 AnnouncementStarting this week, Zev Shalev and I are taking the Trump Tyranny Tracker to Substack LIVE \u2014 every Monday through Thursday at 2 PM ET.We\u2019ll break down the top stories the media isn\u2019t paying attention to \u2014 power grabs, agency purges, surveillance overreach, and the tactics being used to dismantle democracy. Please tune in and spread the word!\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsNASA Proposal Would Shift Agency\u2019s Focus Away From Space ScienceWhat Happened: Trump proposed a 24% cut to NASA\u2019s budget, slashing funding for Earth science, climate monitoring, and robotic missions while allocating $1 billion toward a Mars program aligned with Elon Musk\u2019s goals. Why It Matters: More corruption\u2014NASA is being hijacked to serve Musk\u2019s Mars obsession, while climate science and education get defunded. Trump is weaponizing the agency to serve a billionaire\u2019s agenda.Source: New York TimesTrump White-Collar Criminal Pardons Cost Public $1B, Says Ex-DoJ OfficialWhat Happened: Former Justice Department pardon attorney Liz Oyer revealed that Trump\u2019s recent pardons for white-collar criminals erased over $1 billion in court-ordered restitution owed to the public. Oyer, who was fired in March after refusing to restore Mel Gibson\u2019s gun rights, said the pardons include high-profile cases like Michele Fiore and Trevor Milton.Why It Matters: Trump is using the pardon power to cancel billion-dollar debts owed to victims and the public, shielding loyalists and elites from accountability. The rule of law is being rewritten for friends and donors.Source: The GuardianTrump Family's Net Worth Surges by $2.9 Billion from Crypto Ventures, Watchdog Warns of ConflictsWhat Happened: A new report finds that the Trump family's wealth has grown by nearly $3 billion in six months, largely from crypto ventures like $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins and their 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange launched during Trump's second term. The boost includes a $2B stablecoin deal with a UAE-backed firm.Why It Matters: The explosive growth comes as Trump dismantles crypto regulations and pardons convicted crypto executives, highlighting corruption, ethics violations, and self-dealing from the Oval Office.

He\u2019s reiterating that the law doesn\u2019t apply to him\u2014and that courts, rights, and legal limits are obstacles to be ignored, not respected. Dictators don\u2019t follow constitutions\u2014they rewrite them to serve their power.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Says Judges He Appoints Won't Demand Deportation 'Trials'What Happened: Trump said he is appointing judges who won\u2019t require trials for undocumented immigrants, claiming the judicial process is too slow and that mass deportation cannot wait.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on due process and the Constitution\u2014Trump wants to stack the courts with loyalists to bypass constitutional rights, eliminate hearings, and fast-track disappearances.

IRS lawyers have been called into weekend meetings to fast-track legal justifications. Trump has already threatened Harvard, and insiders say a broader crackdown is in motion.Why It Matters: Trump is preparing to weaponize the IRS to punish critics and silence civil society\u2014exactly what authoritarian regimes do. By targeting nonprofits and threatening their tax status, he\u2019s turning federal power into a tool of political retribution and setting a dangerous precedent for using the tax code to crush dissent.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Says He Is Revoking Harvard's Tax-Exempt StatusWhat Happened: Trump announced that he will strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status, escalating his campaign against elite institutions that reject his demands, including ending DEI programs and turning over data on international students.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s attack on Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status is blatant political retribution. It threatens academic freedom, punishes dissent, and weaponizes federal power to silence institutions that challenge his agenda\u2014an assault on the First Amendment.Source: CBS NewsTrump Says He Will Reopen Alcatraz PrisonWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to reopen and expand the infamous Alcatraz prison, stating it will be used to house \u201cAmerica\u2019s most ruthless and violent offenders,\u201d and declaring it a symbol of \u201cLaw, Order, and JUSTICE.\u201d The move follows his escalating efforts to bypass due process, including disappearing immigrants without trials and threats to send U.S. citizens to foreign prisons.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s move to revive Alcatraz is more than a symbolic gesture\u2014it\u2019s part of a broader push to normalize mass incarceration, eliminate legal protections, and create a parallel prison system for those he deems enemies.

This comes shortly after firing NSA chief Tim Haugh and signals tighter control by Trump and a shrinking circle of loyalists, including extremist influencer Laura Loomer.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting the national security system and replacing oversight with loyalty tests. By handing power to ideologues and far-right media extremists, he\u2019s turning U.S. foreign policy into a tool of personal revenge\u2014at a moment of escalating global instability.Source: Associated PressTrump to Cut Thousands of Jobs from CIA and Other Spy AgenciesWhat Happened: The Trump White House plans to cut over 1,200 CIA jobs and thousands more across the intelligence community, including the NSA, as part of a sweeping purge to realign national security with Trump\u2019s agenda. Why It Matters: These purges are part of a sweeping ideological effort to dismantle the professional intelligence apparatus, consolidate loyalty, and redirect U.S. spying efforts to align with Trump\u2019s political agenda. This will weaken U.S. capabilities and endanger U.S. national security amid rising global threats.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJustice Department Will Shift Voting Focus to Fraud, Prioritize Trump\u2019s Elections Order, Memo SaysWhat Happened: A leaked DOJ memo shows the Civil Rights Division is being repurposed to focus on \u201cvoter fraud\u201d and enforce Trump\u2019s executive order on elections\u2014dropping its core mission of protecting voting rights, ballot access, and fighting racial gerrymandering.Why It Matters: This is how democracy gets dismantled\u2014Trump is turning the Civil Rights Division into a voter suppression tool, abandoning its mandate to protect voting access and racial justice in favor of chasing Trump\u2019s fraud lies and enforcing political control over elections.Source: Associated PressThe Destruction of the Department of JusticeWhat Happened: Trump has turned the Department of Justice into a weapon of personal power\u2014launching sham investigations into critics like Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, ordering politically motivated probes into Democratic platforms, rewarding loyalists with pardons, and purging civil servants who follow the law. The DOJ is being used to shield allies, punish enemies, and enforce Trump\u2019s political agenda instead of the law.Why It Matters: The DOJ is no longer independent and is a corrupt enforcement arm. Justice is no longer about facts or fairness, just loyalty. This is authoritarianism in action, and if we don\u2019t push back, the rule of law may never recover.Source: The AtlanticIn Leak Crackdown, Bondi Rolls Back 2013 Protection Stemming From Fox News CaseWhat Happened: Pam Bondi quietly eliminated a safeguard that had prevented the Justice Department from portraying journalists as criminals to obtain search warrants for their records, reversing reforms implemented after a 2013 case involving Fox News\u2019 James Rosen.Why It Matters: This guts First Amendment protections for journalists\u2014paving the way for surveillance, intimidation, and prosecution of reporters who expose Trump\u2019s corruption or publish leaks he doesn\u2019t like. It\u2019s a direct attack on press freedom and a hallmark tactic of authoritarian regimes trying to silence dissent and dismantle accountability.Source: New York TimesCIA Fires Top Doctor Targeted by Far-Right ActivistWhat Happened: The C.I.A. dismissed Dr. Terry Adirim, its top medical official, after far-right extremists Ivan Raiklin and Laura Loomer targeted her for supporting the Pentagon\u2019s 2021 COVID vaccine mandate. Her firing came just one month before qualifying for full retirement benefits.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous escalation of Trump\u2019s political purge inside the intelligence community.

The parade would coincide with the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary, but has been expanded at Trump\u2019s request.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s military parade obsession is becoming reality\u2014costing tens of millions and turning D.C. into a stage for an authoritarian spectacle\u2014like in Russia and North Korea.

Attendees included Pizzagate promoter Jack Posobiec and meme propagandists like Rogan O\u2019Handley. Some guests praised the regime on camera, while others floated questions about Epstein files and investigating Obama.Why It Matters: The White House is replacing traditional media with a propaganda machine\u2014platforming conspiracy theorists and loyalists to shape public opinion, bypass scrutiny, and flood social media with curated talking points. This is state propaganda and media in the making.Source: NBC NewsTrump says he'll call CEOs when he disagrees with their business decisionsWhat Happened: In an interview, Trump said he\u2019ll \u201calways call\u201d CEOs if he disagrees with their business decisions, confirming a recent call to Jeff Bezos after Amazon considered listing tariff charges on its site. Trump claimed Bezos reversed course after their conversation and defended the tactic.Why It Matters: This is government overreach and happens in authoritarian countries. Trump is strong-arming private companies to hide the real cost of his tariffs from the public\u2014a blatant abuse of power aimed at silencing dissent, manipulating perception, and dodging accountability for his economic chaos.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump's Education Dept Guts Civil Rights Enforcement, Targets Trans StudentsWhat Happened: Trump gutted the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights\u2014shuttering offices, firing attorneys, and rerouting complaints to bypass legal experts. Investigations into racism and disability discrimination have been scrapped in favor of partisan attacks on trans students and diversity programs.Why It Matters: This is a full-blown assault on civil rights. Trump has turned the Office for Civil Rights into a weapon, dismissing thousands of discrimination cases while using what\u2019s left of it to target trans students and dismantle racial equity. Trump and the GOP continue their ideological warfare.Source: ProPublicaATF Takes Down Gun Violence Victim Memorial at HeadquartersWhat Happened: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives quietly removed its Faces of Gun Violence exhibit, which honored 120 victims of shootings, including mass shootings, suicides, and domestic violence. The Justice Department offered no clear reason, only stating it would now honor \u201call victims of violent crime.\u201dWhy It Matters: The memorial\u2019s removal is a cruel political statement erasing the faces of gun violence victims while Trump guts firearm regulations. It\u2019s a slap in the face to grieving families and a calculated move to bury the truth of America\u2019s gun crisis.Source: NPRVisa Crackdown Leads International Students in the US to Reconsider Summer TravelWhat Happened: Amid a Trump crackdown, over 4,700 international students have had their visa records terminated since March, many without clear cause, prompting colleges to issue travel warnings and students to cancel summer plans out of fear they won\u2019t be allowed back into the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration regime is turning legal status into a trap\u2014revoking student visas en masse, fueling fear and isolation, and signaling that lawful presence offers no protection. It\u2019s gutting U.S. universities and destroying America\u2019s standing as a global education leader.Source: Associated PressWoman in Florida Deported to Cuba Says She Was Forced to Leave Baby DaughterWhat Happened: Heidy S\u00e1nchez, a breastfeeding mother with a 17-month-old daughter who has health problems, was deported to Cuba after an ICE check-in in Tampa. She was forced to hand over her child to a lawyer while her U.S. citizen husband stood outside, unable to say goodbye.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is tearing apart families\u2014and separating U.S. citizen children from their parents. This case exposes the regime\u2019s disregard for due process, parental rights, and basic humanitarian standards in pursuit of mass deportations.Source: The GuardianTrump Slashes Research Into LGBTQ HealthWhat Happened: Trump canceled over $800 million in NIH-funded research focused on LGBTQ health, including critical studies on HIV, cancer, and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting sexual and gender minorities. Nearly half of all NIH grants terminated through early May were related to LGBTQ health.Why It Matters: These cuts represent a deliberate rollback of science-based public health in favor of right-wing ideology. Defunding LGBTQ health research amid rising STI rates risks worsening outcomes for millions and erasing decades of progress.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchThe Signal Clone Trump Officials Use Was HackedWhat Happened: TeleMessage, an Israeli company that sells cloned versions of Signal and other encrypted apps to U.S. agencies, was hacked, exposing sensitive group and direct messages from users, including Customs and Border Protection and Coinbase. The breach affected modified apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat, used for archiving government and corporate communications.Why It Matters: Trump officials are using a hacked, insecure Signal clone for cabinet-level communications, without true end-to-end encryption. This exposes U.S. government operations to espionage and cyber intrusion, highlighting catastrophic failures in data security and a reckless disregard for national intelligence protocols.Source: 404 MediaWaltz\u2019s Use of Messaging Platform Raises New Security QuestionsWhat Happened: A Reuters photo revealed Michael Waltz using a modified Signal-like app, TeleMessage, during a White House meeting to communicate with top Trump officials, including Rubio, Vance, and Gabbard, raising more alarms about the security and legality of encrypted backchannels used for sensitive military planning. Why It Matters: Waltz and Trump\u2019s cabinet continue using an unsecured app, even after the SignalGate scandal. It\u2019s reckless, lawless, and reiterates that they don\u2019t care about protecting U.S. secrets or preserving legally required records.Source: New York TimesFunds for K-12 Students Are on the Chopping Block in Trump\u2019s BudgetWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget proposes a $12 billion cut to the Department of Education, including $4.5 billion slashed from K-12 schools.Why It Matters: The sweeping cuts dismantle federal support for vulnerable students and essential educational services under the guise of \u201cstreamlining,\u201d advancing Trump\u2019s broader agenda to abolish the Department of Education and privatize public schooling.Source: New York TimesV.A.

PTSD and suicide care are breaking down, treatment is being cut short, and the regime is pushing ahead with mass purges. Veterans are paying the price for political cruelty.Source: New York TimesTrump Seeks to End Permanent Supportive Housing for the Chronically HomelessWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget proposal would eliminate funding for permanent supportive housing programs, redirecting money toward short-term shelters and limiting assistance to two years. More than 300,000 chronically homeless and disabled people\u2014many of them veterans\u2014currently rely on this long-term housing model.Why It Matters: This move would throw thousands of vulnerable Americans back onto the streets, gutting decades of bipartisan efforts to reduce chronic homelessness. It\u2019s a cruel policy that will worsen the crisis.Source: New York TimesMajor Delays at Newark Airport as FAA Cites Air Traffic Control Staffing IssuesWhat Happened: Newark Liberty International Airport faced over 200 delays and nearly 90 cancellations on Sunday due to severe FAA staffing shortages, with over 20% of controllers reportedly walking off the job. United Airlines slashed 35 daily flights.Why It Matters: Aviation safety is deteriorating as Trump guts the FAA amid rising flight incidents. With experts warning Newark is no longer safe to fly through, the crisis exposes the real-world consequences of political purges and underfunded infrastructure.Source: The GuardianCuts Have Eliminated More Than a Dozen U.S. Government Health-Tracking ProgramsWhat Happened: In the first 100 days, Trump has gutted over a dozen CDC and HHS programs that tracked vital health data, from abortion and pregnancy to lead poisoning, drug use, and job-related injuries, leaving states without critical tools for monitoring public health.Why It Matters: These cuts dismantle the nation\u2019s health surveillance infrastructure, silencing data that once exposed crises like maternal mortality, vaping in teens, and toxic exposures. Without data, there is no accountability.Source: Associated PressTrump Officials Gut 25 Centers That Monitor Flooding and Drought in the U.S.What Happened: Trump ordered the closure of 25 U.S. Geological Survey water science centers that provide critical data for flood warnings, drought declarations, and drinking water safety, affecting operations from Alaska to Massachusetts.Why It Matters: Shutting these centers guts the federal government\u2019s ability to respond to climate disasters. As floods, droughts, and toxic spills grow more frequent, slower alerts and weaker monitoring will cost lives, poison water, and leave American communities defenseless.Source: The GuardianMass Resignations at Labor Department Threaten Worker Protections as Trump Plans Deeper CutsWhat Happened: Nearly 2,700 employees\u2014about 20% of the Department of Labor\u2019s workforce\u2014have left in early 2025 amid mass buyouts and fears of Trump\u2019s looming purges. A simultaneous $577 million cut to international labor grants has gutted core functions like wage enforcement and anti-child labor programs.Why It Matters: Staff warn the department is nearing collapse, with fewer safety inspectors, legal protections, and labor rights enforcement. International programs targeting forced labor are being gutted, threatening U.S. trade compliance and global human rights.Source: The GuardianScientist Who Promoted Hydroxychloroquine Returns to HHS in Senior RoleWhat Happened: Steven Hatfill, a controversial virologist known for promoting hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic, has rejoined the federal government as a senior adviser at HHS. He will work in the Office of the Director at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, the agency responsible for coordinating national disaster and pandemic response.Why It Matters: Trump is reinstalling loyalists who undermined science during the pandemic. Putting him in charge of future biological threat planning is terrifying and politicizes public health at the expense of expertise.Source: Washington PostTrump Proposes Eliminating NEA and NEH as Arts Grants CanceledWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposes shutting down the National Endowment for the Arts and the Humanities, canceling hundreds of grants, and repurposing funds for \u201cpatriotic\u201d initiatives like the National Garden of American Heroes.Why It Matters: This marks Trump\u2019s most aggressive move yet to defund public arts and culture, targeting support for underserved communities and dismantling programs that promote diversity, education, and historical preservation.Source: Washington PostTrump education budget hits preschool funding, civil rights, but boosts charter schoolsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 2026 education budget proposes major cuts to preschool grants, adult learning programs, and the Office of Civil Rights, while increasing funding for charter schools by $60 million.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting civil rights, killing DEI, defunding federal oversight, and handing public education to private interests and partisan state officials. Working families will pay the price in lost protections, unequal access, and rising costs.Source: The HillEPA to Slash Staff to 1980s Levels, Eliminate Research OfficeWhat Happened: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a $300 million budget cut for FY2026, plans to slash staff to 1980s levels, and the dissolution of its independent Office of Research and Development, shifting scientific oversight to politically controlled offices aligned with Trump\u2019s agenda.Why It Matters: The move guts scientific independence at the EPA, replacing evidence-based research with political loyalty. It cripples the agency\u2019s ability to protect air, water, and public health\u2014and clears the path for polluters and deregulation.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Says He \u2018Doesn\u2019t Rule Out\u2019 Using Military Force to Control GreenlandWhat Happened: In an NBC interview, Trump, again, refused to rule out the use of U.S. military force to take control of Greenland, calling the territory vital for \u201cinternational security.\u201d Trump also reiterated interest in annexing Canada, though he called military action there \u201chighly unlikely.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump continues to threaten NATO unity and echoes imperialist ambitions reminiscent of Putin. Greenland is part of Denmark\u2014a key NATO ally\u2014and any military move would provoke an international crisis. The threat reinforces Trump\u2019s disregard for international law and democratic alliances.Source: The GuardianGermany Hits Back at Marco Rubio After He Panned Labeling of AfD as \u2018Extremist\u2019What Happened: After Marco Rubio criticized Germany for officially designating the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) as a confirmed rightwing extremist group, Germany\u2019s foreign ministry publicly defended the decision as democratic and grounded in constitutional law.Why It Matters: Instead of minding his own business, Rubio is meddling in Germany\u2019s politics\u2014siding with the far-right, pro-Russian AfD, a party with neo-Nazi ties and open hostility to democracy.

Consumers are already seeing higher costs, especially after the end of a loophole that exempted low-cost imports from China.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade war is fueling inflation, shrinking product options, and forcing companies to halt imports or relocate manufacturing\u2014moves many say are unfeasible.Source: New York TimesTrump Calls for 100% Tariff on Movies Made OverseasWhat Happened: Trump announced a 100% tariff on films produced outside the U.S., claiming foreign tax incentives are a \u201cnational security threat\u201d and amount to hostile propaganda. The move caught Hollywood off guard.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s 100% tariff on foreign films would cripple the global film industry, trigger retaliatory bans, and collapse international box office profits\u2014devastating an already struggling sector with no clear plan for enforcement.Source: Wall Street JournalTemu Halts Direct China Shipments as Trump Ends De Minimis LoopholeWhat Happened: Chinese retailer Temu halted direct shipments from China to U.S. shoppers after Trump ended the de minimis rule, which allowed duty-free imports under $800. Now, Temu sells only from U.S. warehouses, and China-based listings are marked out of stock.Why It Matters: This marks a broader disruption in U.S.-China trade and e-commerce, with consumers now facing significantly higher prices, reduced selection, and hidden inflation due to 130\u2013150% import surcharges.Source: CNBCPorts Brace for the Impact of Tariffs as Shipments from China Drop DrasticallyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs are triggering a sharp decline in shipping traffic to U.S. ports, with the Port of Long Beach expecting a 20% drop in volume by the second half of 2025. Importers are holding off orders amid uncertainty, causing economic ripples across the supply chain.Why It Matters: The tariff chaos is gutting U.S. ports, threatening thousands of jobs, and risking a supply chain meltdown. Without urgent clarity, stores could face back-to-school and holiday shortages and empty shelves\u2014echoing the worst disruptions of the COVID era.Source: NPRCorporate America Is Leaving More Jobs UnfilledWhat Happened: Amid economic uncertainty, tariffs, and a government hiring freeze, major U.S. employers are pausing or slowing hiring instead of executing mass layoffs. Companies like JetBlue, Polaris, and top universities are freezing new roles, while others warn they\u2019ll leave positions unfilled as costs rise and trade disruptions grow.Why It Matters: While April\u2019s job report showed 177,000 new positions, a sharp drop in hiring signals a cooling labor market.
