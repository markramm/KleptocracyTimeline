Alex Brandon / AP fileShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Jan 29, 2025Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Media launches FinTech services brand amid crypto boomWhat Happened: Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced the launch of a new financial services and FinTech brand, Truth.Fi, capitalizing on the ongoing crypto boom. The company's stock surged over 11% following the announcement, signaling strong investor interest.Why It Matters: This move marks Trump's deeper foray into the financial sector, raising concerns about monetization of his political influence and high-risk financial speculation. With his history of business failures and regulatory scrutiny, watchdogs warn that Truth.Fi could become a vehicle for financial manipulation, further entangling his media company with digital assets in a largely unregulated space. The rapid stock increase also raises red flags over pump-and-dump concerns and the broader risks of politicized financial platforms.Source: ReutersRepublicans Move to Gut Consumer Financial Protection BureauWhat Happened: Republicans are renewing efforts to weaken or dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014a watchdog agency created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate banks, credit card companies, and payday lenders. Led by Sen. Ted Cruz and other GOP lawmakers, the push includes defunding the agency and limiting its regulatory powers over Wall Street and financial institutions.Why It Matters: Eliminating or crippling the CFPB would strip away critical consumer protections, leaving Americans more vulnerable to financial scams, predatory lending, and unchecked corporate abuses. The move signals a major victory for the banking and financial lobby, which has long opposed oversight. It also fits into a broader Republican agenda of deregulation and weakening independent agencies.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump DOJ in Talks to Drop Bribery Case Against NYC Mayor Eric AdamsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ is reportedly in talks to drop the bribery case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. Adams, who pleaded not guilty, has recently cozied up to Trump, met with Trump in Florida to discuss a pardon, and  attended his inauguration while avoiding criticism. The timing\u2014amid a DOJ overhaul and before Trump\u2019s Manhattan U.S. Attorney is confirmed\u2014raises ethical concerns.Why It Matters: This move highlights political favoritism, as Adams\u2019 public overtures to Trump coincide with potential intervention in his criminal case. The DOJ\u2019s apparent willingness to shield political allies while pursuing Trump\u2019s enemies signals the trend toward weaponized justice. This will set a dangerous precedent, reinforcing warnings that Trump\u2019s DOJ intends to operate as a tool for political loyalty rather than impartial law enforcement.Source: PoliticoMeta Pays Trump $25M to Settle Lawsuit Over Account SuspensionWhat Happened: Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit brought by  Trump over his social media ban following the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The deal, which does not require Meta to admit wrongdoing, includes $22 million for Trump\u2019s presidential library fund. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since courted Trump\u2019s favor, adjusting content moderation policies to align with Trump, ending fact-checking programs, and elevating Republican figures within the company.Why It Matters: The settlement signals a dangerous shift in tech policy, with major platforms like Meta aligning themselves with Trump to secure regulatory protection and influence. With the rollback of fact-checking and anti-disinformation efforts, the deal highlights the growing fusion of corporate power and authoritarian governance, setting a dangerous precedent for tech giants bowing to political pressure.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDefense Secretary Creates Task Force to Purge DEI in MilitaryWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a new Pentagon task force to eliminate diversity-related considerations in military promotions and job assignments. The group is set to issue recommendations by June 1 on how to dismantle DEI policies across the Department of Defense.Why It Matters: The removal of DEI policies in military leadership undermines efforts to ensure a diverse and equitable armed forces, reversing decades of progress in representation. The purge aligns with Trump\u2019s broader efforts to reshape federal agencies into ideological strongholds while sidelining protections for minority groups.Source: The New York TimesElon Musk Allies Take Over OPM, Raising Fears of a Loyalty PurgeWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management is now filled with appointees linked to Elon Musk\u2019s companies, many with little government experience. Key figures include Amanda Scales, a former Musk employee, and ex-Tesla engineer Riccardo Biasini. The agency is pushing Trump\u2019s effort to purge federal workers, enforcing loyalty tests and urging employees to report colleagues involved in DEIA initiatives.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s takeover of OPM accelerates his push to politicize the federal workforce through mass firings, AI-driven monitoring, and ideological purges. Implementing Schedule F lets him replace career civil servants with loyalists, eroding institutional independence and civil service protections. The fusion of AI and political control raises fears of a tech-driven autocracy under Trump and Musk.Source: WIREDMusk affiliate in FBI director's office sparks fear of partisan interferenceWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX affiliate and former aides to Trump allies are now advising the FBI director, sparking fears of partisan interference. \u201cA person who has been affiliated with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and a former aide to one of the FBI\u2019s toughest congressional critics are working as advisers to the bureau\u2019s director,\u201d four current and former FBI officials told NBC News.\" One adviser, Tom Ferguson, worked for Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally and FBI critic, and another previously worked for SpaceX. The new advisers' roles remain unclear, but sources say they could be influencing internal policies and restructuring.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s planned politicization of the FBI will threaten the agency\u2019s independence, aligning it with Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape federal law enforcement to serve his agenda. This mirrors tactics in Russia, where security services are tools for power, suppressing opposition, and targeting political enemies. Also, the presence of Musk-affiliated personnel raises concerns about private sector influence over national security operations.Source: NBC News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDefense secretary revokes security detail and clearance for Trump critic Gen. Mark Milley, orders investigationWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revoked the security clearance and security detail of Gen. Mark Milley, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a move widely seen as political retribution. Hegseth also ordered an inspector general investigation into Milley\u2019s \"conduct\", which could lead to a review of his military rank. This follows Trump\u2019s long-standing accusations of treason against Milley and the removal of his Pentagon portrait just hours after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Milley had received a preemptive pardon from President Biden before leaving office, protecting him from criminal prosecution but not administrative actions.Why It Matters: This unprecedented move signals Trump\u2019s escalation of purges against officials who opposed him, especially military leaders. Milley\u2019s defiance of Trump\u2019s authoritarian tendencies during his first term made him a prime target for retribution. Trump\u2019s removal of security details for other former officials\u2014including John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2014further highlights an effort to strip protection from perceived enemies and punish them. These actions mirror tactics used in Russia to eliminate dissent and ensure absolute loyalty in agencies.Source: CNNJustice Department drops case against Trump\u2019s former co-defendants in classified documents investigationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Justice Department has dropped charges against his former co-defendants in the classified documents case, originally brought by former special counsel Jack Smith. The decision effectively ends legal proceedings against Trump\u2019s aides and allies implicated in the mishandling of classified materials.Why It Matters: This move highlights political interference in the justice system, as Trump is now shielding his former associates from accountability. The dismissal signals a broader effort to dismantle investigations into Trump-era corruption, reinforcing the perception that the DOJ is being weaponized to protect Trump and his inner circle.Source: CNNTrump Orders Migrant Detention at Guant\u00e1namo BayWhat Happened: Trump signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to prepare Guant\u00e1namo Bay\u2019s Migrant Operations Center to detain thousands of migrants they call \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d He claims the facility has \u201c30,000 beds\u201d for the \u201cworst criminal illegal aliens,\u201d though officials at the Pentagon were caught off guard and say there are no concrete plans for such an expansion. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the naval base a \u201cperfect spot\u201d for mass deportations, signaling full Pentagon cooperation with Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration agenda.Why It Matters: This directive expands the militarization of immigration enforcement, using a controversial offshore military facility, that held terrorists, to house migrants\u2014an authoritarian tactic that removes detainees from public scrutiny and legal protections. Guant\u00e1namo Bay has a long history of human rights abuses, and detaining migrants there raises serious concerns about indefinite detention, lack of due process, and potential expansion beyond non-citizens. The move reflects Trump\u2019s broader push to consolidate executive power over immigration, increase military involvement in domestic policies, and normalize indefinite detention under national security pretexts.Source: NBC NewsTrump: Fed failed to beat inflation, \u2018I will do it\u2019What Happened: Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for failing to curb inflation, vowing to take control by ramping up U.S. energy production, cutting regulations, and prioritizing manufacturing. Posting on Truth Social, Trump blamed the Fed\u2019s focus on DEI, climate policies, and banking regulations for economic struggles. While Powell confirmed he has not had contact with Trump, Trump\u2019s comments suggest he will continue targeting the Fed, potentially pressuring the central bank to align with his economic agenda or fire him.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed attacks on the Fed raise concerns about political interference in monetary policy, undermining the central bank\u2019s independence. The comments also set the stage for potential leadership changes at the Fed, with Trump likely seeking to install loyalists who align with his agenda.Source: PoliticoJustice Department Drops Criminal Charges Against Former GOP CongressmanWhat Happened: The Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against former Representative Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), who was accused of lying to federal agents about accepting illegal campaign donations from a Nigerian billionaire. Fortenberry\u2019s previous conviction was overturned on appeal due to jurisdictional issues, but prosecutors had refiled the case in Washington. The dismissal was praised by Trump, who called it a victory against the \u201cillegal weaponization of our justice system.\u201dWhy It Matters: This move shows that Trump\u2019s Justice Department is selectively dropping cases against political allies while ramping up to prosecute opponents aggressively. The decision aligns with Trump\u2019s broader efforts to reshape the DOJ, purge career prosecutors, and protect figures within his sphere from legal consequences. Source: PoliticoSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUSDA inspector general escorted out of her office after defying White HouseWhat Happened: Phyllis Fong, the longest-serving inspector general in U.S. history, was forcibly removed from the Department of Agriculture by security agents after she refused to comply with Trump\u2019s attempt to fire her. Fong, who had served 22 years in the role, argued that the White House did not follow proper protocols in her termination.Why It Matters: This escalation against independent oversight is part of Trump\u2019s broader purge of watchdogs who investigate fraud, waste, and abuse across federal agencies. The removal of Fong signals a dangerous shift in consolidating power, undermining government accountability and stripping agencies of independent oversight. Source: ReutersTrump Orders Crackdown on \u2018Indoctrination,\u2019 Campus Protests, and Expands School ChoiceWhat Happened: Trump signed three executive orders reshaping U.S. education policy, targeting K-12 curricula, campus protests, and expanding school choice. The orders ban federal funding for schools that teach \"gender ideology\" or \"critical race theory,\" reinstate the 1776 Commission to promote \"patriotic education,\" and authorize legal action against teachers supporting gender-affirming policies for students. Trump also directed federal agencies to investigate and prosecute pro-Palestinian student protesters, including deporting visa holders accused of antisemitic behavior. Additionally, Trump is redirecting federal funds to prioritize private and faith-based school options, signaling a push toward privatization and conservative education reforms.Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s authoritarian control over education, using federal funding as a weapon to impose conservative ideology while silencing dissent. The criminalization of educators, coupled with massive federal intervention in curriculum content, threatens academic freedom and free speech on college campuses. Targeting student protesters for deportation sets a dangerous precedent for suppressing political activism. Trump\u2019s push to privatize education could also gut public schools in favor of ideological indoctrination.Source: PoliticoTrump Signs Order Targeting Pro-Palestinian Student Protesters for DeportationWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to explore deporting pro-Palestinian activists, including student visa holders who participated in protests. The order directs agencies to identify legal mechanisms to remove foreign nationals accused of breaking the law during demonstrations. The Department of Justice has also been tasked with investigating pro-Hamas graffiti and campus intimidation. Why It Matters: This order weaponizes immigration laws to target political dissent and sets a dangerous precedent for using deportation as a tool to silence activists. While framed as an effort to \u201ccombat antisemitism,\u201d the policy explicitly singles out pro-Palestinian demonstrators, blurring the lines between protest and criminality. The directive aligns with Trump\u2019s broader anti-immigrant agenda, raising concerns about further crackdowns on free speech and political expression\u2014especially on college campuses. Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Administration Strips Venezuelans of Temporary Deportation ProtectionsWhat Happened: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) extension granted to Venezuelans by President Biden earlier this month. The move cuts off legal status and work authorization nearly one year earlier than expected, now set to expire in October 2025 instead of October 2026.Why It Matters: This decision will impact hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing political persecution and economic collapse, forcing many into undocumented status and making them vulnerable to deportation. It also aligns with Trump\u2019s escalating immigration crackdown, targeting TPS holders despite the worsening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.Source: NBC NewsPentagon Agency Pauses MLK Day and Other Cultural ObservancesWhat Happened: The Defense Intelligence Agency ordered an immediate pause on all cultural observances, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations, Pride Month, Black History Month, Holocaust Remembrance, and Juneteenth. The move follows a broader Trump directive to eliminate DEI programs across federal agencies.Why It Matters: This directive signals an aggressive effort to erase recognition of marginalized communities within federal institutions, reinforcing the administration\u2019s broader crackdown on DEI initiatives. By targeting events that commemorate civil rights and historical injustices, Trump\u2019s Pentagon is further entrenching a revisionist, nationalist ideology that suppresses diversity and inclusion in government.Source: The New York TimesTrump Orders Agencies to Purge \u2018Gender Ideology\u2019 from GovernmentWhat Happened: Trump ordered federal agencies to eliminate all mentions of \u201cgender ideology\u201d from contracts, job descriptions, websites, and social media. Agencies must place employees promoting gender policies on leave and redesignate facilities based on \u201cbiological sex.\u201d Trump also cut federal funding for transgender healthcare and canceled $1 billion in DEIA-related contracts.Why It Matters: This move erases LGBTQ+ protections, targets federal workers, and enforces ideological conformity through executive power. It marks a sweeping rollback of civil rights, forcing compliance through fear and aligning with authoritarian governance tactics.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf1f Resilience and ResistanceWhat Happened: A second federal judge, U.S. District Judge John McConnell, signaled his intent to block Trump\u2019s sweeping federal spending freeze, citing contradictory White House statements that suggest the freeze remains in effect despite official claims of rescission. This follows a prior ruling from another judge, Loren AliKhan, who temporarily halted the freeze after lawsuits from nonprofits and Democratic attorneys general. The White House attempted to undercut these challenges by withdrawing the original memo ordering the freeze, but statements from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt implied the policy was still being enforced.Source: Politico\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers600,000 \u2013 Venezuelans who will lose Temporary Protected Status (TPS) protections under Trump\u2019s latest immigration order.$25 million \u2013 Amount Meta is paying Trump to settle his lawsuit over his account suspension.30,000 \u2013 Beds Trump claims are available at Guant\u00e1namo Bay for migrant detention.85 \u2013 Number of DEI-related contracts terminated across federal agencies.11% \u2013 The stock surge of Trump Media following the announcement of its new FinTech venture, Truth.Fi.1 \u2013 Judge preparing to block Trump\u2019s spending freeze despite White House attempts to walk it back.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump\u2019s Spending Freeze Showdown \u2013 Federal judges continue to challenge Trump\u2019s move to halt federal funding.

The company's stock surged over 11% following the announcement, signaling strong investor interest.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>This move marks Trump's deeper foray into the financial sector, raising concerns about monetization of his political influence and high-risk financial speculation. With his history of business failures and regulatory scrutiny, watchdogs warn that Truth.Fi could become a vehicle for financial manipulation, further entangling his media company with digital assets in a largely unregulated space. The rapid stock increase also raises red flags over pump-and-dump concerns and the broader risks of politicized financial platforms.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-media-launches-fintech-services-brand-2025-01-29/\" rel=\"\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>Republicans Move to Gut Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7republicans-move-to-gut-consumer-financial-protection-bureau\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/156064620/republicans-move-to-gut-consumer-financial-protection-bureau\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong><span>Republicans are renewing efforts to weaken or dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014a watchdog agency created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate banks, credit card companies, and payday lenders. Led by Sen. Ted Cruz and other GOP lawmakers, the push includes defunding the agency and limiting its regulatory powers over Wall Street and financial institutions.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>Eliminating or crippling the CFPB would strip away critical consumer protections, leaving Americans more vulnerable to financial scams, predatory lending, and unchecked corporate abuses. The move signals a major victory for the banking and financial lobby, which has long opposed oversight.

Adams, who pleaded not guilty, has recently cozied up to Trump, met with Trump in Florida to discuss a pardon, and  attended his inauguration while avoiding criticism. The timing\u2014amid a DOJ overhaul and before Trump\u2019s Manhattan U.S. Attorney is confirmed\u2014raises ethical concerns.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong><span>This move highlights political favoritism, as Adams\u2019 public overtures to Trump coincide with potential intervention in his criminal case. The DOJ\u2019s apparent willingness to shield political allies while pursuing Trump\u2019s enemies signals the trend toward weaponized justice. This will set a dangerous precedent, reinforcing warnings that Trump\u2019s DOJ intends to operate as a tool for political loyalty rather than impartial law enforcement.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.politico.com\" rel=\"\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h4 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>Meta Pays Trump $25M to Settle Lawsuit Over Account Suspension</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7meta-pays-trump-m-to-settle-lawsuit-over-account-suspension\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/156064620/meta-pays-trump-m-to-settle-lawsuit-over-account-suspension\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit brought by  Trump over his social media ban following the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The deal, which does not require Meta to admit wrongdoing, includes $22 million for Trump\u2019s presidential library fund. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since courted Trump\u2019s favor, adjusting content moderation policies to align with Trump, ending fact-checking programs, and elevating Republican figures within the company.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> The settlement signals a dangerous shift in tech policy, with major platforms like Meta aligning themselves with Trump to secure regulatory protection and influence.

The orders ban federal funding for schools that teach \"gender ideology\" or \"critical race theory,\" reinstate the 1776 Commission to promote </span><strong>\"patriotic education,\"</strong><span> and authorize legal action against teachers supporting gender-affirming policies for students. Trump also directed federal agencies to investigate and prosecute pro-Palestinian student protesters, including deporting visa holders accused of antisemitic behavior.

The company's stock surged over 11% following the announcement, signaling strong investor interest.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move marks Trump's deeper foray into the financial sector, raising concerns about monetization of his political influence and high-risk financial speculation. With his history of business failures and regulatory scrutiny, watchdogs warn that Truth.Fi could become a vehicle for financial manipulation, further entangling his media company with digital assets in a largely unregulated space. The rapid stock increase also raises red flags over pump-and-dump concerns and the broader risks of politicized financial platforms.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-media-launches-fintech-services-brand-2025-01-29/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Republicans Move to Gut Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Republicans are renewing efforts to weaken or dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\\u2014a watchdog agency created after the 2008 financial crisis to regulate banks, credit card companies, and payday lenders. Led by Sen. Ted Cruz and other GOP lawmakers, the push includes defunding the agency and limiting its regulatory powers over Wall Street and financial institutions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Eliminating or crippling the CFPB would strip away critical consumer protections, leaving Americans more vulnerable to financial scams, predatory lending, and unchecked corporate abuses. The move signals a major victory for the banking and financial lobby, which has long opposed oversight. It also fits into a broader Republican agenda of deregulation and weakening independent agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cfpb-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-ted-cruz-gop-defund-b831384c?st=2kPdW3&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump DOJ in Talks to Drop Bribery Case Against NYC Mayor Eric Adams</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump\\u2019s DOJ is reportedly in talks to drop the bribery case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. Adams, who pleaded not guilty, has recently cozied up to Trump, met with Trump in Florida to discuss a pardon, and  attended his inauguration while avoiding criticism. The timing\\u2014amid a DOJ overhaul and before Trump\\u2019s Manhattan U.S. Attorney is confirmed\\u2014raises ethical concerns.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move highlights political favoritism, as Adams\\u2019 public overtures to Trump coincide with potential intervention in his criminal case. The DOJ\\u2019s apparent willingness to shield political allies while pursuing Trump\\u2019s enemies signals the trend toward weaponized justice. This will set a dangerous precedent, reinforcing warnings that Trump\\u2019s DOJ intends to operate as a tool for political loyalty rather than impartial law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Meta Pays Trump $25M to Settle Lawsuit Over Account Suspension</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit brought by  Trump over his social media ban following the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. The deal, which does not require Meta to admit wrongdoing, includes $22 million for Trump\\u2019s presidential library fund. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since courted Trump\\u2019s favor, adjusting content moderation policies to align with Trump, ending fact-checking programs, and elevating Republican figures within the company.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The settlement signals a dangerous shift in tech policy, with major platforms like Meta aligning themselves with Trump to secure regulatory protection and influence. With the rollback of fact-checking and anti-disinformation efforts, the deal highlights the growing fusion of corporate power and authoritarian governance, setting a dangerous precedent for tech giants bowing to political pressure.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-agrees-pay-25-million-settle-trump-lawsuit-rcna189918\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h4><strong>Defense Secretary Creates Task Force to Purge DEI in Military</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a new Pentagon task force to eliminate diversity-related considerations in military promotions and job assignments. The group is set to issue recommendations by June 1 on how to dismantle DEI policies across the Department of Defense.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The removal of DEI policies in military leadership undermines efforts to ensure a diverse and equitable armed forces, reversing decades of progress in representation. The purge aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader efforts to reshape federal agencies into ideological strongholds while sidelining protections for minority groups.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/trump-federal-freeze-funding-news#trump-holiday-mlk-black-history-dei\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Elon Musk Allies Take Over OPM, Raising Fears of a Loyalty Purge</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Office of Personnel Management is now filled with appointees linked to Elon Musk\\u2019s companies, many with little government experience. Key figures include Amanda Scales, a former Musk employee, and ex-Tesla engineer Riccardo Biasini. The agency is pushing Trump\\u2019s effort to purge federal workers, enforcing loyalty tests and urging employees to report colleagues involved in DEIA initiatives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s takeover of OPM accelerates his push to politicize the federal workforce through mass firings, AI-driven monitoring, and ideological purges. Implementing Schedule F lets him replace career civil servants with loyalists, eroding institutional independence and civil service protections. The fusion of AI and political control raises fears of a tech-driven autocracy under Trump and Musk.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lackeys-office-personnel-management-opm-neuralink-x-boring-stalin/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Musk affiliate in FBI director's office sparks fear of partisan interference</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX affiliate and former aides to Trump allies are now advising the FBI director, sparking fears of partisan interference. \\u201CA person who has been affiliated with Elon Musk\\u2019s SpaceX and a former aide to one of the FBI\\u2019s toughest congressional critics are working as advisers to the bureau\\u2019s director,\\u201D four current and former FBI officials told NBC News.\\\\\\\" One adviser, Tom Ferguson, worked for Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally and FBI critic, and another previously worked for SpaceX. The new advisers' roles remain unclear, but sources say they could be influencing internal policies and restructuring.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s planned politicization of the FBI will threaten the agency\\u2019s independence, aligning it with Trump\\u2019s efforts to reshape federal law enforcement to serve his agenda. This mirrors tactics in Russia, where security services are tools for power, suppressing opposition, and targeting political enemies. Also, the presence of Musk-affiliated personnel raises concerns about private sector influence over national security operations.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/people-ties-musk-top-fbi-critic-are-advising-fbi-director-rcna189567\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Defense secretary revokes security detail and clearance for Trump critic Gen. Mark Milley, orders investigation</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revoked the security clearance and security detail of Gen. Mark Milley, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a move widely seen as political retribution. Hegseth also ordered an inspector general investigation into Milley\\u2019s \\\\\\\"conduct\\\\\\\", which could lead to a review of his military rank. This follows Trump\\u2019s long-standing accusations of treason against Milley and the removal of his Pentagon portrait just hours after Trump\\u2019s inauguration. Milley had received a preemptive pardon from President Biden before leaving office, protecting him from criminal prosecution but not administrative actions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This unprecedented move signals Trump\\u2019s escalation of purges against officials who opposed him, especially military leaders. Milley\\u2019s defiance of Trump\\u2019s authoritarian tendencies during his first term made him a prime target for retribution. Trump\\u2019s removal of security details for other former officials\\u2014including John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and Dr. Anthony Fauci\\u2014further highlights an effort to strip protection from perceived enemies and punish them. These actions mirror tactics used in Russia to eliminate dissent and ensure absolute loyalty in agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/classified-documents-dropped-trump-codefendants?cid=ios_app\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Justice Department drops case against Trump\\u2019s former co-defendants in classified documents investigation</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump\\u2019s Justice Department has dropped<strong> </strong>charges against his former co-defendants in the classified documents case, originally brought by former special counsel Jack Smith. The decision effectively ends legal proceedings against Trump\\u2019s aides and allies implicated in the mishandling of classified materials.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move highlights political interference in the justice system, as Trump is now shielding his former associates from accountability. The dismissal signals a broader effort to dismantle investigations into Trump-era corruption, reinforcing the perception that the DOJ is being weaponized to protect Trump and his inner circle.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/classified-documents-dropped-trump-codefendants?cid=ios_app\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Orders Migrant Detention at Guant\\u00E1namo Bay</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed a memo directing the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to prepare Guant\\u00E1namo Bay\\u2019s Migrant Operations Center to detain thousands of migrants they call \\u201Ccriminal aliens.\\u201D He claims the facility has \\u201C30,000 beds\\u201D for the \\u201Cworst criminal illegal aliens,\\u201D though officials at the Pentagon were caught off guard and say there are no concrete plans for such an expansion. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the naval base a \\u201Cperfect spot\\u201D for mass deportations, signaling full Pentagon cooperation with Trump\\u2019s aggressive immigration agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This directive expands the militarization of immigration enforcement, using a controversial offshore military facility, that held terrorists, to house migrants\\u2014an authoritarian tactic that removes detainees from public scrutiny and legal protections. Guant\\u00E1namo Bay has a long history of human rights abuses, and detaining migrants there raises serious concerns about indefinite detention, lack of due process, and potential expansion beyond non-citizens. The move reflects Trump\\u2019s broader push to consolidate executive power over immigration, increase military involvement in domestic policies, and normalize indefinite detention under national security pretexts.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-sign-order-housing-migrants-guantanamo-bay-rcna189884\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump: Fed failed to beat inflation, \\u2018I will do it\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for failing to curb inflation, vowing to take control by ramping up U.S. energy production, cutting regulations, and prioritizing manufacturing. Posting on Truth Social, Trump blamed the Fed\\u2019s focus on DEI, climate policies, and banking regulations for economic struggles. While Powell confirmed he has not had contact with Trump, Trump\\u2019s comments suggest he will continue targeting the Fed, potentially pressuring the central bank to align with his economic agenda or fire him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s renewed attacks on the Fed raise concerns about political interference in monetary policy, undermining the central bank\\u2019s independence. The comments also set the stage for potential leadership changes at the Fed, with Trump likely seeking to install loyalists who align with his agenda.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/trump-fed-failed-inflation-00201382\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Justice Department Drops Criminal Charges Against Former GOP Congressman</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department moved to dismiss criminal charges against former Representative Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), who was accused of lying to federal agents about accepting illegal campaign donations from a Nigerian billionaire. Fortenberry\\u2019s previous conviction was overturned on appeal due to jurisdictional issues, but prosecutors had refiled the case in Washington. The dismissal was praised by Trump, who called it a victory against the \\u201Cillegal weaponization of our justice system.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move shows that Trump\\u2019s Justice Department is selectively dropping cases against political allies while ramping up to prosecute opponents aggressively. The decision aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader efforts to reshape the DOJ, purge career prosecutors, and protect figures within his sphere from legal consequences. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/jeff-fortenberry-dismiss-charges-00201274\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>USDA inspector general escorted out of her office after defying White House</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Phyllis Fong, the longest-serving inspector general in U.S. history, was forcibly removed from the Department of Agriculture by security agents after she refused to comply with Trump\\u2019s attempt to fire her. Fong, who had served 22 years in the role, argued that the White House did not follow proper protocols in her termination.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This escalation against independent oversight is part of Trump\\u2019s broader purge of watchdogs who investigate fraud, waste, and abuse across federal agencies. The removal of Fong signals a dangerous shift in consolidating power, undermining government accountability and stripping agencies of independent oversight. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/usda-inspector-general-escorted-out-her-office-after-defying-white-house-2025-01-29/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Orders Crackdown on \\u2018Indoctrination,\\u2019 Campus Protests, and Expands School Choice</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump signed three executive orders reshaping U.S. education policy, targeting K-12 curricula, campus protests, and expanding school choice. The orders ban federal funding for schools that teach \\\\\\\"gender ideology\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"critical race theory,\\\\\\\" reinstate the 1776 Commission to promote <strong>\\\\\\\"patriotic education,\\\\\\\"</strong> and authorize legal action against teachers supporting gender-affirming policies for students. Trump also directed federal agencies to investigate and prosecute pro-Palestinian student protesters, including deporting visa holders accused of antisemitic behavior. Additionally, Trump is redirecting federal funds to prioritize private and faith-based school options, signaling a push toward privatization and conservative education reforms.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This escalates Trump\\u2019s authoritarian control over education, using federal funding as a weapon to impose conservative ideology while silencing dissent. The criminalization of educators, coupled with massive federal intervention in curriculum content, threatens academic freedom and free speech on college campuses. Targeting student protesters for deportation sets a dangerous precedent for suppressing political activism. Trump\\u2019s push to privatize education could also gut public schools in favor of ideological indoctrination.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/trump-k12-indoctrination-school-choice-campus-protests-education-00201235\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Signs Order Targeting Pro-Palestinian Student Protesters for Deportation</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to explore deporting pro-Palestinian activists, including student visa holders who participated in protests. The order directs agencies to identify legal mechanisms to remove foreign nationals accused of breaking the law during demonstrations. The Department of Justice has also been tasked with investigating pro-Hamas graffiti and campus intimidation. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This order weaponizes immigration laws to target political dissent and sets a dangerous precedent for using deportation as a tool to silence activists. While framed as an effort to \\u201Ccombat antisemitism,\\u201D the policy explicitly singles out pro-Palestinian demonstrators, blurring the lines between protest and criminality. The directive aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader anti-immigrant agenda, raising concerns about further crackdowns on free speech and political expression\\u2014especially on college campuses. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Administration Strips Venezuelans of Temporary Deportation Protections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) extension granted to Venezuelans by President Biden earlier this month. The move cuts off legal status and work authorization nearly one year earlier than expected, now set to expire in October 2025 instead of October 2026.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This decision will impact hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing political persecution and economic collapse, forcing many into undocumented status and making them vulnerable to deportation. It also aligns with Trump\\u2019s escalating immigration crackdown, targeting TPS holders despite the worsening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/tps-canceled-venezuelans-trump-noem-rcna189840\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Pentagon Agency Pauses MLK Day and Other Cultural Observances</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Defense Intelligence Agency ordered an immediate pause on all cultural observances, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations, Pride Month, Black History Month, Holocaust Remembrance, and Juneteenth. The move follows a broader Trump directive to eliminate DEI programs across federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This directive signals an aggressive effort to erase recognition of marginalized communities within federal institutions, reinforcing the administration\\u2019s broader crackdown on DEI initiatives. By targeting events that commemorate civil rights and historical injustices, Trump\\u2019s Pentagon is further entrenching a revisionist, nationalist ideology that suppresses diversity and inclusion in government.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/01/29/us/trump-federal-freeze-funding-news#trump-holiday-mlk-black-history-dei\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Trump Orders Agencies to Purge \\u2018Gender Ideology\\u2019 from Government</strong></h4><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered federal agencies to eliminate all mentions of \\u201Cgender ideology\\u201D from contracts, job descriptions, websites, and social media. Agencies must place employees promoting gender policies on leave and redesignate facilities based on \\u201Cbiological sex.\\u201D Trump also cut federal funding for transgender healthcare and canceled $1 billion in DEIA-related contracts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move erases LGBTQ+ protections, targets federal workers, and enforces ideological conformity through executive power. It marks a sweeping rollback of civil rights, forcing compliance through fear and aligning with authoritarian governance tactics.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-orders-agencies-scrub-gender-ideology-contracts-websites-2025-01-30/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83C\\uDF1F Resilience and Resistance</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>A second federal judge, U.S. District Judge John McConnell, signaled his intent to block Trump\\u2019s sweeping federal spending freeze, citing contradictory White House statements that suggest the freeze remains in effect despite official claims of rescission. This follows a prior ruling from another judge, Loren AliKhan, who temporarily halted the freeze after lawsuits from nonprofits and Democratic attorneys general.
