Critics warn the plan could disenfranchise eligible voters ahead of fall elections.Why It Matters: This is voter suppression disguised as \u201crepair.\u201d With Trump allies tightening election rules in a key swing state, civil rights groups fear a purge of valid voters under the guise of compliance\u2014just as municipal races begin.Source: Associated PressInterior Secretary Burgum must personally approve all wind and solar projects, a new order saysWhat Happened: A new order requires Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on federal lands and waters. The move adds red tape to clean energy development while fast-tracking fossil fuels under Trump\u2019s July 4 tax and energy law.Why It Matters: Trump is sabotaging clean energy at a critical moment\u2014slowing approvals, driving up energy costs, and steering national policy back toward fossil fuels just as demand and climate urgency grow.Source: Associated PressIn the Trump Administration, Watchdogs Are Watching Their BacksWhat Happened: Trump has fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general since January, crippling government oversight and replacing independent watchdogs with loyalists. Staff say they fear retribution for investigating Trump policies, with morale and output at historic lows.Why It Matters: Trump continues dismantling the system of internal checks meant to protect taxpayer money and uphold accountability. By turning watchdogs into political tools, he\u2019s gutting democratic safeguards and shielding corruption from scrutiny.Source: New York TimesRuss Vought: Appropriations Process \u2018Has to Be Less Bipartisan\u2019What Happened: OMB Director Russ Vought said that Trump will not honor bipartisan spending deals and plans more partisan rescissions packages. He dismissed the need for Democratic input and called the Impoundment Control Act unconstitutional.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to bypass Congress on spending shreds a foundational check on executive power. Vought\u2019s remarks make clear the goal: concentrate control in the White House and weaponize the budget process for political leverage.Source: PoliticoTrump effort to build food aid recipient database is unlawful privacy violation, lawmakers sayWhat Happened: Lawmakers condemned Trump\u2019s plan to compile a national database of food aid recipients, including Social Security numbers and immigration status, calling it an unlawful invasion of privacy. ICE will reportedly gain access to this data.Why It Matters: This is more surveillance disguised as policy. Trump is turning hunger relief into an immigration dragnet, weaponizing social programs to track and punish vulnerable Americans\u2014chilling access to basic aid and setting a precedent for broader data use.Source: ReutersTrump's DOJ contacted states for voter data, access to voting machines: SourcesWhat Happened: The Department of Justice has contacted at least 6 states requesting voter rolls, details on election systems, and access to voting machines. In Colorado, officials say a former Boebert aide claimed to act on behalf of the White House to target Republican clerks in blue states.Why It Matters: This is election interference from the inside and a threat to election integrity. Trump\u2019s DOJ is trying to breach voting systems and collect sensitive data\u2014reviving Trump\u2019s election LIES to rig future outcomes. Source: ABC NewsWhite House Seeks to Inspect Fed Renovation in Bid to Pressure PowellWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget chief Russell Vought is demanding access to the Federal Reserve building, claiming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u201cmismanaged\u201d its $2.5 billion renovation. Trump is using the project to push Powell to resign or cut rates.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated pressure campaign. Trump is trying to intimidate an independent agency to manipulate interest rates for his political agenda. Undermining the Fed\u2019s autonomy is a serious threat to the economy and democratic governance\u2014and manufacturing crimes to justify it is exactly how authoritarian regimes like Russia operate.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsInside ICE\u2019s Supercharged Facial Recognition App of 200 Million ImagesWhat Happened: ICE\u2019s new app, Mobile Fortify, lets agents scan a person\u2019s face and instantly pull data from over 200 million images tied to DHS, State, CBP, FBI, and state records\u2014returning names, nationalities, deportation orders, and more.Why It Matters: This is a dystopian leap in surveillance power. ICE can now extract personal data on demand just by pointing a phone, stripping away due process and creating new risks of abuse, misidentification, and racial profiling.Source: 404 MediaHouse NDAA would deepen Pentagon involvement in domestic, border operationsWhat Happened: The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act would formalize Pentagon involvement in border enforcement and domestic policing, authorizing military funding for surveillance, migrant detention, and law enforcement support under counterterrorism or anti-crime mandates.Why It Matters: This dangerously blurs the line between military and civilian power. It paves the way for a permanent military role in domestic affairs\u2014just as Trump leans on the Pentagon to enforce his immigration agenda and suppress dissent. We are witnessing the creation of a police state.Source: Defense OneMaurene Comey\u2019s Farewell After Firing: \u2018Fear Is the Tool of a Tyrant\u2019What Happened: Maurene Comey, a senior SDNY prosecutor and daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was fired without explanation after Trump privately objected to her continued role in the DOJ. In her farewell message, she urged colleagues not to give in to fear.Why It Matters: Comey\u2019s firing is more political retaliation\u2014punishing someone for their name, not misconduct. It\u2019s a warning shot to prosecutors that independence and integrity will get you fired.Source: ABC NewsJustice Dept. Seeks 1-Day Sentence for Ex-Officer in Breonna Taylor RaidWhat Happened: The Justice Department is requesting just one day in prison for Brett Hankison, the ex-officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor\u2019s civil rights in the 2020 raid where she was murdered. The ask came from a Trump appointee, overriding civil rights precedent and outraging Taylor\u2019s family.Why It Matters: This is a slap in the face to justice. One of the decade\u2019s most infamous police killings is being treated as a minor offense\u2014reiterating that under Trump, civil rights abuses by law enforcement will be excused.Source: New York TimesTrump administration hands over Medicaid recipients\u2019 personal data, including addresses, to ICEWhat Happened: Trump signed a secret agreement allowing ICE to access personal data\u2014including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and ethnicities\u2014of all Medicaid recipients to locate and deport undocumented immigrants. The data sharing affects 79 million enrollees.Why It Matters: This is a massive breach of medical privacy and a weaponization of health care systems to fuel Trump\u2019s deportation machine. It will deter millions from seeking lifesaving care\u2014and the use of this data will only expand as surveillance deepens.Source: Associated PressTrump Pulls $4 Billion from California High-Speed Rail ProjectWhat Happened: Trump canceled $4 billion in funding for California\u2019s high-speed rail, accusing the state of \u201cmismanagement and contract breaches.\u201d Gov. Newsom called the move illegal and vowed to fight it.Why It Matters: This guts one of the largest green infrastructure projects in the country, threatening union jobs, transit innovation, and climate goals. It also signals Trump\u2019s broader war on blue states and public infrastructure, using federal power to punish political enemies.Source: CNBCUS launches employment discrimination probe into Virginia's George Mason UniversityWhat Happened: The Justice Department launched a civil rights probe into George Mason University, accusing the school of using race and sex as factors in faculty hiring. It\u2019s the latest Trump crackdown on universities.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing civil rights law to kill diversity programs and silence universities. It\u2019s a cynical move that twists anti-discrimination statutes to punish schools for trying to be inclusive\u2014and turns equal protection into a tool of repression.Source: ReutersSenate committee advances Emil Bove's judicial nomination as meeting erupts in chaosWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s former defense lawyer Emil Bove cleared a key Senate hurdle for a lifetime judicial seat, with Republicans advancing his nomination 12-0 after Democrats walked out in protest. The hearing erupted over whistleblower claims and alleged unethical conduct tied to Bove\u2019s DOJ role.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s nomination\u2014despite serious misconduct allegations and telling prosecutors to ignore court orders\u2014marks another step in reshaping the judiciary, stacking the courts with loyalists to entrench Trump\u2019s power and erode judicial independence.Source: CBS NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsJudge tosses lawsuit seeking to shield names of FBI agents on Capitol riot probeWhat Happened: A federal judge tossed lawsuits from FBI agents seeking to block Trump from releasing their names in the January 6 investigation, calling the threat of disclosure too speculative.Why It Matters: Trump and his cronies want revenge\u2014and by demanding agent lists, the regime is signaling a purge of those who held insurrectionists accountable. The court\u2019s ruling exposes these agents to retaliation in a justice system now weaponized from the top down.Source: ReutersThe Enshittification of American PowerWhat Happened: Under Trump\u2019s second term, U.S. dominance in military, financial, and digital infrastructure is being used to pressure allies\u2014threatening to cut Starlink in Ukraine unless mineral rights are handed over, and leveraging dollar clearing and cloud access to punish foreign officials.Why It Matters: Trump is turning American platforms into weapons of coercion. Allies are trapped in systems they can\u2019t escape, as U.S. power shifts from stabilizing force to extraction tool\u2014merging monopoly control with state dominance in an attempt to collapse global order.Source: WIRED\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsFlight Manifests Reveal Dozens of Previously Unknown People on Three Deportation Flights to El SalvadorWhat Happened: Hacked flight manifests show dozens of people disappeared by the Trump regime to a Salvadoran gulag despite a court order blocking the flights. These individuals were never acknowledged by DHS and remain unaccounted for.Why It Matters: The U.S. government is disappearing people. With no due process or public records. It\u2019s a terrifying escalation of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine and a clear violation of human rights.Source: 404 MediaAttorneys sue to restore deportation protections for abused and neglected migrant childrenWhat Happened: A new lawsuit challenges Trump\u2019s decision to revoke deportation protections for migrant children with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status\u2014minors who were abused, abandoned, or neglected. Why It Matters: This is cruelty codified. Vulnerable kids fleeing trauma are being retraumatized and stripped of legal protections. It\u2019s a quiet but devastating and heartless front in Trump\u2019s broader war on immigration.Source: ABC NewsUrban League declares a \u2018state of emergency\u2019 for civil rights in the US in response to TrumpWhat Happened: The National Urban League declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d over civil rights, accusing Trump of dismantling protections, gutting enforcement, and promoting white nationalist policies. Its annual report links Trump to Project 2025 and calls for a \u201cnew resistance.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump has turned the federal government into a weapon against civil rights. Protections are being gutted, and policies targeting Black Americans are accelerating under the guise of \u201cmerit.\u201dSource: Associated PressImmigrant father in the U.S. for 30 years is challenging warrantless ICE arrestsWhat Happened: Abel Orozco, an undocumented father living in the U.S. for 30 years with no criminal record, was arrested by ICE agents without a warrant while they searched for his son. Attorneys say the arrest violated a legal settlement requiring probable cause for warrantless arrests and are fighting for his release.Why It Matters: Orozco\u2019s case further exposes how Trump is bypassing legal safeguards and targeting long-time residents. Advocates warn the regime is cutting corners to inflate arrest numbers\u2014fueling family trauma, legal violations, racial profiling, and mass surveillance.Source: NBC NewsVeteran and US citizen arrested by ICE warns it could happen to anyoneWhat Happened: Army veteran George Retes, a U.S. citizen, was tear-gassed, beaten, and detained by ICE during a mass raid at a California farm, despite repeatedly stating his citizenship. He was held for three days without charges, a lawyer, or contact with his family.Why It Matters: This is proof that no one is safe. Under Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, U.S. citizens are being violently swept up, denied due process, and detained without explanation. It\u2019s racial profiling, plain and simple.Source: Military TimesFacing threats, leading human rights group exits El SalvadorWhat Happened: Cristosal, El Salvador\u2019s top human rights group, shut down and fled to Guatemala amid threats, surveillance, and the arrest of its anti-corruption lead. The crackdown follows a pattern of repression under President Nayib Bukele.Why It Matters: A close Trump ally, Bukele, is jailing critics and gutting civil society. Trump\u2019s migrant deportations to Bukele\u2019s gulags tie the U.S. directly to human rights abuses abroad.Source: NPRICE Agents Are Harassing the Courthouse Volunteers Who Assist Besieged ImmigrantsWhat Happened: ICE agents are intimidating and physically harassing court watchers in cities like Sacramento, San Diego, and Denver. Volunteers\u2014many older women\u2014report being shoved, photographed, threatened with facial recognition, and even detained while assisting immigrants at hearings.Why It Matters: These court watchers are often the only witnesses to ICE\u2019s arrests, which frequently target people with no criminal records. ICE\u2019s hostile response reveals a deeper intent: to operate in secrecy, using fear and force to stifle public oversight and suppress due process.Source: Mother JonesMigrants deported by the US to Eswatini being held in solitary confinementWhat Happened: Five men disappeared under Trump\u2019s third-country removal plan are now in solitary confinement in Eswatini, a monarchy known for torture. The U.S. claims their home countries refused reentry and bypassed the UN migration agency.Why It Matters: Trump continues disappearing immigrants to authoritarian regimes. It\u2019s a brutal policy revival that risks torture, indefinite detention, and total disregard for human rights.Source: The GuardianBorder Patrol Agents Raid a Home Depot in Northern CaliforniaWhat Happened: Border Patrol agents raided a Home Depot lot in Sacramento, arresting at least 11 undocumented immigrants\u2014expanding immigration sweeps into Northern California just after a court restricted such raids in L.A.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s agents continue targeting immigrant communities with militarized raids, using racial profiling to spread fear and undermine California\u2019s sanctuary protections\u2014while ignoring court orders.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch1.4M of the nation\u2019s poorest renters risk losing their homes with Trump\u2019s proposed HUD time limitWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s proposal to cap HUD rental assistance at two years would push 1.4 million low-income households out of subsidized housing, according to new NYU research. The plan targets working families like single mom Havalah Hopkins, who says it would leave her and her autistic son homeless.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s HUD policy would gut the housing safety net, punish the working poor, and destabilize millions of children\u2014all during a housing crisis. Experts warn it could spark mass evictions and deepen homelessness nationwide.Source: Associated Press RFK Jr. Wants to Change a Program That Stopped Vaccine Makers From Leaving the U.S. Market. They Could Flee Again.What Happened: RFK Jr. plans to overhaul the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, risking bankruptcy of the fund and driving vaccine makers out of the U.S. Experts say it could flood the system with baseless claims.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on America\u2019s vaccine infrastructure. Fueled by debunked anti-vax rhetoric, Kennedy\u2019s move threatens access to lifesaving immunizations\u2014just as preventable diseases like measles are on the rise.Source: ProPublicaWhat $9B spending cuts could mean for PBS, NPR stations, especially in rural areasWhat Happened: Congress passed Trump\u2019s rescissions bill, cutting $1.1 billion from public broadcasting, eliminating CPB funding for two years. NPR and PBS face major cuts, forcing rural stations into layoffs or closure.Why It Matters: This is an ideological attack on trusted public media. Millions will lose access to news, education, and life-saving alerts\u2014all to silence critical voices and reward partisan allies. Rural America will be hit hardest.Source: ABC NewsUS State Department draws criticism for shutting office that brings home deceased diplomatsWhat Happened: Trump officials eliminated the State Department\u2019s Office of Casualty Assistance\u2014responsible for returning the remains of U.S. diplomats killed abroad\u2014as part of a mass purge. The decision came while the office was handling the repatriation of a U.S. official who died in Mexico.Why It Matters: Shutting down the office that supports diplomats\u2019 families in times of tragedy is bureaucratic cruelty and a declaration that those serving America abroad are expendable. This move undermines morale, endangers recruitment, and signals total disregard for the human cost of foreign service.Source: ReutersState Department layoffs affect key Trump priorities like intelligence, energy and ChinaWhat Happened: Over 1,300 State Department employees were purged under Rubio\u2019s reorganization, including key experts on China, energy, and intelligence. The purge includes consular services, fraud investigations, Russia, and Ukraine analysts\u2014many with decades of experience.Why It Matters: The Trump-Rubio agenda is hollowing out U.S. foreign policy from within. By dismantling core expertise, they\u2019re handing power to adversaries and fueling dysfunction at the heart of American diplomacy.Source: Associated PressNew US postal chief confident agency will be able to preserve independenceWhat Happened: New Postmaster General David Steiner pledged to keep USPS independent, despite Trump\u2019s push to fold the agency into the Commerce Department. Steiner, a former FedEx board member, replaces Louis DeJoy and faces union skepticism.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s proposed USPS merger threatens to politicize a critical public service. With mail delivery, elections, and rural access at stake, the fight over postal independence is a battle for democratic infrastructure.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump administration tells embassies to rein in criticism of foreign electionsWhat Happened: The State Department has ordered embassies to stop criticizing foreign elections unless there\u2019s a \u201cclear and compelling\u201d U.S. interest. Under new guidance signed by Marco Rubio, diplomats are told to avoid commenting on fairness, legitimacy, or democratic values.Why It Matters: This silences America\u2019s traditional support for democracy abroad. By prioritizing \u201csovereignty\u201d over human rights, Trump continues aligning U.S. foreign policy with autocrats\u2014and abandoning pro-democracy voices worldwide.Source: Associated PressNew U.S. assessment finds American strikes destroyed only one of three Iranian nuclear sitesWhat Happened: A new intelligence review shows that U.S. airstrikes ordered by Trump last month only destroyed one of three targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The other two\u2014Natanz and Isfahan\u2014sustained limited damage and may be operational within months. Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s claims of \u201ctotal obliteration,\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains partially intact, and officials warn Tehran could quickly resume enrichment.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsGOP senators warn Trump that firing Powell would send \u2018shock wave\u2019 through economyWhat Happened: Republican senators\u2014including Trump allies\u2014are warning him not to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, calling it a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d that would undermine the Fed\u2019s independence, destabilize markets, and risk soaring debt costs.Why It Matters: Trump continues threatening to politicize monetary policy to force rate cuts, despite $36 trillion in national debt. Even his party worries that the move would crash markets and gut investor confidence in the U.S. economy.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News8/2- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Nationwide protests begin against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and health care cutsWhat Happened: Over 1,600 protests began across the U.S. as part of a \u201cGood Trouble Lives On\u201d day of action honoring John Lewis.

The move adds red tape to clean energy development while fast-tracking fossil fuels under Trump\\u2019s July 4 tax and energy law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is sabotaging clean energy at a critical moment\\u2014slowing approvals, driving up energy costs, and steering national policy back toward fossil fuels just as demand and climate urgency grow.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/burgum-trump-wind-solar-clean-energy-5f496ccc8b409edad853b35cc40728fb\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>In the Trump Administration, Watchdogs Are Watching Their Backs</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general since January, crippling government oversight and replacing independent watchdogs with loyalists.

ICE will reportedly gain access to this data.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is more surveillance disguised as policy.

In Colorado, officials say a former Boebert aide claimed to act on behalf of the White House to target Republican clerks in blue states.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is election interference from the inside and a threat to election integrity.

Trump is using the project to push Powell to resign or cut rates.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a coordinated pressure campaign. Trump is trying to intimidate an independent agency to manipulate interest rates for his political agenda. Undermining the Fed\\u2019s autonomy is a serious threat to the economy and democratic governance\\u2014and manufacturing crimes to justify it is exactly how authoritarian regimes like Russia operate.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/politics/white-house-seeks-to-inspect-fed-renovation-in-bid-to-pressure-powell.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Inside ICE\\u2019s Supercharged Facial Recognition App of 200 Million Images</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE\\u2019s new app, Mobile Fortify, lets agents scan a person\\u2019s face and instantly pull data from over 200 million images tied to DHS, State, CBP, FBI, and state records\\u2014returning names, nationalities, deportation orders, and more.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a dystopian leap in surveillance power.

It paves the way for a permanent military role in domestic affairs\\u2014just as Trump leans on the Pentagon to enforce his immigration agenda and suppress dissent.

In her farewell message, she urged colleagues not to give in to fear.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Comey\\u2019s firing is more political retaliation\\u2014punishing someone for their name, not misconduct.

The ask came from a Trump appointee, overriding civil rights precedent and outraging Taylor\\u2019s family.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a slap in the face to justice. One of the decade\\u2019s most infamous police killings is being treated as a minor offense\\u2014reiterating that under Trump, civil rights abuses by law enforcement will be excused.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/politics/justice-department-brett-hankison-sentence-breonna-taylor.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump administration hands over Medicaid recipients\\u2019 personal data, including addresses, to ICE</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed a secret agreement allowing ICE to access personal data\\u2014including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and ethnicities\\u2014of all Medicaid recipients to locate and deport undocumented immigrants. The data sharing affects 79 million enrollees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a massive breach of medical privacy and a weaponization of health care systems to fuel Trump\\u2019s deportation machine. It will deter millions from seeking lifesaving care\\u2014and the use of this data will only expand as surveillance deepens.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-medicaid-trump-ice-ab9c2267ce596089410387bfcb40eeb7\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Pulls $4 Billion from California High-Speed Rail Project</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump canceled $4 billion in funding for California\\u2019s high-speed rail, accusing the state of \\u201Cmismanagement and contract breaches.\\u201D Gov. Newsom called the move illegal and vowed to fight it.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This guts one of the largest green infrastructure projects in the country, threatening union jobs, transit innovation, and climate goals.

It\\u2019s the latest Trump crackdown on universities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing civil rights law to kill diversity programs and silence universities.
