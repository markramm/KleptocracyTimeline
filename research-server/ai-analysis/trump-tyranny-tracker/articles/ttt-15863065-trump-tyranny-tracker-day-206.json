The Office of Government Ethics warned Congress of the lapse, citing potential conflicts as Bessent shapes Trump\u2019s tax, trade, and deregulation agenda.Why It Matters: Bessent\u2019s delay underscores how Trump\u2019s cabinet continues to blur ethical lines, keeping personal stakes in sectors affected by their own policies. His farmland holdings\u2014directly tied to trade decisions with China\u2014pose a glaring conflict in a department steering U.S. economic policy.Source: New York TimesLeaving a top Trump administration post? The president may have an ambassadorship for youWhat Happened: Trump has begun handing out ambassadorships to ousted officials, reassigning loyalists instead of firing them. Mike Waltz, pushed out after national security failures, was nominated U.N. ambassador; ex-IRS chief Billy Long is headed to Iceland; and State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce was moved into a U.N. post after clashing with Marco Rubio.Why It Matters: Rather than risk bad press from firings, Trump recycles insiders into prestigious posts\u2014gutting merit-based diplomacy and undermining America\u2019s credibility on the world stage.Source: Associated PressTrump revokes Biden-era order on competition, White House saysWhat Happened: Trump scrapped Biden\u2019s 2021 executive order designed to promote competition and crack down on monopolistic practices across industries like airlines, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals. The Justice Department praised the move, saying it would replace Biden\u2019s \u201cburdensome\u201d approach with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First Antitrust,\u201d which streamlines merger reviews and favors consent decrees.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling protections that curbed corporate abuse, handing power back to monopolies and Wall Street. By gutting consumer safeguards, he\u2019s raising costs for ordinary Americans while rewarding the corporate elite who bankroll his presidency.Source: ReutersTexas Private Schools Hire Relatives and Enrich Insiders. Soon They Can Do It With Taxpayer Money.What Happened: A ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigation found over 60 cases of nepotism, self-dealing, and conflicts of interest at 27 Texas private schools\u2014actions that would be illegal in public schools. Despite this, Governor Abbott\u2019s new $1 billion voucher program allows these schools to tap taxpayer money with almost no oversight.Why It Matters: Texas is funneling public funds into private schools where boards hire relatives, cut insider contracts, and issue six-figure personal loans, with no transparency or accountability. Source: ProPublica\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Outlines Plan to Throw Out an Agency's FOIA Requests En MasseWhat Happened: The Department of Energy will close all FOIA requests filed before October 1, 2024\u2014potentially thousands\u2014unless requesters email within 30 days to confirm interest. Experts call the move unprecedented, possibly illegal, and a blatant attempt to slash the backlog by wiping out valid requests.Why It Matters: This guts one of the public\u2019s last tools for exposing government wrongdoing. If agencies can mass-cancel FOIA requests, they can hide records that reveal corruption or abuse.Source: 404 MediaAs Guard deploys, Trump to seek 'long-term' federal control of DC policeWhat Happened: Trump is seeking an open-ended extension of his takeover of the D.C. police force, launched under a declared public safety \u201cemergency.\u201d National Guard troops now patrol the National Mall, even as crime in the city has fallen over the past two years.Why It Matters: This is a major step toward a police state. By normalizing military patrols and sidelining local authority, Trump is turning D.C. into a stage for authoritarian theater and laying the groundwork for similar takeovers in other American cities.Source: ABC NewsTrump Floats Circumventing Congress to Maintain Control of DC PoliceWhat Happened: Trump suggested he could bypass Congress to extend his 30-day federal takeover of Washington\u2019s police by declaring a national emergency. He invoked the Home Rule Act for the initial takeover, deployed the National Guard, and said he is drafting a crime bill aimed first at D.C. but designed to spread to blue cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.Why It Matters: Trump is seizing local law enforcement, sidelining Congress, and laying the groundwork for federal takeovers of Democratic-run cities nationwide. It\u2019s a blueprint for using \u201cemergency\u201d powers to crush local autonomy and entrench control.Source: PoliticoThe CEO in chief: How Trump is getting what he wants from big businessWhat Happened: Trump is coercing companies into deals that serve his presidency, from demanding Nvidia and AMD hand the U.S. government a cut of China sales, to grabbing a \u201cGolden Share\u201d in the U.S. Steel\u2013Nippon merger, to extracting multimillion-dollar settlements from Disney and Paramount. CEOs like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook are lining up at the Oval Office with pledges and gifts, while others quietly comply to avoid reprisals.Why It Matters: This signals a move from free markets to Trump-controlled \u201cfee markets.\u201d By tying corporate decisions to presidential demands, Trump is steering U.S. business like an autocrat\u2014merging state and industry.Source: NBC NewsTrump Has Made Himself Commander-in-Chief of the Chip IndustryWhat Happened: Trump inserted himself into the $600 billion chip industry, dictating tariffs, export licenses, and even corporate leadership decisions. He demanded Nvidia pay a 15% cut for permission to sell AI chips to China, threatened Intel\u2019s CEO, and tied tariff relief to U.S. investments\u2014all while turning routine corporate strategy into direct White House bargaining.Why It Matters: By dictating deals and punishing companies at will, he will destabilize supply chains, shred market norms, and weaponize America\u2019s most vital technology industry\u2014much like Putin\u2019s control over various private sectors.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsD.C. Federal Deployment Ramps Up as Protesters Converge on Police CheckpointWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s federal takeover of D.C. policing escalated this week with 800 National Guard troops, 500 federal agents, and city police under his command. Protesters clashed with agents at a new checkpoint in the U Street corridor, chanting \u201cGo home fascists,\u201d as arrests mounted despite city crime rates being at historic lows.Why It Matters: Trump is militarizing Washington under a false pretext. By overriding local control and deploying soldiers in a city where crime is at historic lows, he is normalizing authoritarian policing and laying the groundwork for broader federal crackdowns.Source: New York TimesDemocrats say Trump is illegally blocking them from visiting Ice detention: \u2018The goal is to bully us\u2019What Happened: Democratic lawmakers are being denied access to ICE facilities, despite a federal law guaranteeing oversight. DHS now requires a week\u2019s notice and has guards physically block members of Congress, undermining surprise inspections that previously exposed overcrowding, hunger, and abuse.Why It Matters: Blocking elected officials from oversight guts checks and balances while concealing systemic abuse. With record ICE arrests and rising deaths in custody, Trump is using secrecy and intimidation to shield human rights violations from accountability.Source: The GuardianMan accused of throwing sandwich at US border agent charged with assaultWhat Happened: Sean Charles Dunn, 37, was charged with assaulting a federal officer after allegedly yelling \u201cfascists\u201d at US Customs and Border Protection agents and throwing a sandwich at one during Trump\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, DC. The federal case is being prosecuted by Trump-appointed US attorney Jeanine Pirro, who vowed to \u201cback the police to the hilt\u201d and fully prosecute him.Why It Matters: A minor protest act is being treated as a federal felony in the middle of Trump\u2019s aggressive law-and-order push in DC. The sandwich incident underscores how the regime is using harsh prosecutions to send a political message and intimidate dissent.Source: The GuardianThe Ice alert app founder sparking fury in Trump officials: \u2018Pam Bondi said I better watch out? Please.\u2019What Happened: Joshua Aaron, founder of IceBlock, an app alerting users to ICE raids, says Trump officials retaliated after its April launch. Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem denounced it as \u201cobstructing justice,\u201d extremists like Laura Loomer and Tom Homan piled on, the DOJ fired Aaron\u2019s wife, and AG Pam Bondi warned him to \u201cwatch out.\u201dWhy It Matters: The retaliation shows Trump\u2019s regime targeting not only immigrants but anyone who helps them. By punishing Aaron\u2019s family, the DOJ is using intimidation to silence legal, First Amendment\u2013protected tools, fueling a broader climate of fear.Source: The GuardianJudge says he's skeptical of a Trump lawsuit against every federal judge in MarylandWhat Happened: Trump officials filed an unprecedented lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over a standing order granting immigrants a two-day stay of deportation. The assigned judge questioned why DOJ bypassed normal appeals and instead sued the judiciary directly.Why It Matters: This is an extraordinary escalation of Trump\u2019s war on the courts. By suing judges en masse for protecting due process, the regime is trying to intimidate the judiciary and dismantle one of the last safeguards.Source: NBC NewsLAPD Eyes \u2018GeoSpy\u2019, an AI Tool That Can Geolocate Photos in SecondsWhat Happened: Public records show LAPD sought access to GeoSpy, an AI tool capable of pinpointing a photo\u2019s location within seconds\u2014even from indoor images\u2014by analyzing soil, architecture, and other visual cues. The tool\u2019s founder has showcased its use in tracking undocumented immigrants in sanctuary cities.Why It Matters: AI that can geolocate people from photos is a dangerous escalation in state surveillance. Once deployed, it can be used to hunt immigrants, journalists, activists, and political opponents\u2014eroding privacy and civil liberties in ways that, once normalized, will be almost impossible to undo.Source: 404 MediaSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump to host Kennedy Center Honors event as he expands his reach in WashingtonWhat Happened: Trump announced he will host this year\u2019s Kennedy Center Honors after personally approving honorees, rejecting artists he deemed \u201ctoo woke.\u201d Since naming himself chairman, he has stacked the board with loyalists, launched $200 million in renovations, and floated renaming it the Donald J. Trump Center for the Performing Arts.Why It Matters: Trump is turning America\u2019s leading arts institution into a political stage, imposing loyalty tests and erasing artistic independence. By remaking the Kennedy Center in his image, he extends authoritarian control into culture and rewrites national identity around himself.Source: ReutersHistorians Alarmed by Trump\u2019s White House Review of Smithsonian ExhibitsWhat Happened: Trump ordered a sweeping review of Smithsonian museum exhibits, demanding curators replace \u201cdivisive\u201d narratives with \u201cuplifting\u201d portrayals of American history. Historians and free speech groups warn that this amounts to political interference in museum content, echoing Trump\u2019s earlier push for \u201cpatriotic history.\u201dWhy It Matters: By pressuring the Smithsonian to align with White House ideology, Trump is undermining academic independence and turning museums into propaganda tools\u2014a tactic used in Russia, where history is rewritten to serve the regime and erase uncomfortable facts from public memory.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump defense official led think tank that spread lies about Tren de AraguaWhat Happened: Joseph Humire, newly appointed to a top Pentagon policy role, previously ran a think tank that fabricated entries in a tracker of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua activity. InSight Crime found several incidents were false or duplicated, inflating the gang\u2019s reach as Humire promoted the claims in Congress and on Fox News.Why It Matters: The appointment places a disinformation peddler in charge of U.S. defense policy for Latin America. Trump officials are weaponizing false narratives about Venezuela and Tren de Aragua to justify mass expulsions, invoke emergency powers, and push military escalation in the region.Source: The GuardianHomeless who refuse to cooperate with Trump crackdown may go to jail, White House saysWhat Happened: The White House announced that homeless people who refuse to cooperate with Trump\u2019s new crackdown could face jail time. The policy comes as federal agents and National Guard troops clear encampments in D.C. and other cities.Why It Matters: This criminalizes poverty. By threatening jail instead of providing housing or services, Trump is weaponizing homelessness as a political target\u2014turning marginalized Americans into test cases for mass policing and authoritarian control.Source: Reuters'He doesn't feel safe': Family speaks out after teen with disability is mistakenly detained by federal agentsWhat Happened: Federal agents in Los Angeles mistakenly detained 15-year-old Baldemar Gutierrez, a U.S. citizen with disabilities, at gunpoint outside his high school. He was handcuffed and interrogated before agents admitted their mistake, leaving bullets at the scene and brushing it off as an \u201cexciting story to tell.\u201dWhy It Matters: The raid highlights the reckless escalation of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown\u2014armed operations spilling into schools, traumatizing children, and ensnaring U.S. citizens. Mistaken identity, masked agents, and using weapons at a high school expose the lawless nature of Trump\u2019s enforcement machine.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Bureau of Labor Statistics nominee was a 'bystander' outside Capitol on Jan. 6, White House saysWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, was filmed on Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Antoni has echoed Trump\u2019s claims that jobs data is \u201crigged\u201d and pushed for suspending monthly reports.Why It Matters: Putting someone tied to Jan. 6 in charge of labor statistics drags insurrectionists into a core agency. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s wider effort to stock key posts with loyalists who will distort data and rewrite official numbers to serve his agenda.Source: NBC NewsFEMA abruptly disbands youth advisory council, but students say their climate advocacy won\u2019t stopWhat Happened: FEMA abruptly disbanded its 13-year-old Youth Preparedness Council, ending the program months early and canceling its annual summit. The move follows purges of FEMA staff, cuts to training and outreach, alongside the defunding of other youth and climate programs, such as AmeriCorps.Why It Matters: Gutting youth disaster programs wipes out the next generation of emergency managers and climate leaders. It\u2019s a deliberate step back from federal disaster response, leaving America weaker and more vulnerable as climate threats grow.Source: Associated PressCourt Lets Trump Block Billions of Dollars in Foreign AidWhat Happened: A U.S. appeals court ruled Trump can withhold billions in foreign assistance funds already approved by Congress, reversing a lower court ruling. The decision bolsters Trump\u2019s push to dismantle USAID and cut humanitarian programs, despite warnings that the freeze will worsen global crises like child malnutrition and malaria.Why It Matters: This hands Trump sweeping power to override Congress\u2019s spending authority, a direct threat to the separation of powers. By weaponizing aid cuts to advance his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, Trump is eroding both U.S. global leadership and the constitutional balance at home.Source: Bloomberg\u2018Severe\u2019 staff shortages at US veterans\u2019 hospitals, watchdog findsWhat Happened: A new inspector general report found nearly all VA hospitals face \u201csevere\u201d staff shortages, up 50% this year. Ninety-four percent of facilities lack doctors, 79% lack nurses, and psychology is the hardest-hit field\u2014fallout from Trump-era cuts that purged thousands of \u201cmission-critical\u201d healthcare jobs.Why It Matters: The VA, America\u2019s largest healthcare system, serves 9 million veterans. Trump\u2019s purge is gutting care, forcing closures and backlogs, and leaving veterans without essential services.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood threatens US healthcare system, study suggestsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s July tax-and-spending bill bans Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, though a lawsuit has temporarily paused enforcement. A new study shows the group provided over 1.5 million Medicaid visits in 2024, warning the ban would cripple the healthcare safety net and slash access to contraception.Why It Matters: Defunding Planned Parenthood would harm millions of low-income patients, drive up unintended pregnancies, and destabilize a healthcare system that relies on the organization to fill critical gaps.Source: The GuardianUSDA moves to end employee union contracts, documents showWhat Happened: The USDA moved to end union contracts for 6,500 food safety inspectors at FSIS and 1,650 plant health inspectors at APHIS, citing Trump\u2019s executive order excluding certain federal workers from collective bargaining under \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. Unions have filed lawsuits, arguing their work has nothing to do with national security.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling federal worker unions to consolidate control, stripping protections from frontline inspectors who safeguard America\u2019s food supply. This purge weakens workplace rights and public safety, turning vital agencies into tools of loyalty and political obedience.Source: ReutersmRNA technology could hold hope for fighting cancer, but future is in doubt under RFK Jr.What Happened: Trump halted $500 million in federal funding for mRNA research, a move championed by RFK Jr. Health experts warn this will derail progress not only on vaccines but also on treatments for cancers, autoimmune disorders, and rare genetic diseases. Why It Matters: This decision cripples one of the most promising fields in modern medicine for purely political reasons. By defunding mRNA, the regime is jeopardizing life-saving treatments for millions, trading away scientific progress and future cures for ideological gain.Source: CBS NewsThe Trump administration seeks to eliminate or privatize the Energy Star programWhat Happened: Trump officials are moving to eliminate or privatize the Energy Star program, which has saved Americans over $500 billion in energy costs since 1992. EPA chief Lee Zeldin dismissed the savings as inflated, while conservative groups and corporations lobby to take control of the program.Why It Matters: Killing Energy Star will hike household costs and stall climate progress, dismantling a trusted standard that helps consumers and businesses. It\u2019s another Trump push to gut environmental safeguards in favor of corporate interests over the public good.Source: NPR\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIsrael is in talks to possibly resettle Palestinians from Gaza in South SudanWhat Happened: Israel is holding talks with South Sudan to illegally expel Palestinians from Gaza under Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d plan, backed by Trump\u2019s push to relocate much of Gaza\u2019s population. South Sudan has officially denied the talks, but multiple officials confirmed discussions.Why It Matters: Expelling Palestinians into unstable, famine-stricken South Sudan would erase their homeland rights and pave the way for Israeli annexation of Gaza.Source: CNNVance Meets Reform Leader Farage Ahead of Crunch Ukraine TalksWhat Happened: JD Vance met with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage ahead of Trump\u2019s planned call with European leaders on Ukraine. The meeting came just days before Trump\u2019s summit with Putin, where Moscow is pressing Ukraine for territorial concessions.Why It Matters: Vance\u2019s outreach to Farage shows Trump\u2019s White House embracing Europe\u2019s pro-Kremlin far right while sidelining mainstream allies. This alignment reiterates U.S. readiness to try and hand away Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, fracture Western unity, and embolden Russian aggression.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchZelenskyy in Berlin for critical talks with European leaders and TrumpWhat Happened: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other European leaders in Berlin to rally support ahead of Trump\u2019s summit with Putin. European officials fear Trump may push a land-for-peace deal granting Moscow control of Ukrainian territory.Why It Matters: The meeting highlights Europe\u2019s alarm that Trump could legitimize Russia\u2019s genocidal territorial seizures. A U.S.-endorsed concession would embolden Putin to expand further, weaken NATO\u2019s eastern defenses, and fracture Western unity against aggression.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Pick to Lead Labor Data Agency Adds to Fears of Political InterferenceWhat Happened: Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics after a weak jobs report and nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni, a MAGA loyalist with little experience in labor data. Economists across the spectrum warned Antoni has misrepresented statistics in the past and could politicize one of the government\u2019s most trusted fact-based agencies.Why It Matters: This is an assault on the integrity of U.S. economic data. By installing a partisan figure to oversee jobs and inflation numbers, Trump risks turning neutral statistics into propaganda tools\u2014undermining policymaking, investor confidence, and public trust.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Trump ordered to restore some withheld grant funding to UCLAWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered Trump to reinstate suspended National Science Foundation grants to UCLA, ruling the cuts violated a prior court order. The NSF had pulled funding as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against universities that Trump deems politically hostile.Source: Associated PressDC residents protest as White House says federal agents will be on patrol 24/7What Happened: Protests erupted in Washington, D.C., after Trump expanded federal control over city policing, activating 800 National Guard troops and placing federal agents on constant street patrols. Despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, checkpoints, encampment clearances, and joint patrols with agencies like DHS and DEA have intensified.Source: Associated PressUS judge blocks Trump religious exemption to birth control coverageWhat Happened: A federal judge struck down Trump-era rules that allowed any employer with religious or moral objections to opt out of providing birth control coverage. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled the 2018 exemption was overly broad and lacked a rational connection to the problem it claimed to address.Source: ReutersGroups sue Trump agencies for using 'secret' report to reverse core of US climate rulesWhat Happened: Environmental groups sued the EPA and the Energy Department, accusing them of illegally using a secret report by climate skeptics to justify overturning the Endangerment Finding\u2014the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases. The lawsuit says the report was produced in violation of federal transparency laws and undermines established climate science.Source: Reuters\u2018Stop Trump\u2019 protesters target JD Vance\u2019s UK summer tripWhat Happened: JD Vance\u2019s vacation in the Cotswolds drew a \u201cVance not welcome party,\u201d organized by the Stop Trump Coalition. Around 80 locals staged a protest with placards, memes, and mock cakes, citing Vance\u2019s criticism of the UK and Trump\u2019s positions on Ukraine and Gaza.Source: CNBCNew York sues Zelle, says security lapses led to $1 billion consumer fraud lossesWhat Happened: New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Zelle, alleging the payment app ignored basic anti-fraud safeguards that let criminals steal over $1 billion from consumers.

So sad! We are the world\u2019s wealthiest country. We just increased taxes on and stripped benefits from the poor\u2014all to feed the WEALTHY. Uncaringly ruthless Republicans, bought off by the WEALTHY, have an agenda of pain and suffering for the poor, the needy, the sinking middle class. For heaven\u2019s sake, give heathcare, childcare, food assistance, and LIVING wages to everyone. Charge the total cost to the WEALTHY billionaires. They cannot be satisfied, and need their greedy asses kicked for this carnage. They are funding the ruthlessness; they are gouging and gorging. To what purpose is their $ billions? Hoarding alone. Outlaw this hoarding! They cannot spend it all, yet they fund tax cuts only for themselves. Sound about right to you? I made protest signs for your upcoming protests. Protesting is now critical for Occupied D.C. We must fill the streets! There is just enough time to get signs printed for your protest group.
