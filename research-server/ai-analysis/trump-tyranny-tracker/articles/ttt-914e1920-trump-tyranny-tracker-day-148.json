The phones are marketed as \u201cU.S.-made,\u201d though experts doubt the feasibility, citing a lack of supply chain clarity.Why It Matters: This expands Trump\u2019s self-enrichment while in office and opens the door to surveillance or influence over users. With control of a phone service, Trump could access call data and weaponize federal agencies against competitors. It\u2019s another corrupt step in turning the presidency into a profit center.Source: Washington PostThe Trumps Promote a New Crypto Venture: Bitcoin MiningWhat Happened: Eric and Donald Trump Jr. launched American Bitcoin, a mining firm they claim will benefit from their father\u2019s pro-crypto, low-cost energy policies. The company controls millions in Bitcoin and plans to go public, while relying on Chinese mining hardware despite Trump\u2019s previous tariff threats.Why It Matters: The venture tightens the Trump family\u2019s grip on industries influenced by White House policy. It shows how Trump\u2019s tariff threats and deregulation aren\u2019t just political moves\u2014they\u2019re business strategies that will funnel money back into his pocket.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsJustice Department\u2019s early moves on voting and elections signal a shift from its traditional roleWhat Happened: The DOJ launched investigations and legal actions in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Colorado, focusing on voter registration records and technical election procedures, while quietly dropping key voting rights cases and seeing longtime civil rights attorneys depart.Why It Matters: This marks a stark shift from protecting ballot access to pursuing conspiracies, signaling a weaponization of the DOJ to cast doubt on elections and lay the groundwork to challenge unfavorable results in 2026 and 2028.Source: Associated Press\u2018Golden Share\u2019 in U.S. Steel Gives Trump Extraordinary ControlWhat Happened: To secure Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U.S. Steel, Trump forced the creation of a \u201cgolden share\u201d that gives the president permanent veto power over key decisions like outsourcing, plant closures, and board appointments\u2014marking an unprecedented federal stake in a private company.Why It Matters: This breaks with U.S. free-market tradition and mirrors practices in authoritarian regimes like Russia and China, where state control over companies is routine. The deal sets a dangerous precedent for future foreign investment and expands presidential power over the private sector.Source: New York TimesTrump Promises Expanded Immigration Crackdown After \u2018No Kings\u2019 ProtestsWhat Happened: In response to nationwide \"No Kings\" protests, Trump vowed to escalate mass deportations in Democratic-led cities like Los Angeles and New York. Despite ICE being $1 billion over budget, Trump pledged to redirect federal funds if Congress blocks his immigration spending bill.Why It Matters: Trump is turning federal law enforcement into a political weapon, punishing blue cities while protecting allies. His embrace of far-right extremist language like \u201cremigration\u201d and calls for mass deportation shows how authoritarian ideology is now driving state policy.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions News\u2018Extremely disturbing and unethical\u2019: new rules allow VA doctors to refuse to treat Democrats, unmarried veteransWhat Happened: Following a Trump executive order, new VA rules allow doctors and staff to deny care based on marital status or political affiliation. Protections for political party, national origin, and union activity were stripped from staff and patient bylaws.Why It Matters: This paves the way for political interference in veteran healthcare, enabling discrimination and threatening access to critical services for those who served.Source: The GuardianTrump directs immigration authorities to prioritize deportations in Democratic-run citiesWhat Happened: Trump ordered ICE to prioritize deportations in Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, claiming they are \u201cpower centers\u201d for \u201cillegal voting and welfare fraud.\u201d The directive follows large-scale anti-ICE protests and contradicts his earlier pause on workplace raids after industry backlash.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass raids in Democratic cities mark an authoritarian use of federal power to punish political enemies, inflame division, and destabilize democratic institutions\u2014while trampling on state sovereignty.Source: CBS News and BloombergInside DOGE\u2019s Chaotic Takeover of Social SecurityWhat Happened: A New York Times investigation reveals that Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE team spread false fraud claims at the Social Security Administration to justify mass firings and gain access to Americans\u2019 data. Backed by Trump, they ignored court orders, forced leadership changes, and politicized operations.Why It Matters: Musk and Trump used disinformation to destabilize a key agency serving 74 million Americans. The episode shows how DOGE is being weaponized to dismantle public institutions and seize control of federal data systems.Source: New York TimesThe High-Flying Escalation of CBP\u2019s Predator Drone Flights Over LAWhat Happened: U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed it is flying Predator B military drones over Los Angeles alongside 700 Marines and 4,000 federalized National Guard troops, aiding ICE and federal law enforcement during mass protests\u2014without state consent.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s use of war-zone surveillance tech on U.S. soil signals a dangerous escalation in domestic militarization, erodes civil liberties, and lays the groundwork for a police and surveillance state.Source: WIREDSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsUN Rights Chief Warns U.S. Against Using Military on Anti-Trump ProtestersWhat Happened: UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk urged U.S. authorities to respect peaceful protest rights and avoid deploying military force during mass demonstrations against Trump\u2019s actions. His remarks came during a broad address to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.Why It Matters: The warning follows reports of militarized crackdowns on dissent. T\u00fcrk\u2019s statement highlights rising international alarm over U.S. civil liberties violations.Source: ReutersPress Groups Sue L.A. Over Police Violence Against Journalists at ICE ProtestsWhat Happened: The Los Angeles Press Club and Status Coup sued LAPD and federal agencies, alleging journalists covering anti-ICE protests were assaulted and intimidated. At least 36 incidents detail reporters being shot, shoved, detained, and targeted despite visible press credentials.Why It Matters: This highlights the erosion of press freedom amid Trump\u2019s militarized immigration crackdown. Escalating violence against journalists threatens transparency, accountability, and core democratic rights.Source: NPRThe Rise of Political Violence and Targeting of Lawmakers in the U.S.What Happened: Two Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota were shot in targeted attacks. Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed; Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded. The shooter, impersonating a police officer, left a manifesto naming more targets.Why It Matters: This attack is a stark escalation in America\u2019s growing political violence crisis\u2014fueled by dangerous rhetoric from Trump and other politicians targeting their opponents. With threats against officials doubling since January 6, experts warn the U.S. is entering its most dangerous era of political violence since the 1970s.Source: TIME\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsJustice Department Moves to Dismiss Naval Academy Affirmative Action LawsuitWhat Happened: The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit over race-conscious admissions at the Naval Academy after the school dropped the policy under Trump\u2019s directive. Both the DOJ and the suing group agreed that the case is now moot.Why It Matters: This marks the end of affirmative action at U.S. military academies. Civil rights advocates warn it will slash diversity in officer ranks and entrench inequality in military leadership.Source: ReutersEmails Reveal Casual Surveillance Alliance Between ICE and Local Oregon PoliceWhat Happened: Internal emails reveal Oregon police analysts offered surveillance assistance to federal agents, including ICE, through an informal \u201cSouthern Oregon Analyst Group.\u201d They shared license plate data, social media tactics, and surveillance tools\u2014bypassing legal oversight and violating state sanctuary laws.Why It Matters: The revelations show how local police are acting as surveillance proxies for federal agencies, undermining civil liberties and enabling mass monitoring of protests and immigrants. These informal networks exploit state protections, creating loopholes ripe for abuse.Source: 404 MediaICE Raids Spark Protests, Fear, and Family Separations Across Los AngelesWhat Happened: A surge of aggressive ICE raids in Los Angeles, including arrests at routine check-ins, triggered mass protests, curfews, and the first-ever deployment of U.S. troops to the city. Dozens of immigrant families were detained or separated, fueling nationwide demonstrations.Why It Matters: The raids reveal the devastating impact of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown\u2014tearing apart families and targeting longtime residents. With military force used against protestors and ICE operating in secrecy, civil liberties and public trust are under siege. Cruelty is the point.Source: CNNICE Arrests of Migrants With No Criminal History Surging Under TrumpWhat Happened: A Guardian analysis reveals an 807% increase in arrests of immigrants with no criminal record since Trump\u2019s return to office, contradicting his claims that ICE is only targeting \u201ccriminals.\u201d Internal memos show ICE agents are being pushed to hit mass arrest quotas\u2014sweeping up bystanders and asylum seekers at court, while overcrowded detention facilities reach record levels.Why It Matters: The data exposes Trump\u2019s deceptive narrative and signals a dangerous escalation of mass deportation tactics, criminalizing undocumented status and overwhelming the immigration system with no regard for human rights, due process, or public safety priorities.Source: The GuardianThe Army Was the Only Life She Knew. Trump\u2019s Trans Ban Cast Her Out.What Happened: Maj. Erica Vandal, a decorated transgender Army officer and combat veteran, was expelled after the Supreme Court upheld Trump\u2019s ban on trans service members. Vandal had served for 14 years and was in line for battalion command before the reversal of Obama-era protections.Why It Matters: Her removal reflects the impact of Trump\u2019s anti-trans policies\u2014purging qualified troops based on identity, not ability. It\u2019s part of a broader attack on LGBTQ+ rights.Source: New York TimesTrump weighs adding 36 countries to travel ban, memo saysWhat Happened: Trump is weighing a ban on entry from 36 additional countries, citing weak passport systems, terrorism concerns, and deportation noncompliance. A State Department cable signed by Marco Rubio gives these nations 60 days to meet U.S. demands or face restrictions on entry.Why It Matters: This dramatic expansion echoes Trump\u2019s first-term travel ban, targeting mostly African and low-income nations. Critics warn it enshrines discrimination into immigration policy and uses national security as a pretext for sweeping xenophobic measures.Source: ReutersReport: New Hampshire Could Ban Funding for Programs for Disabled PeopleWhat Happened: New Hampshire\u2019s GOP-led Senate added language to the state budget that could ban public funding for programs supporting disabled people, casting it as part of an anti-DEI push. Why It Matters: Disability advocates warn this would slash vital services, inclusion efforts, and education programs, jeopardizing funding for schools that promote neurodiversity or support disabled students. The move signals how Trump\u2019s anti-DEI agenda is expanding to target disability rights.Source: Mother Jones\u201cA Direct Attack on Women\u201d: Lawmakers Demand Labor Secretary Preserve the Women\u2019s BureauWhat Happened: Democratic lawmakers are urging Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to stop Trump\u2019s plan to shut down the 105-year-old Women\u2019s Bureau, following revelations that grants supporting women in trades were already cut by Musk.Why It Matters: The bureau, once central to advancing women\u2019s labor rights, has been gutted\u2014losing half its staff and freezing programs. Lawmakers call it \u201ca direct attack on women,\u201d warning it could undo decades of progress on gender equity in the workforce.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchCDC official in charge of Covid data resigns ahead of vaccine meetingWhat Happened: Dr. Fiona Havers, who led CDC surveillance on Covid and RSV hospitalizations, resigned ahead of a key vaccine meeting, citing concerns that data would no longer be used with scientific rigor. Her departure follows RFK Jr.\u2019s purging of the CDC\u2019s entire vaccine advisory panel and appointment of vaccine skeptics.Why It Matters: Havers\u2019 resignation exposes the CDC\u2019s collapse into political control, with vaccine policy now shaped by ideology, not science. Experts warn this endangers public trust and risks deadly outbreaks.Source: The GuardianFired members say Kennedy's vaccine panel shake-up weakens US immunization programWhat Happened: RFK Jr. fired all 17 members of the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel and replaced them with eight new appointees, some of whom oppose vaccines. The ousted members say the abrupt overhaul, along with CDC staff cuts, endangers public access to lifesaving immunizations.Why It Matters: Kennedy is dismantling decades of vaccine progress, politicizing public health, and fueling distrust in immunization. His actions risk deadly disease outbreaks and show how anti-science extremism is now federal policy.Source: Reuters\u2018No Way to Invest in a Career Here\u2019: Trump\u2019s Crackdown Fuels Academic ExodusWhat Happened: Faced with federal research cuts, anti-science policies, and political repression under Trump, young academics and international scholars are fleeing the U.S. for safer, better-funded institutions abroad. Visa suspensions, grant revocations, ICE targeting, and censorship have sparked a growing exodus.Why It Matters: The U.S. is hemorrhaging talent once drawn by its academic freedom, resulting in long-term damage to science, innovation, and global leadership. Trump\u2019s war on research is triggering a historic brain drain.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump to Leave G7 Early to Monitor Israel-Iran CrisisWhat Happened: Trump is leaving the G7 summit early to oversee the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, warning Iranians to evacuate Tehran and pushing for urgent talks. Why It Matters: Calling for the evacuation of Tehran\u2014a city of 10 million\u2014and broadcasting war threats on his social media platform is reckless and dangerous. His push to cast Putin as a mediator, despite Russia\u2019s ongoing genocidal invasion of Ukraine, further isolates the U.S. and undermines global trust.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Renews Embrace of Putin Amid Rift With AlliesWhat Happened: At the G7 summit, Trump opened by defending Russia\u2019s 2014 expulsion from the group, falsely blaming Obama and Trudeau (who wasn\u2019t PM at the time), and absurdly claiming Russia wouldn\u2019t have invaded Ukraine if it hadn\u2019t been kicked out\u2014despite being expelled for invading Ukraine. He called for Putin\u2019s return, claimed Putin only speaks to him, criticized Ukraine\u2019s president, downplayed European sanctions, and suggested Putin could mediate the Middle East conflict.Why It Matters: Trump acts as a lobbyist for Russia, using every opportunity to normalize Putin on the global stage\u2014even as Russia wages a genocidal war in Ukraine. His G7 remarks further isolate the U.S., undermine NATO cohesion, and reiterate a dangerous alignment with authoritarian power over democratic alliances.Source: New York TimesTrump disbands group focused on pressuring RussiaWhat Happened: Trump quietly disbanded a high-level interagency working group tasked with developing strategies to pressure Russia into talks with Ukraine. The group, formed earlier in 2025, lost momentum after Trump showed little interest in confronting the Kremlin and purged the National Security Council team working on Ukraine policy.Why It Matters: The move shows that Trump\u2019s goal was to force Ukraine\u2019s surrender while shoring up loyalty to Putin. Disbanding the Russia pressure group weakens NATO unity, erodes U.S. deterrence, and emboldens Moscow.Source: ReutersTired of military aid delays, Ukraine has designed its own ballistic missile \u2014 and it\u2019s already in mass-productionWhat Happened: Ukraine has begun mass production of its domestically developed short-range ballistic missile, the Sapsan, after successful combat testing. With a range of at least 300 kilometers and a warhead exceeding 480 kilograms, it marks a major leap in Ukraine's independent defense capability amid inconsistent Western military support.Why It Matters: This marks a major step in Ukraine\u2019s military self-reliance\u2014filling the gap left by delayed Western aid. As the first European country since the Cold War to produce conventional ballistic missiles, Ukraine is outpacing its allies and reshaping the war on its own terms.Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s \u2018revenge tax\u2019 could threaten foreign investment into US, analysts sayWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s bill includes section 899, which would impose escalating taxes on entities from countries with \u201cunfair\u201d tax policies targeting U.S. companies. The tax could reach 20% and target jurisdictions with digital services and diverted profits taxes.Why It Matters: Analysts warn it could deter foreign investment and push companies to move listings to the U.S. It may also undermine the dollar\u2019s safe-haven status and provoke global tax disputes.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Trade and Tax Policies Start to Stall U.S. Battery BoomWhat Happened: Battery companies are halting or scaling back U.S. projects due to Trump\u2019s China tariffs and GOP efforts to block tax credits tied to Chinese technology. Factories in Michigan, South Carolina, and Washington are pausing construction or redirecting production overseas.Why It Matters: The shift threatens to stall America\u2019s battery boom, undermine EV manufacturing, and slow climate innovation. Experts warn the policies could cripple U.S. competitiveness in a sector still reliant on Chinese supply chains.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Harvard Wins Temporary Extension Blocking Trump\u2019s Ban on International StudentsWhat Happened: A federal judge extended a temporary order blocking Trump\u2019s proclamation that bars foreign students from attending Harvard, citing potential First Amendment violations and harm to the university. The ruling comes amid broader attacks by Trump, including frozen funding and revoked certifications.Source: ReutersAmerican Bar Association sues to block Trump's attacks on law firmsWhat Happened: The American Bar Association filed a federal lawsuit accusing Trump of targeting law firms with executive orders that revoked security clearances and restricted government access based on past clients and legal work. The ABA argues these actions violate constitutional protections and chill legal advocacy.Source: ReutersJudge Rules Trump\u2019s NIH Grant Cuts IllegalWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that Trump\u2019s termination of NIH research grants tied to diversity and LGBTQ topics was \u201cvoid and illegal,\u201d accusing it of racial and anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, reinstated over $1 billion in grants and said he may expand the order further.Source: NBC NewsWatchdog Finds Trump Broke Law by Withholding Library FundsWhat Happened: The Government Accountability Office ruled that Trump illegally withheld funds from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, violating anti-impoundment laws meant to stop presidents from overriding congressional spending decisions.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers7/17 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action807% \u2014 Increase in ICE arrests of non-criminal immigrants since Trump\u2019s return74 million \u2014 Americans served by Social Security Administration targeted by Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE36 \u2014 Countries Trump is considering adding to travel ban4,000 \u2014 National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles without state consent105 \u2014 Years the Women\u2019s Bureau existed before Trump\u2019s plan to shut it down14 \u2014 Years Maj.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Public Institutions Under Siege \u2014 From Social Security to the CDC, Trump is politicizing and purging agencies to consolidate control and dismantle democratic governance.Surveillance State Rising \u2014 Military drones over Los Angeles, Predator tech turned inward, and DOGE\u2019s unauthorized data grabs signal a dangerous shift toward surveillance.Weaponizing the Presidency for Profit \u2014 Trump Mobile and crypto mining ventures show how Trump continues monetizing executive power while shaping federal policy to enrich himself and his family.Authoritarian Use of Federal Power \u2014 Targeting Democratic cities with mass raids, deportations, and service cutbacks reveals how Trump is weaponizing institutions to punish opponents and override state sovereignty.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

The phones are marketed as \\u201CU.S.-made,\\u201D though experts doubt the feasibility, citing a lack of supply chain clarity.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This expands Trump\\u2019s self-enrichment while in office and opens the door to surveillance or influence over users. With control of a phone service, Trump could access call data and weaponize federal agencies against competitors.

The company controls millions in Bitcoin and plans to go public, while relying on Chinese mining hardware despite Trump\\u2019s previous tariff threats.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The venture tightens the Trump family\\u2019s grip on industries influenced by White House policy.

Despite ICE being $1 billion over budget, Trump pledged to redirect federal funds if Congress blocks his immigration spending bill.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is turning federal law enforcement into a political weapon, punishing blue cities while protecting allies.

Backed by Trump, they ignored court orders, forced leadership changes, and politicized operations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk and Trump used disinformation to destabilize a key agency serving 74 million Americans.

With threats against officials doubling since January 6, experts warn the U.S. is entering its most dangerous era of political violence since the 1970s.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://time.com/7294891/political-violence-rise-america/\\\\\\\">TIME</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Justice Department Moves to Dismiss Naval Academy Affirmative Action Lawsuit</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit over race-conscious admissions at the Naval Academy after the school dropped the policy under Trump\\u2019s directive. Both the DOJ and the suing group agreed that the case is now moot.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks the end of affirmative action at U.S. military academies.

Dozens of immigrant families were detained or separated, fueling nationwide demonstrations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The raids reveal the devastating impact of Trump\\u2019s immigration crackdown\\u2014tearing apart families and targeting longtime residents. With military force used against protestors and ICE operating in secrecy, civil liberties and public trust are under siege.

Vandal had served for 14 years and was in line for battalion command before the reversal of Obama-era protections.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Her removal reflects the impact of Trump\\u2019s anti-trans policies\\u2014purging qualified troops based on identity, not ability.

A State Department cable signed by Marco Rubio gives these nations 60 days to meet U.S. demands or face restrictions on entry.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This dramatic expansion echoes Trump\\u2019s first-term travel ban, targeting mostly African and low-income nations.

Her departure follows RFK Jr.\\u2019s purging of the CDC\\u2019s entire vaccine advisory panel and appointment of vaccine skeptics.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Havers\\u2019 resignation exposes the CDC\\u2019s collapse into political control, with vaccine policy now shaped by ideology, not science.

The ousted members say the abrupt overhaul, along with CDC staff cuts, endangers public access to lifesaving immunizations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Kennedy is dismantling decades of vaccine progress, politicizing public health, and fueling distrust in immunization.

Visa suspensions, grant revocations, ICE targeting, and censorship have sparked a growing exodus.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The U.S. is hemorrhaging talent once drawn by its academic freedom, resulting in long-term damage to science, innovation, and global leadership.

He called for Putin\\u2019s return, claimed Putin only speaks to him, criticized Ukraine\\u2019s president, downplayed European sanctions, and suggested Putin could mediate the Middle East conflict.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump acts as a lobbyist for Russia, using every opportunity to normalize Putin on the global stage\\u2014even as Russia wages a genocidal war in Ukraine.
