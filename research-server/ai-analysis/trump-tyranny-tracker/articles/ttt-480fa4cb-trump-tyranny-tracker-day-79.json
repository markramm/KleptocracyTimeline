Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says enforcement will now focus only on fraud or crypto used for crimes like trafficking or terrorism.Why It Matters: The move is part of Trump\u2019s broader deregulatory push to boost the crypto industry\u2014regardless of rising fraud and money laundering. Trump is gutting accountability as crypto scams are exploding. Meanwhile, Trump and his family continue deepening their own crypto ventures, highlighting conflicts of interest and self-enrichment.Source: Associated PressMar-a-Lago to Get $1.8 Million in Taxpayer-Funded Security Upgrades While Trump Slashes Public SpendingWhat Happened: Trump approved $1.82 million in taxpayer-funded \u201csecurity enhancements\u201d at Mar-a-Lago. This is as Musk guts funding for pediatric cancer research, public libraries, and food aid for children and seniors while purging tens of thousands of federal workers.Why It Matters: The Secret Service claims the upgrades are standard, but it is blatant self-enrichment as Trump dismantles programs that serve Americans. Trump\u2019s weekly trips to Mar-a-Lago already cost taxpayers $3.4 million each.Source: The IndependentAdams Will Give ICE Space to Operate on Rikers IslandWhat Happened: Mayor Eric Adams signed an executive order allowing ICE to operate office space within Rikers Island jail. The order, issued by First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, claims ICE and other federal agencies like the FBI and ATF will assist in \u201ccriminal\u201d\u2014not immigration\u2014investigations alongside the Department of Correction\u2019s intelligence bureau.Why It Matters: ICE hasn\u2019t had access to Rikers since New York passed sanctuary laws in 2014. Critics say the move could open the door to civil immigration enforcement, especially after Trump illegally dropped a corruption case against Adams.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump and DOGE Are \u2018Trying to Get Around\u2019 Privacy Laws to Gather Your Personal InfoWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s operatives have accessed massive amounts of sensitive personal data across federal agencies\u2014including Social Security, Treasury, and OPM\u2014despite court rulings, privacy laws, and widespread outrage.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are building a vast surveillance apparatus, violating the Privacy Act to collect data on millions, including judges, immigrants, and political opponents\u2014 and using executive orders to crush oversight. A classic authoritarian tactic.Source: Rolling StoneActing IRS Commissioner Resigns After Data-Sharing Deal With DHSWhat Happened: Acting IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause resigned after learning the agency finalized a deal with the Department of Homeland Security to share taxpayer data with immigration authorities\u2014an agreement she had not approved in its final form. The deal has triggered multiple resignations and chaos within the IRS.Why It Matters: This controversial \u2014 and likely illegal \u2014 data-sharing agreement, coupled with growing internal upheaval and Trump\u2019s push to redirect IRS resources toward immigration enforcement, marks a dramatic shift in the agency\u2019s mission. It undermines taxpayer privacy, chills compliance, and weaponizes the IRS for political purposes.

Unauthorized FAKE DOGE is reportedly deploying Musk's AI chatbot Grok and the encrypted app Signal, raising legal and ethical concerns over surveillance, transparency, and federal record-keeping laws.Why It Matters: This surveillance marks an unprecedented move to root out \u201canti-Trump\u201d sentiment inside the federal government. It likely violates federal laws, chills free speech, and reflects an authoritarian push to weaponize tech for political loyalty checks. This is how Russia operates to silence dissent, surveil government employees, and enforce political loyalty to maintain power.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s IRS-ICE Deal Sparks Mass Resignations, Fears of Immigrant TargetingWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime has finalized a controversial agreement allowing ICE to access confidential IRS taxpayer data to aid in deportations.

Why It Matters: This task force is not about transparency\u2014it\u2019s about political retribution. It\u2019s a blunt instrument designed to rewrite history, discredit legitimate investigations, and intimidate Trump\u2019s \u201cperceived enemies.\u201d Trump and Gabbard are turning intelligence oversight into a loyalty test, undermining public trust in America\u2019s spy agencies and transforming them into partisan tools.Source: USA TodayTexas Governor Under Fire for Delaying Special Election to NovemberWhat Happened: Gov. Greg Abbott announced the special election to fill the late Rep. Sylvester Turner\u2019s congressional seat won\u2019t happen until Nov. 4 \u2014 eight months after Turner\u2019s death. Democrats say Abbott is stalling to protect the GOP\u2019s slim House majority in a solidly blue district.Why It Matters: The delay leaves over 700,000 Texans without representation in Congress amid major federal decisions. Abbott is manipulating the election calendar for partisan gain\u2014an undemocratic move that undermines fair representation.Source: ABC NewsFBI Creates Multiagent Bodyguard Team to Protect Dan BonginoWhat Happened: The FBI has assembled a rotating security detail for Deputy Director Dan Bongino, the first time in bureau history that the No. 2 official receives full-time protection. Bongino, an extremist pro-Trump podcaster, and non-career agent, now requires up to 20 agents for 24/7 protection \u2014 a move that deviates from past norms and strains bureau resources.Why It Matters: This unprecedented security detail is an insane misuse of taxpayer money and FBI manpower. Bongino is pulling agents from real fieldwork to guard him.Source: NBC NewsBondi: Justice Department cut funding for Maine corrections department over transgender inmateWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the Justice Department revoked over $1.5 million in federal funding from the Maine Department of Corrections after discovering a transgender woman was placed in a women\u2019s prison. Bondi claimed the inmate was \u201ca guy,\u201d and the DOJ deemed the funding \"nonessential.\"Why It Matters: This is political retribution. The funding cuts hit critical programs\u2014substance abuse treatment and support for kids with incarcerated parents\u2014but the real reason is clear: Maine\u2019s governor publicly challenged Trump. Now the regime is punishing the state, weaponizing federal dollars to bully governors who refuse to fall in line.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsRepublicans Are Stealing a North Carolina Judicial Race. They Won\u2019t Stop There.What Happened: Republican judges in North Carolina moved to throw out over 60,000 ballots in a state Supreme Court race narrowly won by Democrat Allison Riggs. Despite two recounts confirming her win, GOP candidate Jefferson Griffin\u2014backed by partisan judges\u2014is trying to retroactively change election rules to flip the outcome. The ballots in question overwhelmingly came from Democratic-leaning voters, including overseas military personnel and voters with minor clerical registration issues.Why It Matters: Legal experts warn this is a blueprint for overturning elections after the fact\u2014without evidence of fraud. It\u2019s the \u201cBig Lie\u201d in action through the courts, and if successful, could mainstream election subversion as a GOP strategy going into 2026 and 2028.Source: Mother JonesTrump freezes funding for Cornell, Northwestern University in latest crackdownWhat Happened: Trump has frozen $1 billion for Cornell and $790 million for Northwestern over ongoing investigations into alleged civil rights \u201cviolations,\u201d citing pro-Palestinian protests, DEI programs, and transgender policies. The move is part of a broader crackdown affecting over 60 schools nationwide.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal funding as a weapon to reshape higher education into a conservative stronghold, threatening academic freedom, free speech, student activism, and research programs. Universities that resist risk losing crucial federal grants and student aid, forcing them into compliance. This is an authoritarian takeover of higher education.Source: ReutersTrump pulling nearly $4 million in funding from Princeton over climate-related programsWhat Happened: Trump has suspended $4 million in climate research grants to Princeton University, citing a misalignment with the regime\u2019s priorities. The Department of Commerce said NOAA-funded programs like CIMES contributed to \"climate anxiety\" and exaggerated threats related to global warming.Why It Matters: This is an ideological takeover. Pulling climate research funding from Princeton isn\u2019t about science\u2014it\u2019s about silencing it. Trump is gutting environmental programs that challenge his narrative, replacing evidence-based research with political obedience. This is an authoritarian takeover of higher education.Source: The HillKaroline Leavitt Takes Swipe at Amy Coney Barrett BetrayalWhat Happened: After Justice Amy Coney Barrett broke ranks with her conservative peers in a 5\u20134 Supreme Court decision against Trump\u2019s deportation push, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt celebrated the ruling\u2014but made a pointed, veiled jab at Barrett for her perceived \u201cbetrayal.\u201d Why It Matters: This is about loyalty, not law. Trump and his allies expect the judges they appointed to serve the regime\u2014not the Constitution. Independence is treated like betrayal.Source: The Daily Beast\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsHer Husband Is Trapped in a Salvadoran Prison. She Has No Idea How to Get Him BackWhat Happened: Julio Zambrano Perez, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker with no criminal record, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in and secretly disappeared to El Salvador. He now sits in CECOT while his wife Luz, who recently gave birth, struggles for answers.Why It Matters: This illustrates the cruelty and chaos of Trump\u2019s deportation regime\u2014where asylum seekers are vanished into foreign prisons with no due process, often based on nothing more than tattoos. Families are shattered, legal protections are ignored, even as the regime admits it deported people illegally\u2014yet refuses to bring them back.Source: Mother Jones\u201cThey Don\u2019t Care About Civil Rights\u201d: Trump\u2019s Shuttering of DHS Oversight Arm Freezes 600 Cases, Imperils Human RightsWhat Happened: Trump has eliminated the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, firing nearly all 150 staff and halting 600 ongoing civil rights abuse investigations. The office, long seen as a watchdog against abuses by DHS personnel, was disbanded. CRCL had investigated misconduct ranging from sexual abuse by border agents to FEMA bias and facial recognition overreach by ICE.Why It Matters: By dismantling DHS\u2019s civil rights office, Trump has eliminated one of its last internal checks on abuse. It sends a clear message: civil liberties don\u2019t matter. As mass deportations ramp up, there\u2019s now no watchdog, no accountability\u2014just unchecked power.Source: ProPublicaTrump Withdraws 11 ADA Guidance DocumentsWhat Happened: Trump has rescinded 11 federal guidance documents that helped businesses understand how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. These included COVID-era accommodations and practical tips for hotels, retailers, and hospitals to ensure accessibility.Why It Matters: Disability rights advocates warn the rollback signals a reduced federal commitment to ADA enforcement. Without clear guidance, compliance will now depend on businesses interpreting the law themselves\u2014raising the risk of lawsuits and inaccessible environments.

Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, has been detained since ICE arrested him last month at his campus housing.Why It Matters: Khalil\u2019s lawyers say the government has yet to present any proof supporting its removal case, raising due process concerns. With activists and legal observers watching closely, the judge\u2019s ruling on Friday could set a precedent in how Trump handles politically active immigrants.Source: ABC NewsTrump Revokes Legal Status for Migrants Who Entered U.S. via CBP One AppWhat Happened: Trump has ordered migrants who entered the U.S. through the Biden-era CBP One app to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 people entered legally since 2023 using the app, which was designed to provide orderly pathways into the U.S. and reduce illegal crossings. Parole status granted under Biden is being revoked, with termination notices urging recipients to self-deport via the rebranded CBP Home app.Why It Matters: By dismantling CBP One and TPS, the Trump regime is stripping protections from hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans\u2014forcing many into the shadows. Source: NBC NewsStudent Visas Are Being Revoked Without Reason or Warning, Colleges SayWhat Happened: At least 300 international student visas have been revoked suddenly and without explanation, according to multiple U.S. universities and the State Department. Schools such as Harvard, Columbia, and UC San Diego were not notified and only learned of the revocations through internal monitoring or immigration arrests.Why It Matters: Trump is revoking student visas without due process, using fear and vague excuses to punish dissent\u2014especially pro-Palestinian voices. It\u2019s authoritarian and puts over a million students\u2019 futures at risk.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchSocial Security wrongly told disabled people and some seniors their benefits ended, causing alarmWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration mistakenly told some recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 including disabled individuals and low-income seniors \u2014 that their benefits had been terminated. Benefit histories also disappeared from accounts before the issue was corrected a day later.Why It Matters: The glitch caused panic among vulnerable recipients who rely on SSI to survive. Lawmakers and experts blame the disruption on Musk, who has slashed SSA staff and systems. Advocates warn that such errors could become more common under current federal cuts.Source: CBS NewsNew Social Security Rules Will Create Hurdles for Millions of Seniors, Report FindsWhat Happened: Starting April 14, Americans will no longer be able to apply for retirement or survivor benefits by phone. Instead, they must apply online or travel to a Social Security office\u2014posing major burdens for millions, especially rural and elderly Americans. The policy also affects direct deposit changes, though Medicare and disability claims are exempt for now.Why It Matters: This rule change will burden millions of seniors and disabled Americans. Nearly 6 million could face 45-mile trips just to access benefits. Many lack internet or transportation\u2014and with jammed phone lines, shuttered offices, and month-long appointment delays, it effectively cuts them off from the support they desperately need.Source: NPRFor Arizona Residents\u2026 Arizona attorney general creates web portal to report Social Security disruptionsWhat Happened: Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes launched a new webpage for residents to report Social Security payment disruptions, citing growing concern over changes to the agency under Elon Musk\u2019s leadership.Go to azag.gov/socialsecurity.FDA Guts Training Division That Taught Opioid Safety and Drug Error PreventionWhat Happened: The FDA has eliminated its Division of Learning and Organizational Development, which trained staff and healthcare professionals on opioid safety, drug error prevention, and critical regulatory practices.

States like Arizona, Colorado, and Texas face growing waitlists, while others are hiking costs or slashing eligibility. Meanwhile, the Office of Child Care\u2014responsible for safety and accountability\u2014was gutted in recent federal layoffs.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s cuts are gutting a lifeline for working families. Parents will be forced to quit jobs or leave kids in unsafe care. Experts warn this is a reckless rollback that makes child care more expensive, more dangerous, and harder to access\u2014hitting working-class families the hardest and threatening the broader economy.Source: Associated PressRFK Jr.'s cuts to CDC lead poisoning team bring efforts to help tribes, health departments to a standstillWhat Happened: RFK Jr. purged the CDC\u2019s entire Lead Poisoning Prevention and Surveillance Branch. The decision halted ongoing efforts to respond to lead exposure in Milwaukee schools and an American Indian reservation.Why It Matters: The CDC\u2019s lead poisoning team was the only federal unit equipped for this work. Shuttering it with no replacement plan puts vulnerable children\u2014especially in tribal areas and cities like Milwaukee\u2014at serious risk.

Health officials are increasingly concerned about the spread into urban areas and day cares, particularly as many young children have not received their second MMR vaccine dose.Why It Matters: Experts warn the outbreak could stretch beyond a year and jeopardize the U.S.\u2019s measles elimination status. Undercounted cases, low vaccination rates, and gutted public health departments are fueling the crisis. Source: CNNRFK Jr. Claims Curve Is Flattening in Texas Measles Outbreak. Does the Data Agree?What Happened: RFK Jr. lied on social media that the Texas measles outbreak is \u201cflattening\u201d thanks to CDC reinforcements and vaccine distribution. But Texas state data tells a different story \u2014 infections are still rising and spreading into new counties.Why It Matters: Despite Kennedy\u2019s assurances, public health experts say the outbreak is far from under control. Kennedy is gaslighting the public while lives are in danger.Source: ABC NewsTrump to reportedly cut grant for key US steel project in Vance\u2019s hometownWhat Happened: Trump plans to cancel a $500 million grant for steel giant Cleveland-Cliffs in Middletown, Ohio\u2014JD Vance\u2019s hometown. The funds, part of a Biden-era clean energy initiative, were meant to modernize furnaces and create over 1,300 jobs.Why It Matters: The canceled grant was a lifeline for a struggling manufacturing town and a key step toward cleaner steel production.

Canadian veteran Todd Brayman has replaced every American product in his home, and apps like Maple Scan are helping others do the same by identifying and rejecting U.S.-made items.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade war is not just tanking markets\u2014it\u2019s destroying decades of alliances. The backlash is growing, and economic nationalism is eroding America\u2019s global partnerships. Our allies are now turning their backs on U.S. products, tourism, and diplomacy.Source: BBC NewsChina Calls JD Vance \"Ignorant and Impolite\" Over \"Peasants\" RemarkWhat Happened: China sharply rebuked Vance after he said the U.S. borrows money from \u201cChinese peasants\u201d to buy their manufactured goods, calling his comment \u201cignorant and impolite.\u201d Why It Matters: The remark adds diplomatic tension amid an escalating U.S.-China trade war. Trump's tariff policy is already triggering market volatility, and Vance\u2019s rhetoric risks further strains tensions.Source: CBS NewsWhat \u2018Special Relationship\u2019? U.S. Image Sours in Britain and EuropeWhat Happened: Recent polls in the U.K. and Germany show a steep decline in trust and support for the U.S. since the start of Trump\u2019s second term. British and European citizens are reacting negatively to Trump\u2019s global tariffs, anti-European rhetoric, alignment with Putin, and deportation policies. Protest actions have included Tesla vandalism and boycotts.Why It Matters: The collapse of transatlantic trust is a national security threat. Trump\u2019s actions are isolating the U.S., alienating key allies, and weakening decades long partnerships. If this continues, America risks standing alone in a world growing more hostile and unstable.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPentagon Considering Cutting 10,000 Troops From Europe, Alarming NATO AlliesWhat Happened: Trump is reviewing a proposal to withdraw up to 10,000 U.S. troops from Eastern Europe\u2014about half of those sent by Biden after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale genocidal invasion of Ukraine. Why It Matters: This is another gift to Putin. Pulling troops from Europe sends the message that the U.S. is stepping away from its NATO commitments. It undermines deterrence, weakens the alliance, and gives Moscow exactly what it wants\u2014less resistance on its borders.Source: NBC NewsTop Commander, in Potential Clash with Pentagon, Warns Against Europe Troop CutsWhat Happened: Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of U.S. European Command, publicly pushed back on a potential Trump plan to withdraw up to 10,000 troops from Europe. Cavoli told lawmakers he has \u201cconsistently recommended\u201d maintaining current force levels since Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, calling the presence vital for deterrence and stability.Why It Matters: Cavoli\u2019s testimony underscores rising friction between military leadership, congressional Republicans, and Trump. GOP defense hawks like Reps. Mike Rogers and Don Bacon warned the drawdown would empower Putin. Cavoli\u2019s public warning will most likely result in his dismissal.Source: PoliticoDonald Trump Jr. to visit Romania right before contentious electionWhat Happened: Donald Trump Jr. is set to visit Romania just six days before its rescheduled and highly contentious presidential election.

His defense of a pro-Russia candidate and planned visits show Trump is actively undermining democracy and backing authoritarian forces abroad\u2014helping Russia destabilize Europe from within.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f Supreme Court WatchSupreme Court Pauses Rehiring of 16,000 Fired Federal WorkersWhat Happened: The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that required Trump to reinstate 16,000 probationary federal employees fired under a mass dismissal initiative.Why It Matters: The ruling is a win for Trump amid legal challenges to its federal purges but another court order requiring reinstatements still stands\u2014potentially keeping the issue alive in other jurisdictions.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Says U.S. Will Impose Major Tariffs on Pharmaceutical ImportsWhat Happened: At a Republican fundraiser Tuesday, Trump announced the U.S. will soon roll out \u201cmajor\u201d tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, claiming the move will push drug manufacturers to relocate operations back to the U.S.Why It Matters: The proposed tariffs will disrupt global drug supply chains, raise medication costs, and deepen economic tensions\u2014especially as healthcare systems brace for more instability under Trump\u2019s trade war policies.Source: ReutersEU Slaps Tariffs on US Trucks, Cigarettes and Ice Cream to Target Trump\u2019s Red StatesWhat Happened: The European Union is hitting back at Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs by imposing up to 25% duties on around \u20ac22.1 billion ($23.9 billion) worth of U.S. exports \u2014 many of them from Republican strongholds. The tariffs, which include items like soybeans, white chocolate, orange juice, ice cream, and cigarettes from Florida, are designed to strike politically and economically at Trump\u2019s base.Why It Matters: The EU is hitting back hard\u2014and smart. By targeting exports from deep-red states, Brussels is using tariffs to apply political pressure where it hurts Trump most. Source: PoliticoUS Expected a Big Travel Year, But Overseas Visitors \u2014 Angered by Trump \u2014 Are Heading ElsewhereWhat Happened: International tourism to the U.S. plunged in March 2025\u2014down 11.6% overall, with a staggering 23% drop in travel from Mexico. Canadian bookings have fallen 40%, prompting Air Canada to slash flights. The downturn is due to Trump\u2019s hostile rhetoric, trade wars, immigration tactics, and diplomatic confrontations, including his public ambush of Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskyy.Why It Matters: This is a direct hit to the U.S. economy. The tourism industry supports millions of jobs, and sharp declines in international travel mean lost revenue for airlines, hotels, restaurants, and local economies. Trump\u2019s hostile posture is driving global visitors away \u2014 and businesses will pay the price.Source: Associated PressTiny country of Liechtenstein shocked by 37% tariffsWhat Happened: Trump slapped a 37% tariff on all imports from Liechtenstein \u2014 including power tools, dental implants, and electronic components \u2014 nearly double the rate on neighboring European countries.

The announcement triggered a fourth straight day of market losses, with the S&P 500 nearing bear market territory and $5.8 trillion in value wiped out since last week.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariff war is destabilizing global markets and straining U.S. alliances. This escalation with China signals a hardline, go-it-alone trade strategy that will disrupt global supply chains, drive up prices for American consumers, and leave the U.S. economically isolated.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News4/19- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501AP Wins Reinstatement to White House Events After Judge Rules Government Can\u2019t Bar Its JournalistsWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered Trump to restore The Associated Press\u2019s access to White House events after the outlet was banned for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The judge ruled the ban violated the First Amendment, affirming the government can\u2019t retaliate against press outlets over language or viewpoint.Source: Associated PressNational Park Service Restores Original Harriet Tubman, Underground Railroad WebpageWhat Happened: After news reports revealed unauthorized edits to the National Park Service\u2019s Harriet Tubman and Underground Railroad webpage\u2014including the removal of Tubman\u2019s photo and whitewashing slavery\u2014the NPS has reversed the changes.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says enforcement will now focus only on fraud or crypto used for crimes like trafficking or terrorism.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> The move is part of Trump\u2019s broader deregulatory push to boost the crypto industry\u2014regardless of rising fraud and money laundering. Trump is gutting accountability as crypto scams are exploding. Meanwhile, Trump and his family continue deepening their own crypto ventures, highlighting conflicts of interest and self-enrichment.</span></p><p><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-crypto-enforcement-trump-blanche-265c91c32e5fab22fb09ba8449a0aec6\" rel=\"\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>Mar-a-Lago to Get $1.8 Million in Taxpayer-Funded Security Upgrades While Trump Slashes Public Spending</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7mar-a-lago-to-get-million-in-taxpayer-funded-security-upgrades-while-trump-slashes-public-spending\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/160863988/mar-a-lago-to-get-million-in-taxpayer-funded-security-upgrades-while-trump-slashes-public-spending\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Trump approved $1.82 million in taxpayer-funded \u201csecurity enhancements\u201d at Mar-a-Lago.

Crypto Enforcement Unit</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Justice Department will immediately disband its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team, ending efforts to prosecute complex crypto-related crimes involving financial regulations. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says enforcement will now focus only on fraud or crypto used for crimes like trafficking or terrorism.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move is part of Trump\\u2019s broader deregulatory push to boost the crypto industry\\u2014regardless of rising fraud and money laundering. Trump is gutting accountability as crypto scams are exploding. Meanwhile, Trump and his family continue deepening their own crypto ventures, highlighting conflicts of interest and self-enrichment.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-crypto-enforcement-trump-blanche-265c91c32e5fab22fb09ba8449a0aec6\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Mar-a-Lago to Get $1.8 Million in Taxpayer-Funded Security Upgrades While Trump Slashes Public Spending</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump approved $1.82 million in taxpayer-funded \\u201Csecurity enhancements\\u201D at Mar-a-Lago.
