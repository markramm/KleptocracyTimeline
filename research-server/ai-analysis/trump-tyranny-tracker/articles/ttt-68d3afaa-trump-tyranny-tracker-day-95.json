Warren, file)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 24Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsThe Real Winners of the Trump Memecoin Feeding FrenzyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s team announced a May 22 dinner for the top 220 $TRUMP coinholders, triggering a 60% price spike within an hour. Trump-linked firms CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC\u2014who own 80% of the coin\u2014profited most, collecting major transaction fees from the surge.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just crypto\u2014it\u2019s corruption. Trump\u2019s team engineered a price spike to cash in on hype and access, raking in $1.6 million in fees in 24 hours. It\u2019s a pay-to-play scheme disguised as a meme coin, funneling money straight to insiders.Source: WIREDHow Trump team turned a dinner invite into a crypto boon worth millionsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s team offered an \u201cintimate private dinner\u201d at Trump National Golf Club to the top 220 holders of his $TRUMP meme coin. The promo sparked a $100 million buying frenzy across 27 wallets\u2014one buyer alone spent $24 million. The dinner is scheduled for May 22.Why It Matters: Trump has turned crypto into a pay-to-play scheme\u2014selling political access for cash. His cronies control 80% of the coin and have already raked in $41 million in fees. One top buyer is linked to a Chinese exchange run by a man under a U.S. fraud investigation, which Trump put on hold. Also, we don\u2019t know what foreign governments are buying Trump.Source: Washington PostIndicted \u2018Bitcoin Jesus\u2019 Pays Roger Stone $600,000 to Lobby for HimWhat Happened: Roger Stone, longtime Trump ally, is being paid $600,000 by crypto investor Roger Ver, known as \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d to lobby Congress. Ver is facing federal tax fraud charges for allegedly hiding $48 million in crypto assets after renouncing U.S. citizenship. Stone is pushing to repeal the tax laws that Ver was charged with.Why It Matters: This case exposes how Trump-world is cashing in on crypto while gutting oversight. Roger Ver, charged with tax fraud, is paying Trump ally Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby for him\u2014turning legal trouble into influence-buying. Source: New York TimesA Side Hustle for Musk Insiders: Selling Access to SpaceX and xAI SharesWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s inner circle is quietly profiting by selling access to private shares in Musk\u2019s companies\u2014like SpaceX and xAI\u2014through exclusive shell companies and special-purpose vehicles. One example: Musk ally Antonio Gracias recently offered $1B in shares, raking in millions in fees.Why It Matters: These deals let Musk\u2019s inner circle profit massively while keeping SpaceX shielded from public scrutiny. By using shell companies and private offerings, they bypass transparency rules, centralize control, and turn access into profit\u2014all without answering to the public, regulators, or shareholders.Source: Wall Street JournalMeet the top donors to Trump\u2019s $239 million inauguration fundWhat Happened: Trump raised a record-breaking $239 million for his 2025 inauguration. The top donors included crypto companies, tech giants, and over a dozen individuals Trump has since nominated for ambassadorships and Cabinet positions.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s $239M inauguration fund is blatant pay-to-play corruption.

Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s executive order could disenfranchise millions\u2014particularly Native Americans and naturalized citizens\u2014by imposing new proof-of-citizenship requirements and limiting accepted ballots. It's based on his lies of widespread voter fraud, which have been repeatedly debunked. Election officials warn it\u2019s a sweeping, likely unconstitutional attempt to suppress votes through executive power.Source: Associated PressWho Is DOGE? The Metaphysical Mystery of Trump\u2019s Shadow GovernmentWhat Happened: At a recent meeting, acting GSA Administrator Stephen Ehikian denied that Musk operatives were working inside the agency\u2014despite reports that an entire floor is dedicated to unauthorized DOGE and several Musk operatives are on the payroll. Unauthorized DOGE is operating as a shadow network embedded across government agencies.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s shadow network merges federal power with his companies\u2014blurring lines between government service and corporate control. With secret clearances and expanding access to sensitive systems, it\u2019s become a surveillance machine.

From mass purges of federal workers to dismantling climate research and DEI programs, the plan is being implemented at breathtaking speed.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t policy\u2014it\u2019s a hostile takeover. Trump is using Project 2025 to replace democracy with Christian nationalism, dismantle education, purge civil servants, erase climate science, and impose far-right rule.

The move follows similar actions targeting law firms, former intel officials, and other political opponents.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal agencies to choke off funding for his political opponents\u2014mirroring authoritarian tactics used in Russia to crush dissent.

Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s memo weaponizes the Justice Department to intimidate doctors, using fear and legal threats to deter care for trans youth\u2014even where it remains legal.

It also moves to dismantle parts of the Civil Rights Act itself.Source: Washington PostDoes the Civil Rights Act Protect or, as Trump Says, Promote Favoritism?What Happened: Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies to stop enforcing key provisions of the Civil Rights Act, claiming the law promotes \u201crace- or sex-based favoritism\u201d and must be refocused on \u201cindividual merit\u201d and \u201ccolorblind\u201d principles.Why It Matters: This move guts civil rights enforcement without repealing the law\u2014undermining protections for marginalized communities and empowering discrimination under the guise of \u201cneutrality.\u201d Source: USA TODAYPam Bondi Cuts \u201cWasteful\u201d Funds to Support Victims of Violent CrimeWhat Happened: Pam Bondi canceled hundreds of DOJ grants\u2014worth over $800 million\u2014including funds for domestic violence and sexual assault support services. While Bondi claims services won't be affected, critical programs for survivors, including hotlines and legal resources, are being defunded.Why It Matters: These cuts dismantle vital support systems for women, LGBTQ, and children, directly contradicting Trump\u2019s claims to protect victims of crime. The selective reinstatement of only pet-friendly shelter grants underscores Trump\u2019s warped priorities.Source: Mother JonesLargest Federal Employee Union, a Leading Trump Opponent, to Lay Off More Than Half of StaffWhat Happened: The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, announced it will lay off more than half its staff\u2014reducing its workforce from 355 to about 150\u2014after a financial crisis triggered by Trump\u2019s executive orders stripped union rights from hundreds of thousands of federal workers.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on organized resistance inside the federal government. AFGE has been one of the strongest forces pushing back against Trump\u2019s authoritarian purge\u2014and now it\u2019s being gutted. The layoffs weaken labor protections and clear the path for Musk to reshape the government.Source: Associated PressTrump Asks Supreme Court to Reinstate Ban on Transgender TroopsWhat Happened: Trump asked the Supreme Court to allow its ban on transgender military service members while lower court challenges are ongoing. Federal judges in Washington state and D.C. have blocked the policy, citing a lack of evidence that it harms military readiness.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader attack on LGBTQ+ rights. Banning transgender troops isn\u2019t about readiness\u2014it\u2019s about discrimination. If upheld, it would sideline qualified Americans solely based on gender identity, undermining equality in military service.Source: USA TODAYRFK Jr. Wants an Autism \u2018Registry.\u2019 People Are PissedWhat Happened: RFK Jr. is launching a controversial autism \u201cregistry\u201d using private health data to track environmental links to autism\u2014while dismissing genetic research. The move has drawn intense backlash, especially after Kennedy made inflammatory remarks about autistic people.Why It Matters: Autistic individuals, families, and experts warn this approach is dehumanizing, medically reckless, and rooted in outdated thinking.

Internal messages reveal unsafe conditions, with staff afraid to speak out. Reports cite lack of food, water, medical care, and potential violations of federal laws meant to protect against prison rape.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration crackdown has pushed federal detention facilities to the brink, leading to inhumane conditions and the suspension of key oversight bodies. Basic civil and human rights in the U.S. are being eroded.Source: Associated PressVenezuelans Subject to Wartime Deportation Given Just 12 Hours to Contest Removal, Docs ShowWhat Happened: Migrants facing deportation under the Alien Enemies Act are given only 12 hours to declare whether they want to fight their removal, according to newly unsealed court documents. Why It Matters: Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, say the timeline violates the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement that detainees receive a \u201creasonable\u201d period to appeal. The form provided is in English only, doesn\u2019t explicitly inform detainees of their right to challenge deportation, and fails to ensure meaningful access to legal counsel.Source: Associated PressICE Agents Arrested Mahmoud Khalil Without a Warrant, Trump Officials ConfirmsWhat Happened: Trump admitted that ICE agents arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil without a warrant, citing \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d Khalil, a Syrian-born U.S. green card holder, was taken into custody outside his NYC apartment and has been detained in Louisiana since.Why It Matters: Advocacy groups argue that Trump is violating First Amendment rights by targeting individuals for their political views and denying due process.Source: CBS NewsTufts Student R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Must Be Moved to Vermont, Judge RulesWhat Happened: A federal judge rejected the Justice Department\u2019s request to delay the return of R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, to Vermont. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was arrested by ICE after co-authoring an op-ed about Israel and Gaza.

Why It Matters: The judge ruled \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s detention violated due process, highlighting concerns that Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is targeting political speech.

Rashida Tlaib. Many were held for days without legal counsel in a CBP office not intended for long-term detention.Why It Matters: The detentions, mostly of immigrants without legal status, reveal a pattern of harsh enforcement at a poorly marked border crossing.

The line bypassed Department of Defense security systems and allowed him to connect directly to the public internet without standard protections.Why It Matters: This unprecedented breach of Pentagon protocol potentially exposed sensitive defense operations to hacking or surveillance by adversaries such as Russia and China. The move also likely violated recordkeeping laws and raises national security concerns, especially given Hegseth\u2019s recent unauthorized sharing of strike details in Signal chats.

Staff were purged without standard exit protocols, and the NSC has been sidelined from major foreign policy decisions. National security adviser Michael Waltz has lost control as Trump increasingly empowers Stephen Miller and outside ideologues.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just dysfunction\u2014it\u2019s deliberate sabotage of America\u2019s national security infrastructure. Trump continues replacing expertise with ideological purity tests, bypassing legal oversight, and turning the NSC into a loyalty club.

Grants already in use were terminated, leaving many organizations scrambling.Why It Matters: Victim hotlines, trauma centers, domestic violence shelters, and community safety initiatives are facing shutdowns. Experts say the move abandons victims mid-crisis and prioritizes Trump\u2019s political agenda over public safety.Source: CNNTrump\u2019s First-Term NSF Pick Resigns Amid Cuts to Science and DEI ResearchWhat Happened: Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the National Science Foundation, has resigned, citing an inability to continue advancing the agency\u2019s mission under Trump\u2019s cuts. His departure follows NSF\u2019s cancellation of over $230 million in grants, including research on racial equity, DEI in STEM, vaccine information, and disinformation.Why It Matters: Panchanathan\u2019s resignation reiterates a collapse in trust between the scientific community and Trump\u2019s regime. With DEI banned, disinformation research defunded, and Musk purging staff, the NSF is essentially gutted. Science is no longer guided by evidence but by ideology.Source: CNNTrump Cuts Threaten Agency Running Meals on WheelsWhat Happened: Trump is dismantling the small federal agency overseeing programs like Meals on Wheels and services for older and disabled Americans.

Eliminating it would cripple America\u2019s ability to predict climate risks, weakening infrastructure planning, national security, and scientific leadership globally. Experts warn it would set climate science back to 1950s-era capabilities.Source: ProPublicaTrump Denies Aid for Arkansas After Storms That Killed More Than 40 PeopleWhat Happened: Trump denied federal disaster relief to Arkansas following deadly tornadoes and storms in March that killed over 40 people across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri. Despite a formal request from Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and appeals from Arkansas lawmakers, Trump rejected the aid.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting FEMA just as climate disasters are worsening.

Intelligence and satellite data confirm North Korea has supplied Russia with over 4 million artillery shells, 148 ballistic missiles, and thousands of troops\u2014reiterating that Kim Jong-un is a key military partner in Russia\u2019s genocidal war.Why It Matters: North Korea has been arming Russia\u2019s war machine\u2014with up to 70% of its artillery coming from Pyongyang. In return, Putin is likely handing over advanced tech, boosting North Korea\u2019s military power, and raising the stakes for regional and global security.Source: The GuardianIran Rejects U.S. Demand to Import Nuclear Fuel OnlyWhat Happened: Iran rejected a U.S. proposal to rely on imported uranium, insisting on its right to enrich fuel under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The clash came during nuclear talks in Oman, with Iran calling the U.S. plan \u201cimpractical and illogical.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a major roadblock to preventing Iran from going nuclear.

Trump-linked firms CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC\\u2014who own 80% of the coin\\u2014profited most, collecting major transaction fees from the surge.</p><p>Why It Matters: This isn\\u2019t just crypto\\u2014it\\u2019s corruption. Trump\\u2019s team engineered a price spike to cash in on hype and access, raking in $1.6 million in fees in 24 hours.

The promo sparked a $100 million buying frenzy across 27 wallets\\u2014one buyer alone spent $24 million. The dinner is scheduled for May 22.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump has turned crypto into a pay-to-play scheme\\u2014selling political access for cash. His cronies control 80% of the coin and have already raked in $41 million in fees. One top buyer is linked to a Chinese exchange run by a man under a U.S. fraud investigation, which Trump put on hold.

One example: Musk ally Antonio Gracias recently offered $1B in shares, raking in millions in fees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These deals let Musk\\u2019s inner circle profit massively while keeping SpaceX shielded from public scrutiny.

Unauthorized DOGE is operating as a shadow network embedded across government agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s shadow network merges federal power with his companies\\u2014blurring lines between government service and corporate control.
