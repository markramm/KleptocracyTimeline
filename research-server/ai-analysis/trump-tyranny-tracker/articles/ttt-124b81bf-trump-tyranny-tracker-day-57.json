(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 17Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Donor Profits from Fast-Tracked Pipeline Deal Amid Corruption AllegationsWhat Happened: Trump is facing accusations of a quid pro quo after fast-tracking the controversial Line 5 pipeline project in Michigan, which is partly contracted to Barnard Construction\u2014a company owned by major Trump donor Tim Barnard.Why It Matters: Barnard and his wife donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and have given millions to Republican officials. His company, which received over $1 billion for border wall construction under Trump, has a history of wage violations and questionable bidding practices. Source: The GuardianPutin Approves U.S. Hedge Fund\u2019s Russian Investment Ahead of Trump TalksWhat Happened: Putin authorized U.S.-based 683 Capital Partners LP to buy Russian securities, bypassing his 2022 ban on \u201cunfriendly\u201d foreign investors. The move comes a day before Trump\u2019s call with Putin, where they will discuss Ukraine and asset divisions.Why It Matters: The timing raises concerns about Trump\u2019s economic alignment with Russia, especially as reports suggest U.S.-Russia talks on energy cooperation with sanctioned Gazprom. Source: The Moscow TimesTrump\u2019s Crypto Project Raises $550 Million Amid Conflict of Interest ConcernsWhat Happened: World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture backed by Trump\u2019s family, announced it raised $250 million in its second token sale, bringing total sales to $550 million. The project, launched in October, allows the Trump family to take home 75% of net revenue. WLFI\u2019s backers include crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is negotiating a fraud case with the SEC.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crypto policies blatantly serve his family\u2019s financial interests. The SEC conveniently eased rules on meme coins right as Trump and Melania launched their tokens\u2014a glaring conflict of interest and corruption at the highest levels.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Escalates Authoritarian Fight Against Federal Courts Over Deportation PowersWhat Happened: Trump is openly defying judicial authority, seeking to remove a federal judge who blocked its mass deportations under a rarely used wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act. After Judge James Boasberg ordered deportation flights turned around, Trump officials ignored the ruling and argued the judge had no authority over flights outside U.S. airspace. Attorney General Pam Bondi called the judge\u2019s order an \u201cintrusion\u201d on Trump\u2019s power, while DOJ lawyers accused the court of \u201cmicromanagement.\u201dWhy It Matters: This marks a severe authoritarian escalation, with Trump testing the limits of unchecked executive power. The judiciary remains the last check on this regime\u2019s extreme moves, but Trump\u2019s blatant defiance signals a dangerous break from constitutional norms.Source: The Washington PostTrump-Backed Push for Constitutional Convention Raises Fears of Expanding Presidential PowerWhat Happened: A legal push backed by Trump allies aims to force a constitutional convention by counting outdated state petitions, some from as far back as 1789. Proponents claim the 34-state threshold was met in 1979, ignoring rescinded petitions. While framed as a debt-limit measure, it could expand presidential power, weaken oversight, and even pave the way for a Trump third term.Why It Matters: A constitutional convention has never been held in U.S. history, and legal experts warn it could spiral beyond its stated purpose, potentially rewriting the Constitution itself. Trump allies are using dubious legal reasoning to justify the effort, raising concerns about an authoritarian power grab under the guise of fiscal responsibility.Source: ProPublicaProject 2025 Architect Celebrates Trump\u2019s AgendaWhat Happened: Paul Dans, former head of Project 2025, confirms Trump is implementing much of the radical agenda he helped design\u2014despite Trump lying about it during the campaign. The plan includes dismantling federal agencies, banning abortion, and eliminating LGBTQ+ rights. Dans credits Trump\u2019s leadership and Musk\u2019s role in reshaping the government.Why It Matters: This confirms Project 2025 was always Trump\u2019s blueprint for authoritarian rule. Dans and his allies push the \"unitary executive\" theory, arguing Trump should have unchecked power.Source: PoliticoTrump Expands Crackdown in Big LawWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is targeting 20 major U.S. law firms over their \u201cDEI practices,\u201d questioning their legality under federal civil rights laws.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t about DEI\u2014it\u2019s about crushing dissent. Trump\u2019s regime is using DEI as a pretext to silence law firms like Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss, intimidate them from taking cases against his regime, and weaponize federal power to punish political opponents.Source: The Wall Street JournalDOGE Breaks Into U.S. Institute of PeaceWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s operatives forcibly entered the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) in D.C., despite its independent status. USIP CEO George Moose said \u201cDOGE has broken into our building,\u201d prompting police intervention.Why It Matters: This authoritarian-style takeover sets a dangerous precedent, with Musk\u2019s operatives using force to seize control of institutions. The regime\u2019s escalating attacks on independent agencies mirror tactics used in dictatorships, where violence replaces the rule of law.Source: NBC Washington\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Lays Groundwork for Investigating People Pardoned by BidenWhat Happened: Trump is questioning the validity of pardons issued by Joe Biden, claiming they were improperly signed using an autopen and may be \u201cvoid.\u201d He argues Biden was unaware of the decisions and suggests those who facilitated the process \u201cmay have committed a crime.\u201dWhy It Matters: The signals a potential effort to investigate and prosecute individuals pardoned by Biden, including January 6th committee members; former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Source: The Wall Street JournalHoman on Deportation Flights: \u2018I Don\u2019t Care What the Judges Think\u2019What Happened: Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, dismissed a court order blocking deportation flights, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care what the judges think.\u201d Why It Matters: The regime is openly defying the judiciary, eroding checks and balances, and pushing authoritarian rule by expanding unchecked deportation powers.Source: The HillTrump Erases Gun Violence as Public Health IssueWhat Happened: Trump removed an advisory by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that labeled gun violence a public health crisis from the HHS website, citing an executive order to protect Second Amendment rights.Why It Matters: The move undermines research and prevention efforts, erasing data on firearm suicides, homicides, and community impact. It\u2019s part of a broader purge of federal information.Source: The GuardianTrump appoints Charlie Kirk, Walt Nauta, Michael Flynn to military boardsWhat Happened: Trump appointed extremist loyalists to the boards of visitors overseeing U.S. military academies. His appointees include Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI; Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s aide indicted in the classified documents case; and Charlie Kirk, a far-right activist with no military experience. Other appointees include Steve Bannon\u2019s daughter, Sean Spicer, and Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who previously blocked military promotions in protest of Pentagon policies.Why It Matters: This mirrors authoritarian tactics of installing unqualified loyalists in key positions, undermining military independence and academic integrity. These boards oversee morale, finances, and curriculum at West Point, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy. This is a blatant power grab to politicize the military and erode its institutional integrity.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Moves to Remove Judge Who Questioned DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump deported over 200 Venezuelans despite a judge\u2019s order blocking the move under the Alien Enemies Act. Now, the Justice Department is trying to remove U.S. District Judge James Boasberg from the case after he demanded an explanation and details of the deportees.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on judicial independence. Trump is pushing executive power to the extreme\u2014ignoring court orders and now trying to eliminate judges who challenge him\u2014a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: ReutersTrump DOJ Defends Ignoring Judge\u2019s Order, Claims Oral Ruling Was \"Not Enforceable\"What Happened: Trump is defending its decision to carry out deportations despite a federal judge\u2019s order to halt them. The DOJ argued that an oral ruling from the bench is \u201cnot enforceable,\u201d insisting only a written order matters. The judge had directed planes carrying deported migrants to turn back, but Trump ignored it.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on judicial independence. Trump is pushing executive power to the extreme\u2014ignoring court orders and now trying to rewrite the rules of law\u2014a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: CNNBrown University Warns International Students and Staff Against Foreign TravelWhat Happened: Brown University advises international students, staff, and faculty\u2014including visa holders and green card holders\u2014to reconsider traveling abroad after Trump deported a Brown medical professor despite a court order blocking her removal. The warning comes as Brown students prepare for spring break and amid escalating immigration crackdowns targeting academics and activists.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration purge is now targeting elite universities, weaponizing deportation against legal residents and visa holders\u2014even ignoring court rulings to do it. International scholars are afraid, universities are issuing travel warnings, and foreign governments will follow. Source: The HillTrump\u2019s Kennedy Center Takeover What Happened: Trump led a Kennedy Center board meeting, pushing to reshape the Honors with conservative-leaning honorees and personally host the event. He suggested figures like Sylvester Stallone, Elvis Presley, and Babe Ruth (despite no posthumous awards) and slammed past honorees as \u201cradical left lunatics.\u201d He also proposed auctioning broadcast rights, threatening to turn the event into a partisan spectacle.Why It Matters: Trump is turning the Kennedy Center into a state-controlled propaganda tool, just like Putin\u2019s grip on Russian culture. Staff have been purged, artists canceled, and funding threatened\u2014all to replace independent voices with Trump loyalists. This isn\u2019t about the arts; it\u2019s about politicizing culture and enforcing ideological purity in America\u2019s premier cultural institution.Source: The Washington PostTrump Deploys Navy Destroyer to Southern Border in Unprecedented MoveWhat Happened: The Pentagon announced the deployment of the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, to assist with \u201csecuring\u201d the U.S.-Mexico border. The warship, typically used for combat operations, will patrol U.S. and international waters with a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment on board. Why It Matters: Deploying a Navy warship\u2014armed with Tomahawk missiles\u2014for border control is an unprecedented escalation with no practical purpose beyond political theater. The move highlights Trump\u2019s authoritarian militarization of domestic policy, using high-cost military assets for a propaganda stunt rather than real security needs.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE Strips, Interrogates, and Detains N.H. Green Card Holder Without ExplanationWhat Happened: Fabian Schmidt, a New Hampshire green card holder, was violently interrogated by ICE at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport, stripped naked, denied food and medication, and pressured to relinquish his legal status. He was later hospitalized with the flu and remains detained without explanation. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration purge is targeting legal residents, violating court orders, and employing brutal detention tactics. The regime is escalating its war on immigrants, using intimidation and abuse to strip people of their legal status and force deportations.Source: New York Daily NewsICE Violated Rights of 22 People, Created Warrants After Arrests, Lawyers SayWhat Happened: Federal immigration agents in Chicago arrested individuals without proper warrants, including a U.S. citizen, and created warrants after arrests to justify their actions, according to a federal court filing. Attorneys argue this violates federal law, constitutional rights, and the Nava Settlement, which limits ICE\u2019s ability to make warrantless arrestsWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine is now illegally detaining U.S. citizens\u2014with ICE fabricating paperwork to bypass legal protections. Even more alarming, they didn\u2019t document the arrest, a hallmark of authoritarian regimes where people disappear without a record. This isn\u2019t just an immigration crackdown; it\u2019s a blatant assault on constitutional rights and due process.Source: Chicago Sun Times, Aura Bogado on BlueskyEducation Department staff cuts could limit options for families of kids with disabilitiesWhat Happened: The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates discrimination cases for kids with disabilities, has been slashed in half. More than 20,000 cases were frozen for weeks, and now the department is prioritizing antisemitism cases, leaving disability complaints in limbo. Why It Matters: Families already struggling to get services for their children now face even fewer options. With fewer investigators, discrimination cases will pile up, making it even harder for kids with disabilities to get the education they\u2019re legally entitled to.Source: Associated PressDOD Leadership Firings Raise Alarm Over Support for Female OfficersWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return, his regime has purged nearly all top female military officers, leaving no women in four-star leadership positions. The dismissals, including Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, have sparked outrage among veterans and service members, highlighting Trump\u2019s sidelining of women in the military.Why It Matters: These firings are a rollback of progress for female military leadership, undermining morale and sending a clear message that experience and qualifications take a backseat to extremist political agenda. Source: Military TimesTrump Revives Family Detention in Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: Trump has reopened two family detention centers in South Texas, reversing Biden-era policies and escalating its immigration crackdown. The facilities, operated by private prison companies, are already detaining families\u2014including those with deep U.S. ties.Why It Matters: Trump is bringing back family detention\u2014a policy condemned for its inhumanity, legal violations, and history of abuse and neglect. This is about instilling fear, not enforcing the law. His regime is also gearing up to challenge legal limits on detaining migrant children, paving the way for prolonged incarceration of families in a direct assault on human rights.Source: The New York TimesTexas midwife arrested for allegedly providing abortions amid state\u2019s near-total banWhat Happened: Texas authorities arrested midwife Maria Margarita Rojas, charging her with illegally performing abortions and practicing medicine without a license. If convicted, she faces decades in prison under the state's near-total abortion ban.Why It Matters: This is Texas\u2019s first criminal arrest under its extreme abortion ban, marking a new level of enforcement. This is a blatant assault on women\u2019s rights, using the law to criminalize reproductive care.Source: The GuardianICE Accused of Violating Chicago Agreement in Immigration RaidsWhat Happened: Activists and attorneys allege that ICE violated a 2022 agreement on \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d during recent immigration raids in Chicago and surrounding states. The National Immigrant Justice Center filed a federal complaint detailing violations, including the arrest of a U.S. citizen and individuals with no criminal records.Why It Matters: The agreement, which covers Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, was designed to prevent warrantless arrests unless an individual was likely to escape. The raids have left families struggling\u2014one detained man\u2019s wife is battling cancer, and another was mistakenly arrested.Source: The GuardianTrump Targets Immigrants Who Entered Legally Under Biden\u2019s ProgramWhat Happened: Immigrants who entered the U.S. legally under Biden\u2019s \u201chumanitarian parole\u201d program are now being stripped of their status and targeted for deportation. The regime is using personal details to identify them for removal.Why It Matters: Trump is ripping away legal status from refugees who built lives in the U.S. under Biden, including those from Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, and Ukraine. This isn\u2019t just cruel\u2014it destroys trust in U.S. immigration policies and shows blatant disregard for fairness and due process.Source: The Wall Street JournalPentagon Erases Iwo Jima Flag-Raiser and Code Talkers in DEI PurgeWhat Happened: The Pentagon has removed webpages honoring Pfc. Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima, and Navajo Code Talkers, whose unbreakable language helped win WWII. Other pages about minority, female, and LGBTQ+ service members were also deleted.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian attempt to erase and rewrite history, targeting American war heroes simply because they were minorities. The Pentagon is actively rewriting the past, using Trump\u2019s \u201cDEI\u201d purge as cover to whitewash military contributions from non-white troops.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchProposal would force millions to file Social Security claims in personWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration plans to force millions of elderly and disabled Americans to verify their identity in person instead of over the phone. This is as Musk slashes staff and shuts down offices.Why It Matters: This exposes Trump\u2019s lies about protecting Social Security while creating massive delays for millions of seniors who depend on it. With offices shutting down, seniors and disabled Americans will have to travel absurd distances to verify their identity, worsening an already crippled system.Source: The Washington PostDOGE Cuts Reach Key Nuclear Scientists, Bomb Engineers and Safety ExpertsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass firings at the National Nuclear Security Administration  have gutted critical staff overseeing America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. More than 130 top scientists, engineers, and security experts were forced out, jeopardizing nuclear modernization efforts and safety protocols.Why It Matters: The cuts weaken oversight of the U.S. nuclear stockpile and increase risks of security failures. Trump and Musk\u2019s reckless purge is undermining national security at a time of global instability.Source: The New York TimesTrump Moves to Eliminate EPA\u2019s Scientific Research ArmWhat Happened: Trump plans to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Research and Development, potentially laying off 1,155 scientists, chemists, and toxicologists. This is part of a broader 65% budget cut to the EPA, which would cripple clean water initiatives, air quality monitoring, and toxic site cleanups.Why It Matters: The will weaken environmental protections, making it harder for the EPA to enforce science-based regulations. This is a deliberate effort to erase federal environmental oversight and favor polluting industries. Source: The New York TimesSocial Security Employees Warn of Damage From DOGEWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are slashing 12% of the Social Security Administration\u2019s workforce, offering buyouts to thousands. Employees warn the cuts will cripple customer service, delay payments, and destabilize a system already running on outdated infrastructure.Why It Matters: Social Security keeps millions of seniors and disabled out of poverty, but Musk and Trump are laying the groundwork to gut the agency, risking total system failure. Source: The New York TimesTrump Halts Agent Orange Cleanup in Vietnam, Risking Public Health CrisisWhat Happened: Trump halted USAID\u2019s cleanup of toxic dioxin contamination at Vietnam\u2019s Bien Hoa air base, leaving exposed pits of poisoned soil at risk of washing into nearby communities during the rainy season. The cleanup\u2014part of a $430 million U.S. commitment\u2014was suspended under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s foreign aid freeze, forcing workers to abandon the site and jeopardizing relations with Vietnam, a key strategic partner.Why It Matters: The halt endangers hundreds of thousands of people, as dioxin from Agent Orange can contaminate water and food supplies, causing severe health issues. U.S. diplomats and experts warn that stopping mid-cleanup is worse than never starting. Source: ProPublicaDOGE\u2019s USDA Cuts Threaten Food Supply and PricesWhat Happened: Trump and Musk\u2019s mass firings at the USDA have crippled food inspections, stalled imports, and weakened invasive species detection. Ports are overwhelmed, food is rotting, and judges\u2019 reinstatement orders are being ignored.Why It Matters: Grocery prices will rise, food shortages will worsen, and invasive pests will devastate U.S. agriculture. This isn\u2019t about efficiency\u2014it\u2019s about dismantling government at public expense.Source: WIREDNOAA\u2019s Storm Prediction Center Targeted in DOGE CutsWhat Happened: Despite deadly storms over the weekend, Musk has listed NOAA\u2019s Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma among planned office closures. The SPC provides critical tornado and severe weather forecasts nationwide.Why It Matters: The center warned of last weekend\u2019s deadly storms days in advance. Without it, emergency responders and residents will lose crucial early warnings. Republican Rep. Tom Cole claims to have intervened to save the facility, but DOGE still lists it for closure.Source: ABC News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchMacron to EU: Stop Buying American Weapons, Choose European DefenseWhat Happened: French President Emmanuel Macron urged EU countries to ditch American-made defense equipment in favor of European alternatives. He called on nations purchasing U.S. Patriot missile systems to opt for the Franco-Italian SAMP/T and those buying F-35s to consider the Rafale fighter jet. Why It Matters: Trump's egregious foreign policy and coziness with Russia are pushing Europe to reduce reliance on U.S. military support. Macron\u2019s push for EU defense autonomy challenges American dominance in the European arms market. Source: Politico\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Weighs Recognizing Crimea as Russian Territory in Bid to End WarWhat Happened: Trump is considering illegally recognizing Crimea as Russian \u201cterritory,\u201d fully aligning with Putin\u2019s demands. Reports indicate U.S. officials will pressure the U.N. to do the same. This comes ahead of Trump\u2019s Tuesday call with Putin, where a 30-day \"ceasefire\" and asset division are set to be discussed\u2014pushing Ukraine toward surrender to appease Moscow.Why It Matters: If Trump recognizes Crimea as \u201cRussian,\u201d he would be endorsing Russia\u2019s genocide, war crimes, and illegal land grabs, rewarding aggression while abandoning Ukraine. This would violate international law and directly undermine global efforts to oppose Putin\u2019s illegal occupation, genocidal aggression, and imperialist expansionist goals.Source: SemaforTulsi Gabbard Echoes Kremlin Line, Calls Trump\u2019s Ukraine Talks \u201cUnprecedented Progress\u201dWhat Happened: U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard defended Trump\u2019s negotiations with Russia, claiming he is \u201cfocused on peace\u201d and has achieved more progress than past administrations. She emphasized the \"strong partnership\" between the U.S. and Russia, calling Trump and Putin \u201cvery good friends\u201d with \u201cshared objectives\u201d on security and prosperity.Why It Matters: Gabbard, long accused of parroting Kremlin propaganda, is now using her role as DNI to push pro-Russia narratives while shaping U.S. intelligence to fit Trump\u2019s agenda. Calling Trump\u2019s Ukraine betrayal a \"breakthrough\" mirrors Moscow\u2019s spin, while her focus on Islamist threats is a deliberate distraction from Trump\u2019s fealty to Putin.Source: NDTVTrump\u2019s Antisemitism Chief Shares Post from Neo-Nazi LeaderWhat Happened: Leo Terrell, head of Trump\u2019s official antisemitism task force, shared a post by Patrick Casey, a former leader of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa. The post referenced Trump\u2019s claim that Sen. Chuck Schumer \u201cused to be Jewish\u201d and is now \u201cPalestinian.\u201d Casey added that Trump \u201chas the ability to revoke someone\u2019s Jew card.\u201dWhy It Matters: Jewish leaders condemned Terrell\u2019s actions, calling it evidence that Trump\u2019s regime is using antisemitism for political gain rather than combatting it.

His statement follows new U.S. airstrikes against the Houthis, with Defense Secretary Hegseth vowing an \u201cunrelenting\u201d military campaign until the group stops its attacks.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating tensions with Iran, reviving his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy to crush its economy while keeping \u201call options on the table.\u201d The risk of broader regional conflict is rising, with potential global consequences for energy markets and security.Source: CNBCTrump\u2019s Tariff Hikes to Slow Global Growth, Increase InflationWhat Happened: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Trump\u2019s tariff hikes will slow global economic growth and drive up inflation. The U.S. will see slower expansion, with GDP growth lowered to 2.2% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade policies are fueling economic uncertainty, especially for major U.S. trading partners like Mexico and Canada while driving up global inflation.Source: The Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsAngst pervades a pair of Republican town halls \u2014 one in Trump country, the other in a swing stateWhat Happened: GOP lawmakers faced backlash at town halls in North Carolina and Wyoming over Trump\u2019s agenda.
