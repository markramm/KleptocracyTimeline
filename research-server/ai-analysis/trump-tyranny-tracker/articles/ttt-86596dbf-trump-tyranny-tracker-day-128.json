We\u2019ll explore the latest geopolitical shifts, Russia\u2019s growing influence, and what it means for the U.S. and Europe going forward.This is an open AMA format\u2014come with your questions, insights, or just listen in on an urgent conversation.This event is open to all paid subscribers\u2014whether you\u2019re with me or with Julie Roginsky, Salty Politics, you\u2019re invited to join us. Please use the registration link below to sign up!Registration Link: https://forms.gle/KThegwuJHtrCucPS8\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Pardons Tax Cheat After Mother Attends $1 Million FundraiserWhat Happened: Trump granted a full pardon to Paul Walczak, a convicted tax fraudster, shortly after his mother, Elizabeth Fago\u2014a top Trump fundraiser\u2014attended a $1 million per head Mar-a-Lago dinner. Walczak\u2019s application emphasized Fago\u2019s political donations and her ties to the Ashley Biden diary theft plot.Why It Matters: This is more blatant pay-to-play corruption. Trump spared a wealthy ally from prison and $4.4 million in restitution, overriding a judge\u2019s ruling that \u201cthere is not a get-out-of-jail-free card\u201d for the rich. Trump continues to use his pardon power as a reward for loyalty.Source: New York TimesTrump to Pardon Reality Stars Todd and Julie ChrisleyWhat Happened: Trump will issue pardons for reality TV couple Todd and Julie Chrisley, convicted in 2022 for defrauding banks out of over $30 million and evading federal taxes. Trump called their treatment \u201charsh,\u201d and their daughter, Savannah\u2014an RNC speaker and Trump supporter\u2014personally lobbied for clemency.Why It Matters: Trump isn\u2019t hiding his corruption this time\u2014whether it\u2019s crypto schemes or pardons, it\u2019s all out in the open. The Chrisleys got a loyalty reward. Under Trump, the law doesn\u2019t apply if you\u2019re rich, famous, and most importantly, MAGA.Source: Washington PostTrump Questions if US Gold is Missing\u2014Allies Use Conspiracy to Sell GoldWhat Happened: Trump revived a debunked conspiracy about missing gold at Fort Knox, contradicting past audits and his own Treasury secretary. The baseless claim is now echoing through MAGA media and being used to push gold investments.Why It Matters: This is Trump turning conspiracy into currency\u2014again. His lies aren\u2019t just political but profitable, fueling fear to benefit allies selling gold. Source: New York TimesTrump Pardons Former Virginia Sheriff Convicted of BriberyWhat Happened: Trump issued a full pardon to Scott Jenkins, the ex-sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted of taking $75,000 in bribes in exchange for handing out deputy badges. Jenkins had been sentenced to 10 years in prison, but Trump claimed the case was \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is another clear abuse of presidential power. Trump once again shielded a loyalist convicted of serious crimes, overriding a jury\u2019s verdict and bypassing DOJ guidelines. Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s border czar earned consulting fees from immigrant detention firmWhat Happened: Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d received consulting payments from the Geo Group\u2014one of the private prison giants profiting from immigrant detention\u2014just before reentering government. Homan is now leading the charge to massively expand detention capacity and contracts benefiting Geo Group.Why It Matters: This is textbook corruption. A top official shaping U.S. immigration policy was on the payroll of the very company set to rake in hundreds of millions from his policies. Source: Washington PostTrump Media Turns to Bitcoin in $2.5 Billion Crypto PivotWhat Happened: Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent of Truth Social, confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion\u2014$1.5 billion in equity, $1 billion in debt, to build a massive bitcoin reserve. CEO Devin Nunes declared crypto a core \u201cfinancial freedom\u201d asset aligned with America First ideology.Why It Matters: TMTG\u2019s pivot to a bitcoin-holding company is a red flag. Trump is merging political clout with financial speculation, widening the door to self-dealing, market manipulation, and profiteering off the presidency. The Trump family is cashing in on crypto hype while rewriting the rules.Source: WIRED\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsBureau of Land Management ousts official who reportedly resisted DOGEWhat Happened: Michael Nedd, a 30-year veteran at the Bureau of Land Management, was escorted out by security after reportedly telling staff to ignore an unauthorized DOGE-backed memo freezing internal job moves. Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s operatives are purging civil servants who resist illegal or extreme directives. Nedd\u2019s removal mirrors other politically motivated purges, and dissent is being punished systemwide as Trump consolidates power.Source: Washington Post Republican Attacks On GAO Escalate After Office Condemns DOGE CutsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget loyalist, Russ Vought (Project 2025), and MAGA lawmakers lashed out at the Government Accountability Office after it found Trump\u2019s team illegally withheld EV infrastructure funds. GAO also reportedly blocked Elon Musk\u2019s operatives from interfering with audits.Why It Matters: This is another attack on independent oversight. MAGA leaders are trying to destroy the watchdog exposing abuse of power, discrediting an office tasked with keeping the president's actions in check.Source: Talking Points Memo\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Halts New Student Visas, Expands Social Media SurveillanceWhat Happened: The State Department has paused all new foreign student visa appointments as it prepares to implement stricter social media vetting. The move is part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on international students, citing \u201cantisemitism.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is a dangerous escalation of political censorship. Trump is using \u201cantisemitism\u201d as a smokescreen to vet and ban students for their beliefs\u2014turning visa policy into a tool for ideological control and academic purges.Source: Washington PostTrump Moves to Fully Cut Off Harvard\u2019s Federal ContractsWhat Happened: Trump has ordered all federal agencies to terminate their remaining contracts with Harvard University, worth roughly $100 million, citing unproven claims of \u201cantisemitism and racial discrimination.\u201d Agencies must submit cancellation plans by June 6 and find alternative vendors.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal power to punish academic dissent, using antisemitism as cover. International students are a test case for a wider authoritarian takeover of education and the silencing of all students.Source: Wall Street JournalICE Taps into Nationwide AI-Enabled Camera Network, Data ShowsWhat Happened: ICE is quietly using Flock Safety\u2019s nationwide license plate camera network by leaning on local police \u201cfavors\u201d and joint probes\u2014despite having no official contract. Internal logs show thousands of post-inauguration lookups tied to \u201cICE WARRANT\u201d and \u201cillegal immigration.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s team is using private surveillance tools like Flock to quietly build a mass tracking system\u2014starting with immigration enforcement, but will be expanded for wider targeting. This is how authoritarian infrastructure takes root.Source: 404 MediaTrump\u2019s New Pardon Attorney Is Eager to Target Biden-Era CasesWhat Happened: Trump appointed loyalist Ed Martin as pardon attorney, who is now fast-tracking clemency for MAGA allies convicted under the Biden administration\u2014starting with Scott Jenkins, a former sheriff convicted of bribery. Martin is also preparing to restore gun rights for felons under newly transferred authority from the DOJ.Why It Matters: The pardon office is no longer about justice. Martin is using clemency to reward Trump\u2019s loyalists and convicted criminals, turning retribution into federal policy while Trump targets opposition.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump's pardon attorney discussed pardoning final Jan. 6 defendants \u2014 including Oath Keepers' Stewart Rhodes, lawyer saysWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s pardon attorney Ed Martin met with legal allies seeking full pardons for high-profile Jan. 6 insurrectionists\u2014including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and multiple Proud Boys leaders. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s team tried to whitewash sedition by pardoning convicted insurrectionists; they\u2019re not just rewriting history\u2014they\u2019re greenlighting future political violence and elevating January 6 insurrectionists as patriotic martyrs of the regime. And, no amount of whitewashing will make us forget the attack on January 6.Source: CBS NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsThe New Dark AgeWhat Happened: Trump has launched a sweeping attack on education, science, and historical memory\u2014purging scientists, defunding universities, and purging public-health data. Federal grants are being revoked from institutions that refuse to align with MAGA ideology.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate effort to destroy America\u2019s systems of knowledge and truth. If successful, it will plunge the country into a new Dark Age\u2014where facts are criminalized, research halted, and power preserved through ignorance.Source: The AtlanticThreats Against Federal Judges Spike Amid Trump\u2019s Attacks on JudiciaryWhat Happened: New U.S. Marshals data reveals a staggering rise in threats against federal judges since Trump\u2019s return to power. From March 1 to April 14 alone, 162 judges were targeted\u2014more than double the number in the five months prior. The surge aligns with Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on judges blocking his executive actions.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s public attacks on the judiciary are fueling real-world threats, undermining the rule of law, and putting judges\u2019 lives at risk. Nearly a third of federal judges have faced threats this year.Source: New York TimesTrump Is Getting the Military Parade He Wanted in His First TermWhat Happened: Trump will stage a massive military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14\u2014his 79th birthday\u2014featuring 28 Abrams tanks, 6,700 troops, helicopters, paratroopers, and vintage uniforms. Why It Matters: This is authoritarian theater straight out of the Russia and North Korea playbook. Trump is hijacking the military for a personal spectacle\u2014turning soldiers, tanks, and taxpayer dollars into a propaganda show to glorify himself.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE Detains NYC High School Student in Courthouse StingWhat Happened: ICE agents arrested 20-year-old Dylan, a Venezuelan student at a Bronx high school, inside a Manhattan immigration courthouse during what was supposed to be a routine hearing. He had no criminal record and was part of a Biden-era asylum program. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation tactics are now targeting migrant students during court appearances and bypassing due process. Dylan is now in detention, and his family fears for his life if deported. Source: New York TimesTexas Nears Law Requiring Ten Commandments in Public School ClassroomsWhat Happened: Texas is set to pass a bill requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, affecting over 5 million students. Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign it into law, echoing similar actions in Louisiana and Oklahoma.Why It Matters: Mandating religious texts in public schools is a violation of church\u2013state separation, amounts to government-backed coercion, and marginalizes non-Christian and secular students.Source: Washington PostCorporate America's retreat from DEI has eliminated thousands of jobsWhat Happened: U.S. companies have cut over 2,600 DEI-related jobs, retreating from diversity programs amid Trump\u2019s executive orders and political backlash. Major firms like Verizon and Walmart are dropping or rebranding DEI initiatives.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on workplace equity and civil rights. The purge of DEI professionals reflects a coordinated rollback of progress toward inclusion.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchAt Veterans Affairs, plan for sweeping cuts tanks moraleWhat Happened: Trump plans to purge 83,000 jobs\u201415% of the Department of Veterans Affairs workforce\u2014sparking mass early retirements and panic. Morale is collapsing as staff and veterans fear massive disruptions to care and benefits.Why It Matters: This is a catastrophic assault on millions of veterans, as Trump plans to gut the agency that delivers health care, disability assistance, and support services, while demanding silence from employees via NDAs. Source: Washington PostUS Drops COVID Vaccine Recommendation for Healthy Kids, Pregnant WomenWhat Happened: The CDC removed COVID-19 vaccines from its guidance for healthy kids and pregnant women, under orders from RFK Jr., without consulting its scientific advisory panel. This breaks from global health standards and mounting safety data.Why It Matters: It\u2019s a dangerous, politically driven rollback of science-based policy. Ignoring expert advice puts lives at risk, threatens vaccine access, and reiterates Trump\u2019s assault on public health infrastructure.Source: ReutersA big Trump administration cutback went nearly unnoticedWhat Happened: In April, Trump abruptly purged over 32,000 AmeriCorps members by canceling $400 million in grants\u2014without public notice or legal process. The cuts, driven by Musk, dismantled national service programs in education, food security, mental health, and disaster response.Why It Matters: Another targeted attack on a civic support system. Gutting AmeriCorps cripples services for vulnerable communities and leaves millions without basic support.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s Safety Cuts Leave Workers ExposedWhat Happened: Trump purged 85% of staff at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, gutting core workplace safety research. Only a fraction were reinstated after public backlash.Why It Matters: Experts warn this will lead to more injuries, lost research, and weakened emergency readiness, sacrificing worker safety for politics.Source: The GuardianWhite House stunned as Hegseth inquiry brings up illegal wiretap claimsWhat Happened: Trump advisers are losing faith in a Pentagon leak investigation used by Pete Hegseth to justify firing three top aides. The fallout began after Hegseth\u2019s lawyer floated an explosive and unverified claim that the NSA used an illegal, warrantless wiretap to identify the leaker(s).Why It Matters: The allegation stunned Trump\u2019s inner circle and exposed chaos inside the Pentagon. With no evidence and infighting at the top, national security is being sacrificed.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchKing Charles Defends Canada\u2019s Sovereignty Amid Trump\u2019s Annexation ThreatsWhat Happened: In a rare address to Canada\u2019s parliament, King Charles III strongly reaffirmed Canadian sovereignty in response to Trump\u2019s threats to annex Canada. He backed a new defense investment plan and emphasized ties with Europe.Why It Matters: The address was a direct rejection of Trump\u2019s imperialist rhetoric. Canada is drawing a clear line\u2014militarily and diplomatically\u2014against U.S. threats, while turning toward Europe as Trump destabilizes North American security.Source: The TimesHow U.S. cuts in Somalia could imperil the fight against al-ShababWhat Happened: Trump has slashed foreign aid and security support in Africa, pulling back U.S. assistance to Somali special forces and questioning the value of fighting al-Shabab. As militants regain territory, Somalia is turning to Turkey for military backing.Why It Matters: The U.S. withdrawal risks a dangerous power vacuum. Al-Shabab\u2014al-Qaeda\u2019s strongest affiliate\u2014is resurging, and America\u2019s disengagement is paving the way for Turkish military influence to grow. This will destabilize the Horn of Africa and shift regional alliances away from the U.S.Source: Washington PostNoem blasts 'weak' European leaders, stumps for conservative candidate in PolandWhat Happened: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stunned diplomats by endorsing far-right Polish candidate Karol Nawrocki at CPAC Warsaw, slamming his opponent as \u201ca train wreck\u201d and attacking Biden over immigration and terrorism.Why It Matters: A sitting U.S. Cabinet official interfering in a foreign election is a diplomatic breach and an embarrassment for the U.S. Noem\u2019s speech exported Trumpism abroad, insulted NATO allies, and risked further fracturing the transatlantic alliance.Source: ABC News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPutin Has Retooled Russia\u2019s Economy to Focus Only on WarWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s economy is now fully dependent on war, driven by nonstop arms production, military salaries, and enlistment bonuses. There\u2019s no plan for Russia to end its genocidal war.Why It Matters: Ending the war would crash Russia\u2019s economy and endanger Putin\u2019s grip on power. As I\u2019ve been saying all along, Russia has no intention of stopping its genocidal war, and over the centuries, no Russian autocrat has survived power after failure in their bloody imperial conquests. The only way this ends is by arming Ukraine to win (not survive) and a total Russian defeat in Ukraine.Source: Wall Street JournalWall Street Journal Urges GOP Senate Revolt on RussiaWhat Happened: The Wall Street Journal editorial board slammed Trump\u2019s weak stance on Putin and called on Senate Republicans to push back. The board accused Trump of enabling Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine through \u201cnaivete\u201d and inaction.Why It Matters: With Trump downplaying Russia\u2019s genocidal war, the Journal is now urging a GOP rebellion to force a tougher U.S. posture\u2014warning that appeasement will only prolong bloodshed and embolden Moscow.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsUS Business Spending on Equipment Slumps Amid Tariff UncertaintyWhat Happened: Orders for core capital goods\u2014a key measure of business investment\u2014fell 1.3% in April, the biggest drop in six months. Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy is fueling uncertainty, delaying equipment purchases, and weakening business confidence. Durable goods orders overall plunged 6.3%.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s trade chaos is dragging down business investment, long seen as a pillar of economic growth. Companies are stalling on capital spending due to tariff volatility, which threatens to undermine the broader economy just as consumer confidence rebounds.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite on June 6th in D.C.NPR Sues Trump Over Order to Cut Off Public Media FundingWhat Happened: NPR and other public radio stations are suing Trump over an executive order that ends federal funding for public media. The lawsuit argues the order violates the First Amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, calling it political retaliation.Source: Wall Street JournalUS Judge Allows States' Lawsuit Against DOGE to ProceedWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that 14 states can proceed with their lawsuit challenging Elon Musk\u2019s role as head of the DOGE agency. The court found that the states made a plausible claim that Musk's cost-cutting activities were \"unauthorized by any law.\"Source: ReutersJudge Blocks Trump from Killing NYC Congestion Program\u2014for NowWhat Happened: A federal judge temporarily blocked Trump from cutting transportation funding to New York over its Manhattan congestion pricing plan. The ruling halts Trump\u2019s effort to revoke approval of the program, which charges drivers to reduce traffic and fund transit upgrades.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Order Targeting Mueller-Linked Law Firm Struck Down by Federal JudgeWhat Happened: A federal judge struck down Trump\u2019s executive order targeting WilmerHale, the law firm where Robert Mueller worked, calling it an unconstitutional attack on legal independence. The order had barred firm attorneys from federal buildings and stripped security clearances in retaliation for Mueller\u2019s role in the Russia investigation.Source: Wall Street JournalRep. Mike Flood Grilled at Town Hall What Happened: Nebraska Rep. Mike Flood admitted during a tense town hall that he didn\u2019t read a key provision in the House GOP\u2019s bill before voting for it\u2014specifically one that weakens judges\u2019 ability to enforce contempt orders. The crowd erupted in protest as Flood, a lawyer, insisted he supports the courts and only later learned of the provision.Source: NBC NewsFrom Trump Tyranny Tracker Day 123\u2014Call the Senate to stop this provision\u2026Republican Bill Would Limit Judges\u2019 Contempt PowerWhat Happened: House Republicans passed a sweeping bill that would limit federal judges\u2019 power to hold officials in contempt\u2014especially in cases where plaintiffs were not required to post bond for injunctions. The bill arrives as multiple Trump officials face contempt threats for defying deportation-related court orders.Why It Matters: The measure would shield Trump allies from legal consequences, undermine judicial authority, and retroactively interfere with active court cases. It\u2019s another dangerous step toward dismantling checks on executive overreach.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers6/6 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action162 \u2014 Federal judges threatened from March 1\u2013April 14, more than double the previous five months83,000 \u2014 VA jobs, Trump plans to purge\u201415% of the department\u2019s workforce2,600+ \u2014 DEI professionals laid off across U.S. corporations$1 million \u2014 Price per head at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago fundraiser attended by Paul Walczak\u2019s mother $4.4 million \u2014 Restitution waived by Trump in Paul Walczak pardon$2.5 billion \u2014 Trump Media\u2019s planned crypto raise\u2014$1.5B equity, $1B debt6,700 \u2014 Troops mobilized for Trump\u2019s June 14 military parade28 \u2014 Abrams tanks to appear in parade32,000+ \u2014 AmeriCorps members purged via canceled grants$100 million \u2014 Total value of  federal contracts with Harvard that will be terminated1.3% \u2014 Drop in core capital goods orders in April\u2014largest in 6 months6.3% \u2014 Plunge in overall durable goods orders in April14 \u2014 States suing to block Musk\u2019s role in DOGE5 million+ \u2014 Students impacted by Texas law mandating the Ten Commandments in classrooms\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Federal judges are under siege \u2014 Can the judiciary maintain independence amid unprecedented threats and political attacks?Trump is hijacking the military for political spectacle \u2014 Will Trump face political backlash over his authoritarian style glorification parade?Trump is purging oversight agencies at alarming speed \u2014 Can the courts stop the dismantling of independent watchdogs, or will judicial oversight fall next?Trump is targeting public media to silence dissent \u2014 Will NPR\u2019s lawsuit be enough to stop Trump from defunding independent journalism?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets.

Walczak\\u2019s application emphasized Fago\\u2019s political donations and her ties to the Ashley Biden diary theft plot.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is more blatant pay-to-play corruption. Trump spared a wealthy ally from prison and $4.4 million in restitution, overriding a judge\\u2019s ruling that \\u201Cthere is not a get-out-of-jail-free card\\u201D for the rich.

The baseless claim is now echoing through MAGA media and being used to push gold investments.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is Trump turning conspiracy into currency\\u2014again.

Jenkins had been sentenced to 10 years in prison, but Trump claimed the case was \\u201Cpolitically motivated.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another clear abuse of presidential power.

CEO Devin Nunes declared crypto a core \\u201Cfinancial freedom\\u201D asset aligned with America First ideology.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> TMTG\\u2019s pivot to a bitcoin-holding company is a red flag.

GAO also reportedly blocked Elon Musk\\u2019s operatives from interfering with audits.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another attack on independent oversight.

Martin is also preparing to restore gun rights for felons under newly transferred authority from the DOJ.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The pardon office is no longer about justice.
