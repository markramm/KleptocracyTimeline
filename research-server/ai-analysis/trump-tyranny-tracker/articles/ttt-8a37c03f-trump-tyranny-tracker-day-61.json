Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 \u201cFighting Oligarchy\u201d tour, Friday, March 21, 2025.Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 21Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsElon Musk holds unprecedented Pentagon talks, wants leakers prosecutedWhat Happened: Musk met with Defense Secretary Hegseth at the Pentagon, demanding the prosecution of leakers after reports claimed he would be briefed on U.S. war plans for China. Trump denied the briefing but admitted Musk\u2019s China ties could be a conflict.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s deepening influence over government operations, particularly national security is dangerous given his extensive business ties in China. His push to prosecute leakers highlights an escalating attack on transparency and press freedom under Trump, heightening fears of authoritarian overreach.Source: ReutersMusk Offers $100 to Wisconsin Voters, Reviving Controversial TacticWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s America PAC is offering $100 to Wisconsin voters who sign a petition against \"activist judges,\" aiming to mobilize conservative voters ahead of the April 1 Wisconsin Supreme Court race. The PAC has already spent $11 million backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, a Trump ally.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s cash-for-signatures strategy mirrors his 2024 election efforts, which faced legal challenges over potential election interference. The petition serves as a data-gathering tool to identify likely Republican voters. Additionally, Musk has personal stakes in Wisconsin, with Tesla suing the state over dealership restrictions.Source: The New York TimesCBO projects deficits will sharply rise if Trump tax cuts made permanentWhat Happened: The Congressional Budget Office projects that if Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts are made permanent, the national debt will soar to 214% of GDP by 2054, far exceeding previous estimates. Extending the cuts would add $4.7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Why It Matters: Trump and his cronies claim tax cuts won\u2019t worsen the deficit, but the CBO\u2019s analysis proves otherwise. The projections highlight the reckless fiscal policy behind Trump\u2019s agenda, which benefits the wealthy while pushing the U.S. toward a financial crisis.Source: The HillPentagon Scraps Musk Briefing on China War PlansWhat Happened: The Pentagon canceled a planned top-secret war briefing for Elon Musk after a New York Times report exposed it. Originally set for \"the Tank\" with Admiral Paparo, the meeting was downgraded to a brief session with Defense Secretary Hegseth. Why It Matters: This raises serious national security concerns over Musk\u2019s unprecedented government access and influence, contradicting Trump\u2019s heavy reliance on him.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsIn another tense hearing, Judge Boasberg says Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act has \u2018frightening\u2019 implicationsWhat Happened: U.S. District Judge James Boasberg expressed deep concern over Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, calling it an \u201cunprecedented and expanded use\u201d of the 1798 wartime law. During a heated hearing, he criticized the Justice Department\u2019s failure to comply with his orders to halt deportation flights and demanded accountability for those who allowed them to continue. Trump argues the law is beyond judicial review, a stance the judge warned will lead to unchecked executive power.Why It Matters: Boasberg\u2019s rebuke highlights the constitutional crisis brewing over Trump\u2019s authoritarian moves\u2014as he openly defies court orders while his allies attack the judiciary. With Trump calling for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment and Chief Justice John Roberts issuing a rare rebuke, the battle over executive power is escalating.Source: CNNJustice Department confirms Cabinet talks about Trump keeping deportation info secretWhat Happened: The Justice Department confirmed Cabinet-level discussions on whether Trump should invoke the \u201cstate-secrets\u201d privilege to block disclosure of details on Venezuelan deportation flights. A federal judge ordered the government to provide specifics, but Trump officials argue revealing the information would cause \"catastrophic\" harm.Why It Matters: This is a blatant attempt to hide mass deportations under the guise of national security while more media outlets have identified some of the migrants and confirmed that they have no criminal history\u2014some even have asylum court hearings scheduled. Trump is using secrecy to dodge court orders, prevent public scrutiny, and continue weaponizing the Alien Enemies Act without accountability.Source: USA TodayMusk and Trump Standardize Chaos, Undermining U.S. StabilityWhat Happened: Trump and Musk\u2019s erratic governance has created nationwide turmoil\u2014mass firings, judicial defiance, reckless economic policies, and a wholesale dismantling of government institutions. Internationally, U.S. allies are pulling away, fearing instability and Trump\u2019s closeness to Putin. Meanwhile, Musk has cemented his grip on federal operations, openly attacking the judiciary and Congress.Why It Matters: The chaos isn\u2019t accidental\u2014it\u2019s a deliberate strategy to normalize lawlessness and push the U.S. toward authoritarian rule. As institutions struggle to keep up, the guardrails of democracy are being stripped away at lightning speed.Source: WIREDTrump Orders Full Data Access for Designated Officials, Expanding DOGE\u2019s ReachWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order granting any officials designated by the president or agency heads full access to all unclassified federal records, IT systems, and data\u2014including third-party databases linked to federally funded state programs. Agencies must eliminate any internal rules restricting data sharing within 30 days.Why It Matters: This gives Trump\u2019s hand-picked operatives, including those from Musk, sweeping access to sensitive government data, overriding agency policies designed to protect personal and institutional information. With prior reports of improper data sharing, this will lead to mass privacy violations and political abuse of federal records.Source: FedScoop\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump pulls security clearances for Kamala Harris, Hillary ClintonWhat Happened: Trump revoked security clearances for Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, and other political opponents, citing \"national interest.\" The move follows his earlier decision to cut Joe Biden from intelligence briefings.Why It Matters: This is blatant political retribution. Trump is weaponizing national security protocols to punish critics\u2014 at a time of heightened threats and political violence\u2014 and eliminate access to classified information traditionally granted to former officials. Source: ReutersCommerce Secretary: Only \"Fraudsters\" Would Complain About Missed Social Security ChecksWhat Happened: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended Trump's Social Security \u201crestructuring,\u201d claiming that missed checks would only concern \"fraudsters,\" not legitimate recipients. He argued that stopping payments would help identify fraud, dismissing concerns from elderly beneficiaries.Why It Matters: Trump is openly laying the groundwork to gut Social Security, with Musk calling it a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and pushing for massive entitlement cuts. Their rhetoric signals a looming crisis for millions of Americans.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Suggests Tesla Vandals Be Sent to El Salvador PrisonsWhat Happened: Trump threatened those attacking Tesla properties with 20-year prison sentences and suggested they could be sent to El Salvador\u2019s notorious prisons. Why It Matters: The regime is escalating its response to Tesla-related crimes, labeling them \"domestic terrorism.\" Threatening to send U.S. citizens to foreign prisons is illegal and something we need to monitor.Source: ABC NewsThreats to federal judges increasing, US Marshals Service warnsWhat Happened: The U.S. Marshals Service has warned federal judges about a sharp rise in threats, particularly those ruling on cases involving Trump. Some judges have received direct threats, while members of Congress push for impeachments against judges who ruled against Trump.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary are fueling intimidation, eroding judicial independence, and threatening the rule of law. With threats against judges surging\u2014 the integrity and safety of the courts, and law are at serious risk.Source: ABC NewsPopcorn Mogul\u2019s Coup Fails: Pirate\u2019s Booty Founder Loses Mayoral RaceWhat Happened: Pirate\u2019s Booty Snacks founder Robert Ehrlich attempted to seize control of Sea Cliff, NY, falsely declaring himself mayor. \u201cHe presented a statement falsely asserting his authority as mayor, demanding access to office space, and declaring that the entire village staff was fired effective immediately but could reapply for their jobs.\u201d After being removed, he ran a write-in campaign and lost 1,064 to 62.Why It Matters: Another case of a wealthy businessman believing rules don\u2019t apply to him. Ehrlich\u2019s failed coup mirrors Musk\u2019s aggressive federal overreach under Trump, with self-declared authority and blatant disregard for laws.Source: The GuardianUnder Trump\u2019s Threat, Columbia University Surrenders to Federal DemandsWhat Happened: Columbia University caved to Trump\u2019s demands, agreeing to overhaul protest rules, put its Middle East studies department under new control, hire more campus security with arrest powers, and adopt a Trump-backed definition of antisemitism\u2014all to regain $400 million in frozen federal funding.Why It Matters: This is state coercion, not policy. Trump is using federal money to dictate what universities can teach, who they can hire, and how students can protest\u2014setting a dangerous precedent for government control over higher education and silencing dissent.Source: Associated PressTrump Expands Immigration Crackdown to Target Legal Immigrants and TouristsWhat Happened: Trump has intensified border enforcement, detaining visa holders, green card holders, and even tourists based on speech and political beliefs. Foreign nationals have been subjected to aggressive questioning, prolonged detentions, and electronic device searches.Why It Matters: This isn't immigration enforcement\u2014it\u2019s political repression. Targeting legal visitors and immigrants over their views sends a chilling message, weaponizing border security to silence dissent and punish critics of the regime. Source: The New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Drops Policy Prohibiting Segregated Facilities for Federal ContractorsWhat Happened: Trump removed a long-standing civil rights policy that explicitly banned segregated facilities in workplaces with federal contracts. The provision, in place since the 1960s, barred separate waiting rooms, restrooms, work areas, and lunchrooms.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling DEI policies, signaling a retreat from civil rights enforcement. While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 still bans discrimination, gutting these protections weakens enforcement and opens the door to workplace segregation.Source: The New York TimesTrump Halts Legal Aid for Migrant ChildrenWhat Happened: Trump cut funding for legal representation for unaccompanied migrant children, affecting 26,000 minors. The only remaining funding is for \"Know Your Rights\" presentations in detention centers.Why It Matters: Stripping legal aid leaves children to represent themselves in immigration court, drastically increasing deportations. This is a cruel escalation of Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda, targeting the most vulnerable\u2014children.Source: ABC NewsTrump Revokes Legal Status for 530,000 Migrants, Paving Way for Mass DeportationsWhat Happened: Trump is revoking parole status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who legally entered the U.S. under a Biden-era program. Effective April 24, those affected will be placed in expedited removal, making them vulnerable to deportation. Trump has also hinted at stripping parole from 240,000 Ukrainians.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown continues to escalate, targeting legally admitted migrants and setting the stage for mass deportations. It will force thousands into legal limbo and separate families.Source: ReutersTrump Shuts Down 3 Watchdog Agencies Overseeing Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security is gutting its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. These offices provided oversight on civil rights issues, detention conditions, and immigration case assistance.Why It Matters: The move comes as Trump accelerates deportations without due process and removes transparency mechanisms that could scrutinize his policies. This is a blatant effort to sidestep accountability and eliminate protections for migrants and asylum seekers.Source: The New York TimesTrump Moves to Deport Pro-Palestinian Cornell StudentWhat Happened: U.S. immigration officials have ordered Momodou Taal, a Cornell doctoral student, and British-Gambian dual citizen, to surrender to ICE as part of Trump\u2019s crackdown on pro-Palestinian foreign protesters. Why It Matters: Trump continues weaponizing immigration enforcement to silence dissent, conflating criticism of Israel with support for Hamas. Taal\u2019s case follows similar actions against pro-Palestinian students at Columbia and Georgetown.Source: ReutersRadio Free Asia Gutted as Trump Slashes Funding, Journalists Fear DeportationWhat Happened: Trump placed 75% of Radio Free Asia staff on leave following funding cuts. Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty also had their federal grants terminated. At least 8 RFA journalists now risk deportation, while 5 former RFA employees are already imprisoned overseas.Why It Matters: This cripples U.S.-funded independent media, handing authoritarian regimes a victory by silencing critical reporting. RFA has been a key tool of U.S. soft power, exposing censorship in China, Vietnam, and North Korea\u2014its potential shutdown weakens America\u2019s global influence.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchSocial Security Leader Warns of Halt to Agency\u2019s Work, Before BacktrackingWhat Happened: Acting Social Security Commissioner Leland Dudek warned that a judge\u2019s order restricting Musk\u2019s operatives from accessing agency data might force a shutdown of SSA operations. Hours later, after Judge Ellen Hollander clarified her ruling, Dudek backtracked, saying the agency would remain open and benefits would continue.Why It Matters: The chaos at SSA raises alarms about delayed payments for 73 million Americans. They are laying the groundwork to gut Social Security.Source: The New York TimesFBI scales back staffing, tracking of domestic terrorism probesWhat Happened: The FBI has reassigned staff from its Domestic Terrorism Operations Section and scrapped a key tracking tool for extremism cases. Meanwhile, agents are being redirected to assist Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, and attacks on Tesla property are now being treated as domestic terrorism.Why It Matters: The FBI is deprioritizing white supremacist and militia threats while cracking down on Trump\u2019s political enemies. This follows Trump\u2019s mass pardons of Jan. 6 insurrectionists and rioters and signals a dangerous shift where critics of Trump and Musk face aggressive prosecution.Source: ReutersFired Federal Workers Now Prime Targets for Private Firms, Foreign GovernmentsWhat Happened: Thousands of federal workers fired under Trump\u2019s government overhaul are recruited by private companies, state governments, and even foreign adversaries, raising national security concerns.Why It Matters: Intelligence experts warn that displaced workers, especially those with high-level security clearances, will be targeted by foreign intelligence agencies. Source: ABC NewsCDC, NIH and more health agencies brace for layoffs with DOGE and RFK Jr.'s restructuringWhat Happened: Trump is moving forward with mass layoffs across federal health agencies, including the CDC, NIH, and FDA, under RFK Jr.\u2019s purge plan. Cuts would eliminate 30% of CDC staff, gut NIH funding, and slash 90% of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.Why It Matters: Public health infrastructure is being dismantled, with key programs on disease prevention, medical research, and mental health funding on the chopping block. This will cripple the government\u2019s ability to respond to health crises.Source: CBS NewsSBA to Cut 40% of Workforce as Trump Slashes Federal AgenciesWhat Happened: The Small Business Administration is eliminating 2,700 jobs\u2014over 40% of its workforce\u2014as part of Trump's purge. Why It Matters: With SBA programs critical for small businesses, the cuts will hinder access to loans and support, potentially impacting entrepreneurs nationwide.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Moves Student Loan Management to Small Business Administration Amid Massive CutsWhat Happened: Trump announced that the Small Business Administration will take over the country\u2019s $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio from the Department of Education, following his executive order to dismantle the agency. SBA has no experience managing student loans, raising concerns about errors, borrower protections, and loan forgiveness programs.Why It Matters: The will cause widespread disruption for over 40 million borrowers. Meanwhile, the SBA is simultaneously cutting 40% of its workforce, further complicating its ability to handle such a massive transition. Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchU.K., Germany, and Nordic Nations Warn Citizens About U.S. Border DetentionsWhat Happened: The U.K., Germany, Denmark, and Finland have updated travel advisories, warning citizens that having a valid U.S. visa or ESTA does not guarantee entry. Reports of European travelers being detained, denied entry, or even arrested at U.S. borders have raised alarm. Nordic countries have also issued specific warnings for transgender travelers, citing new U.S. policies that could lead to denial of entry based on gender markers.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is straining diplomatic ties, with key allies warning their citizens about arbitrary detentions and deportations. The U.S. is sending a message: even legal travelers are at risk if they don\u2019t align with the regime\u2019s policies.Source: USA TodayU.S. Shuts Canadians Out of Historic Cross-Border LibraryWhat Happened: Trump is barring Canadians from accessing the Haskell Free Library & Opera House, a unique facility straddling the Vermont-Quebec border. New rules will initially limit access via the Canadian side to staff and people with disabilities, with a full closure planned later this year.Why It Matters: A symbol of cross-border friendship is being shut down under Trump\u2019s crackdown and retribution, severing decades of cultural exchange and community ties.

Trump also suggested U.S. ownership of Ukraine\u2019s power plants to \"protect\" infrastructure.Why It Matters: Trump is openly advocating for dividing up Ukraine, on behalf of Putin and to further Russian interests while actively undermining Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. Europe must take a stronger stand in supporting Ukraine, while Putin and Trump\u2019s agenda should be dismissed outright.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s Auto Tariffs Could Hike Car Prices by $10,000What Happened: A 25% tariff on vehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico is set to take effect on April 2, creating chaos in the auto market. Dealers and analysts warn prices could rise by $3,500 to $10,000, while manufacturers scramble to assess costs.Why It Matters: The tariffs will hit consumers hard, raising costs for new cars, repairs, and maintenance.
