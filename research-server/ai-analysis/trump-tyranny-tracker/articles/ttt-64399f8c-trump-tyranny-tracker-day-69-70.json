  "content": "Protesters demonstrate against Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives during a nationwide \"Tesla Takedown\" rally at a dealership on March 29, 2025 in Austin, Texas.BRANDON BELL / Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 29-30Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsElon Musk Hands Out $1 Million Checks to Wisconsin Voters Despite Legal ChallengeWhat Happened: Musk handed out two $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters at a rally in Green Bay, moments after the state Supreme Court declined to block the scheme. Musk claimed the recipients were \u201cspokespeople\u201d for his America PAC\u2014a very bad attempt to dodge vote-buying laws. He\u2019s already funneled over $20 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, calling it vital to Trump\u2019s agenda and GOP control of Congress.Why It Matters: This is a brazen case of political bribery and attempting to influence a Tesla lawsuit. Offering cash to voters guts the principle of free and fair elections. Two courts and even a liberal-majority state Supreme Court refused to stop it, setting a dangerous precedent. If this stands, billionaires will escalate buying influence with direct payouts\u2014shredding election integrity in plain sight.Source: Associated PressTesla\u2019s Wisconsin Lawsuit, Elon Musk, and Brad SchimelWhat Happened: Tesla sued the state of Wisconsin in January, challenging the state's \u201cfactory store\u201d law, which bars vehicle manufacturers from directly selling cars. The lawsuit, initially filed in Outagamie County, was recently moved to Milwaukee County.Why It Matters: Musk has poured over $18 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who would influence Tesla\u2019s legal fight.Source: Milwaukee Journal SentinelThe Trump family is cashing in on crypto. It\u2019s creating problems in Congress.What Happened: Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump\u2019s company, World Liberty Financial, announced the launch of a new stablecoin, USD1, just as Republicans pushed crypto legislation through Congress. The move is complicating efforts to secure bipartisan support, especially from Democrats who are highlighting how Trump and his family are profiting from the bill.Why It Matters: The stablecoin rollout will benefit the Trump family financially from legislation they helped influence\u2014creating an ethical minefield. Rep. Maxine Waters is now expected to oppose the bill unless it includes provisions to block Trump and Musk from issuing stablecoins. This is blatant corruption and Democrats must use all the tools to stop this.Source: Politico\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Won\u2019t Rule Out Third Term, Floats Workarounds in NBC InterviewWhat Happened: In a phone interview, Trump said he\u2019s \u201cnot joking\u201d about the possibility of seeking a third term\u2014despite the constitutional ban under the 22nd Amendment. Trump claimed \u201cthere are methods\u201d for staying in power beyond two terms and floated scenarios like Vance taking office and handing it back to him. \u201cA lot of people want me to do it,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cI like working.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is laying the groundwork to stay in power using identical tactics Putin used in Russia. This isn\u2019t a joke\u2014it\u2019s a strategy to desensitize Americans to authoritarian rule. He\u2019s testing the system for a power grab, and his sycophants are helping him stretch and break constitutional limits. It needs to be taken seriously\u2014and we must be ready to push back.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Election Order Creates Confusion Ahead of 2026 VoteWhat Happened: Trump signed a sweeping executive order attempting to reshape how U.S. elections are run\u2014just months before officials begin preparing for the 2026 midterms. The order imposes a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, demands decertification of many voting machines, slashes cybersecurity support, and threatens federal funding to election offices that don\u2019t comply.Why It Matters: This is chaos by design. Trump\u2019s order is a blatant power grab that will disenfranchise voters, overwhelm election systems, and sow mass confusion\u2014all without legislation or legal authority. It\u2019s the kind of move authoritarians use to break democracy from within. Source: Associated PressWhite House Takes Highly Unusual Step of Directly Firing Line ProsecutorsWhat Happened: Two career prosecutors in Los Angeles and Memphis were abruptly fired via a one-sentence email \u201con behalf of the president,\u201d without explanation. Their dismissals reflect a highly unusual and direct intervention by the Trump White House into lower levels of the Justice Department.Why It Matters: The move bypasses long-standing norms protecting career civil servants from political interference. Legal experts and DOJ veterans called it unprecedented, especially as Trump pushes the unitary executive theory, asserting total presidential control over the executive branch.Source: New York TimesTrump Order Could Cripple Federal Worker Unions Fighting DOGE CutsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order removing union protections for over one million federal workers, citing national security. The move strips unions like AFGE of their ability to bargain or defend members just as they resist Musk\u2019s mass purge.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on organized labor in the federal government, targeting unions as part of Trump\u2019s broader campaign of dismantling federal agencies. It severely weakens opposition to job cuts and consolidates executive power.Source: New York TimesDOGE Wants Businesses to Run Government Services \u2018As Much As Possible\u2019What Happened: Musk is driving a massive privatization push across federal agencies. From mail delivery and public lands to foreign aid and weather forecasting, the Trump regime is quietly transferring public functions to private firms\u2014echoing both conservative and Silicon Valley ideologies.Why It Matters: This is a hostile takeover of the U.S. government. Musk and Trump are trying to hand public services to the private sector\u2014gutting accountability and shredding the social safety net. Essential agencies will collapse, and what\u2019s left of American agencies will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsU.S. Institute of Peace Staff Receive Termination NoticesWhat Happened: Nearly all staff at the U.S. Institute of Peace were abruptly terminated Friday. The mass firings follow Trump\u2019s executive order to dismantle the congressionally funded organization and replace its board. Musk operatives have already taken control of USIP\u2019s building, and affected employees received termination emails effective immediately.Why It Matters: This is another Trump-led purge of a congressionally established institution. The U.S. Institute of Peace, founded under Reagan, has spent decades promoting global conflict resolution. Shutting it down is a clear retreat from diplomacy\u2014and a power grab that sidelines independent, peace-focused agencies. This is part of Trump\u2019s authoritarian reordering of U.S. foreign policy.Source: CBS NewsTrump Increasingly Turns to Supreme Court to Override Judges Blocking AgendaWhat Happened: Facing over 130 legal challenges and more than 40 losses in lower courts, Trump is rapidly escalating his use of emergency appeals to the Supreme Court\u2014known as the shadow docket\u2014to bypass rulings halting his controversial executive orders. In just two months, Trump has petitioned the Supreme Court court 6 times, including to resume mass deportations under an obscure 18th-century law and restrict transgender rights.Why It Matters: Trump is attempting to use the Supreme Court to bulldoze judicial oversight, gut the separation of powers, and turn the Court into a political rubber stamp\u2014 like he did with Congress.Source: Associated PressTrump is using the power of government to punish opponents. They\u2019re struggling to respondWhat Happened: Trump is aggressively using the federal government to punish perceived enemies\u2014targeting law firms, universities, cultural institutions, the media, and the judiciary. Through executive orders, loyalist appointments, and threats of defunding, Trump has eroded norms and weakened the checks on presidential power.Why It Matters: Trump is wielding executive power to punish critics, silence media, intimidate law firms, and choke off academic funding. Oversight bodies are being gutted, and many institutions are caving. With most checks collapsing, the judiciary is one of the last lines of defense\u2014and it's under siege too.Source: CNNSecret Pentagon Memo on China, Homeland Has Heritage FingerprintsWhat Happened: A leaked Defense Department memo, signed by Pete Hegseth, reorients the U.S. military around deterring China from seizing Taiwan\u2014largely copying language from a 2024 Heritage Foundation report. The memo deprioritizes Russia and other global threats, shifting homeland defense responsibilities to the Pentagon and leaning heavily on allies abroad.Why It Matters: The memo exposes Trump\u2019s aggressive overhaul of U.S. military priorities\u2014and his regime\u2019s deep reliance on the extremist, far-right Heritage Foundation, behind Project 2025. Extremist ideology is driving national defense strategy.Source: Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump quickly works to concentrate power and muzzle critical voicesWhat Happened: Trump is rapidly consolidating power, targeting law firms, universities, journalists, and civil servants who oppose him. Backed by Elon Musk, he\u2019s firing federal workers, revoking visas, defunding cultural groups, and threatening media access\u2014using executive power to punish enemies, reward allies, and push voter suppression measures that defy the Constitution.Why It Matters: This is a systemic attack on the foundations of democracy. Trump is gutting independent institutions, purging dissent, and laying the groundwork to stay in power indefinitely. The judiciary is the last guardrail, and that\u2019s under attack. America is now an authoritarian state run by Trump, his loyalists, and oligarchs. The constitutional crisis isn\u2019t coming\u2014it\u2019s already here.Source: NBC NewsWhite House Correspondents' Association drops Amber Ruffin from 2025 dinnerWhat Happened: The White House Correspondents' Association announced it will cancel comedian Amber Ruffin\u2019s appearance at the 2025 annual dinner\u2014and for the first time in years, the event will have no comedic performance. Ruffin, a sharp critic of Trump, was previously announced as the headliner. The WHCA claims it wants to \u201cavoid the politics of division.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is pure cowardice. Caving to Trump\u2019s attacks on the press is censorship and not just appeasement but surrender. Every time the media folds, it strengthens a dictator. This isn\u2019t neutrality\u2014it\u2019s complicity.Source: ABC NewsEmboldened Trump Squeezes Traditional MediaWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s White House has banned the Associated Press from events, pressured outlets like Politico and Business Insider, used federal agencies to investigate, and threatened lawsuits. Trump is stripping press access, and demanding coverage changes, as media execs brace for raids, subpoenas, and legal crackdowns.Why It Matters: This is a full-blown assault on the free press. Trump is attempting to silence independent journalism, banning critical outlets, and replacing real reporting with propaganda. It\u2019s a coordinated power grab to control the narrative and crush dissent. Newsrooms are bracing for raids and repression\u2014because this is how authoritarian regimes tighten their grip.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsA Battle Over Religion and Schools in Oklahoma Could Decide the Future of the First AmendmentWhat Happened: Oklahoma Superintendent Ryan Walters is leading a high-stakes legal and cultural campaign to embed Christianity more deeply into the state\u2019s public education system. Under his leadership, Oklahoma approved the nation\u2019s first religious virtual charter school and has pushed to insert the Bible and Christian themes into public school curricula. The case is before the Supreme Court, which is set to hear arguments next month.Why It Matters: This case could dismantle the long-standing separation between church and state. A ruling in Oklahoma\u2019s favor would allow religious groups to access public funding and operate within public education\u2014overturning decades of First Amendment precedent.Source: NBC NewsUniversity of Minnesota Says ICE Detained Graduate StudentWhat Happened: ICE agents detained an international graduate student from the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management. The university said it had no prior knowledge of the detention and called the incident \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d The student\u2019s name, nationality, and visa status remain undisclosed.Why It Matters: This is the latest disappearance by ICE targeting international students\u2014often without charges. Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey are demanding answers as fears grow over civil liberties violations and the chilling effect on academic freedom.Source: NBC NewsTrump Targets Black History at the SmithsonianWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History,\u201d directly attacking the Smithsonian Institution\u2014especially the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Why It Matters: This is a fascist attempt to rewrite history\u2014erasing the legacy of slavery and racial injustice from the national narrative. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re headed in the direction where there\u2019s even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed,\u201d warned historian Clarissa Myrick-Harris of Morehouse College.Source: Associated PressPrivate groups work to identify and report student protesters for possible deportationWhat Happened: Pro-Israel and right-wing Jewish groups are using facial recognition to identify masked student protesters, especially foreign students backing Gaza protests. Names are sent to the Trump regime. Tech firm Stellar Technologies built a tool to unmask and share protester data with pro-deportation groups.Why It Matters: This is a dangerous fusion of authoritarian power and privatized surveillance. Trump\u2019s allies are outsourcing repression\u2014using facial recognition and doxxing to target and silence dissent. These are autocratic tactics to crush political speech and intimidate protesters.Source: Associated PressJohns Hopkins Tells Faculty Not to \u2018Intervene\u2019 in Potential ICE Detainments on CampusWhat Happened: A memo from Johns Hopkins\u2019 Office of General Counsel instructed faculty and staff not to obstruct federal agents, including ICE, if they detain individuals on campus. Employees are told not to intervene, notify those being targeted, or help them evade detention.Why It Matters: Amid a wave of ICE detentions at U.S. universities, the guidance has sparked backlash from groups, including the Hopkins Justice Collective, which is demanding the school become a sanctuary campus and protect vulnerable community members from federal enforcement.Source: The Baltimore Banner\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchState Dept. Leak of Foreign Grants Spreadsheet Puts Lives at Risk, Sources SayWhat Happened: Two sensitive Trump regime spreadsheets detailing State Department and USAID-funded programs were leaked after being shared with Congress\u2014despite prior assurances to international nonprofits that the data would remain secret. The files include information on groups working in hostile regimes like Russia, China, and Iran.Why It Matters: This leak endangers lives. U.S. partners and activists were promised protection, but will now face threats, surveillance, arrests, and possible violence. Groups are scrambling to evacuate staff. Source: Rolling StoneSecDef gives DOD leaders less than two weeks to lay out cuts, changesWhat Happened: Hegseth ordered senior DOD leaders to submit plans by April 11 to cut and restructure the Pentagon\u2019s civilian workforce. With over 760,000 staff, the move includes early retirements and deferred resignations\u2014but warns layoffs may still be needed.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just downsizing\u2014it\u2019s a political purge. The rushed cuts, hiring freeze, and mass firings are designed to gut civilian oversight and remake the Pentagon in Trump\u2019s image. With Musk calling the shots and top officials embracing \u201ctrauma\u201d as a goal, this is about power, not efficiency.Source: Defense OneTrump Fires 50 IRS IT Executives Amid Filing SeasonWhat Happened: The IRS placed around 50 senior IT executives on administrative leave. The removed officials\u2014many overseeing cybersecurity, modernization, and core systems\u2014were among the agency\u2019s top tech leaders. The firings come as the IRS is already drafting plans to cut up to half its 90,000-person staff.Why It Matters: Firing senior IT staff mid-tax season is a recipe for disaster. These experts oversee mission-critical systems protecting taxpayer data and processing returns. This move risks delays, errors, and security breaches. Source: FedScoopGutting US Health Agency Will Allow for Private Sector Takeover, Experts WarnWhat Happened: RFK Jr. announced plans to lay off nearly 20,000 workers\u2014about a quarter of the Department of Health and Human Services. The cuts impact agencies like the CDC, NIH, CMS, and FDA, with 28 branches being consolidated into 15. Why It Matters: This is a direct threat to Americans\u2019 health and safety. The layoffs are a setup to privatize critical services like pandemic response and care for vulnerable communities. Trump and Musk are gutting public health for profit\u2014and calling it reform. Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s U.S.A.I.D. Cuts Hobble Earthquake Response in MyanmarWhat Happened: After a 7.7-magnitude earthquake devastated central Myanmar, killing over 1,700 people, the U.S. failed to send immediate aid. While China, Russia, and neighboring Asian countries rapidly deployed rescue teams, the U.S. has only dispatched a small three-person assessment team, not expected to arrive until Wednesday.Why It Matters: The delayed response highlights how Trump\u2019s dismantling of foreign aid infrastructure has crippled America\u2019s ability to respond to global crises. Once a leader in humanitarian relief, the U.S. is now sidelined while adversaries like Russia and China fill the void.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTrump Says U.S. Will \u2018Get Greenland,\u2019 Refuses to Rule Out Military ForceWhat Happened: In a new interview, Trump said the U.S. will \u201c100%\u201d acquire Greenland and refused to take military force off the table, despite repeated rejections from Denmark and Greenland\u2019s leadership. Why It Matters: Trump is openly floating imperialist land grabs\u2014acting more like Russia than a U.S. president. It threatens to destroy alliances and shows he\u2019s ready to break international laws for power. Trump\u2019s threats need to be taken seriously.Source: USA TodayDenied, Deported, Detained: U.S. Border Incidents Have Travelers Thinking TwiceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is sparking global concern as travelers from Canada, the UK, France, and other allied nations are detained, deported, or denied entry at U.S. borders. Border agents are aggressively searching phones without warrants\u2014even of those with valid visas\u2014and some visitors have been held for weeks in detention.Why It Matters: The chilling effect is real: scholars, tourists, and students are reconsidering U.S. travel, while several countries have issued travel advisories. The aggressive tactics\u2014targeting even lawful travelers from friendly nations\u2014signal an erosion of civil liberties and a shift toward surveillance and suspicion. This will result in long-term damage to America\u2019s image, tourism, and international alliances.Source: NBC NewsTrump Reportedly Warns European Companies to Comply with Anti-DEI OrderWhat Happened: Trump has sent letters to European companies with U.S. government contracts\u2014especially in France and the EU\u2014demanding they certify compliance with Trump\u2019s executive order banning DEI programs. The letters were distributed by American embassies and warned that failure to comply could violate the False Claims Act.Why It Matters: The move extends Trump\u2019s domestic culture war overseas, forcing foreign firms to align with his extremist ideological agenda or risk losing U.S. government business. It\u2019s straining transatlantic ties just as tensions over trade and defense are escalating.Source: CNBCFrance Accuses U.S. Diplomats of Meddling with a \u2018Diktat\u2019 About Trump\u2019s DEI PoliciesWhat Happened: French officials accused U.S. diplomats of meddling in domestic affairs after American embassies warned French companies that Trump\u2019s executive order banning DEI programs applies globally to all U.S. government contractors. The U.S. Embassy in Paris gave firms five days to confirm they don\u2019t run DEI programs that violate U.S. anti-discrimination laws.Why It Matters: This is nuts. Trump\u2019s regime is trying to strong-arm foreign companies into following his anti-DEI agenda\u2014on their soil. France is pushing back hard, calling it a blatant overreach and political interference. It\u2019s a clear sign of how far Trump is willing to go to export his extremist policies and attempt to bully allies into compliance.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump\u2019s counter-terror cuts will harm fight against far-right, experts warnWhat Happened: Trump has cut funding for key counter-terrorism research programs across agencies like DHS, the Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Justice. The moves include defunding the University of Maryland\u2019s START database, which tracked domestic extremism, hate crimes, and antisemitism.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t accidental\u2014it\u2019s by design. Trump is gutting efforts to fight far-right violence while pardoning January 6 rioters, and insurrectionists while putting loyalist Kash Patel in charge of the FBI to dismantle monitoring. Trump is protecting his allies, not the country.Source: The GuardianRussia, US start talks on rare earth metals projects in Russia, Putin envoy saysWhat Happened: Russia and the U.S. have started discussions on joint rare earth metals projects in Russia, according to Putin\u2019s envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Why It Matters: Despite Russia\u2019s genocidal war on Ukraine, Trump\u2019s only focus is on cutting deals with Moscow and showing fealty to Putin\u2014prioritizing profit and power over human rights and international law. His actions show a dangerous willingness to side with an aggressor for financial gain.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Says He \u2018Couldn\u2019t Care Less\u2019 About Tariff-Driven Auto Price HikesWhat Happened: Trump told NBC News he \u2018Couldn\u2019t Care Less\u2019 if foreign automakers raise prices in response to his new 25% tariffs, saying it would just push more people to buy American-made cars. He confirmed the tariffs would be permanent.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s dismissive stance on inflation and auto prices signals indifference to cost-of-living increases and global market disruptions.Source: CNBCTrump Funding Cuts Ripple Through Rural AmericaWhat Happened: Trump slashed key federal programs supporting rural agriculture, including the $500 million Local Food Purchase Assistance program, which helped food banks buy from local farmers. Small producers in West Virginia\u2014where Trump won 70% of the vote\u2014are now losing vital contracts and struggling to stay afloat.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s pro-farmer rhetoric, rural communities that heavily backed him are suffering from federal cuts. With states like West Virginia reliant on federal dollars for over half their budgets, the impact will be devastating.Source: Reuters Trump Weighs Broader, Higher TariffsWhat Happened: Trump is pushing for an aggressive new tariff plan ahead of an April 2 deadline, weighing a universal 20% tariff on nearly all trading partners or a \u201creciprocal\u201d model matching tariffs country by country. Industry-specific tariffs, including on critical minerals, are also under consideration.Why It Matters: The plan would dramatically reshape U.S. trade, spark price hikes, and escalate global economic tensions. Trump\u2019s goal is a \u201cbig and simple\u201d tariff regime\u2014despite warnings it will hurt consumers and trade partners.Source: Wall Street JournalA Wild Quarter for U.S. Stocks Sends Investors AbroadWhat Happened: After a strong 2024, U.S. stocks stumbled in early 2025 as Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff plans and a fading tech rally rattled markets. The S&P 500 fell 5.1%, while European markets gained momentum, drawing global investors away from the U.S.Why It Matters: Tariff uncertainty is shaking confidence in the American economy. With inflation worries rising and growth forecasts falling, investors are now eyeing Europe and other markets as safer bets\u2014signaling a potential long-term shift.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsProtesters Rally Against Elon Musk at Tesla Showrooms What Happened: Thousands of demonstrators gathered outside Tesla dealerships across the U.S. and Europe in a coordinated \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protest against Musk. Protesters, including lawmakers and celebrities, sought to damage Tesla\u2019s brand as backlash grows.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s Auto Tariffs Will Hurt His Working-Class SupportersWhat Happened: Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, which will disproportionately affect lower-income Americans. Most affordable new cars under $30,000 are built abroad, not in the U.S., and will become unaffordable or disappear from the market altogether. Used car prices are also expected to spike due to increased demand.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers80,000 \u2014 Number of jobs Trump plans to cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs.2 \u2014 $1 million checks Elon Musk handed out to Wisconsin voters at a Trump rally.20% \u2014 Tariff rate Trump is considering imposing on nearly all U.S. trading partners.5.1% \u2014 Drop in the S&P 500 during the first quarter of 2025 amid tariff chaos and economic uncertainty.$500 million \u2014 Federal program for local food purchases that Trump cut, devastating rural farmers.28 \u2014 Number of HHS branches being consolidated as part of RFK Jr.\u2019s plan to gut public health agencies.1,700+ \u2014 Death toll in Myanmar\u2019s earthquake, as U.S. delays response due to gutted foreign aid.6 \u2014 Times Trump has petitioned the Supreme Court in two months to override lower court rulings.50 \u2014 Senior IRS IT executives removed mid-tax season, risking delays and security breaches.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump\u2019s Next Moves on Social Security & Medicare \u2014 Are entitlement programs the next target in budget cuts?Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Emergency Appeals \u2014 Will the Court continue fast-tracking his agenda through the shadow docket?April 2 Tariff Announcement \u2014 Will Trump impose a blanket 20% tariff or target specific nations and industries?Union Pushback Against DOGE Firings \u2014 Will federal worker unions succeed in court or be gutted under Trump\u2019s executive order?Foreign Blowback Over DEI Crackdown \u2014 Will more U.S. allies push back against Trump\u2019s attempt to export his extremist culture war?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policy is raising prices for Americans and destabilizing global markets.

behind it, Russia? The Dark Enlightenment? Shifting coalitions of billionaires?  Simply the GOP? Theories abound.  What are it's ultimate objectives, will it succeed, can it be stopped, will the world ever return to normal?  No one really knows.  Right now the coup can be likened to a great pandemic that started in  America and is now spreading out.   We haven't unlocked the DNA of the virus yet so haven't yet found the cure and can't do much more than mask up and deal with symptoms.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 29-30</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and

Hands Out $1 Million Checks to Wisconsin Voters Despite Legal Challenge</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk handed out two $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters at a rally in Green Bay, moments after the state Supreme Court declined to block the scheme. Musk claimed the recipients were \\u201Cspokespeople\\u201D for his America PAC\\u2014a very bad attempt to dodge vote-buying laws. He\\u2019s already funneled over $20 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, calling it vital to Trump\\u2019s agenda and GOP control of Congress.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a brazen case of political bribery and attempting to influence a Tesla lawsuit. Offering cash to voters guts the principle of free and fair elections. Two courts and even a liberal-majority state Supreme Court refused to stop it, setting a dangerous precedent. If this stands, billionaires will escalate buying influence with direct payouts\\u2014shredding election integrity in plain sight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-musk-million-dollar-giveaway-cdea66e0dcbaa53dd183e1d10bee2b35\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Tesla\\u2019s Wisconsin Lawsuit, Elon Musk, and Brad Schimel</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Tesla sued the state of Wisconsin in January, challenging the state's \\u201Cfactory store\\u201D law, which bars vehicle manufacturers from directly selling cars. The lawsuit, initially filed in Outagamie County, was recently moved to Milwaukee County.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk has poured over $18 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who would influence Tesla\\u2019s legal fight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/03/25/teslas-wisconsin-lawsuit-elon-musk-and-brad-schimel-explained/82639129007/\\\\\\\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>The Trump family is cashing in on crypto. It\\u2019s creating problems in Congress.</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump\\u2019s company, World Liberty Financial, announced the launch of a new stablecoin, USD1, just as Republicans pushed crypto legislation through Congress. The move is complicating efforts to secure bipartisan support, especially from Democrats who are highlighting how Trump and his family are profiting from the bill.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The stablecoin rollout will benefit the Trump family financially from legislation they helped influence\\u2014creating an ethical minefield. Rep. Maxine Waters is now expected to oppose the bill unless it includes provisions to block Trump and Musk from issuing stablecoins. This is blatant corruption and Democrats must use all the tools to stop this.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/30/the-trump-family-is-cashing-in-on-crypto-its-creating-problems-in-congress-00255718\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Won\\u2019t Rule Out Third Term, Floats Workarounds in NBC Interview</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a phone interview, Trump said he\\u2019s \\u201Cnot joking\\u201D about the possibility of seeking a third term\\u2014despite the constitutional ban under the 22nd Amendment. Trump claimed \\u201Cthere are methods\\u201D for staying in power beyond two terms and floated scenarios like Vance taking office and handing it back to him. \\u201CA lot of people want me to do it,\\u201D Trump said, adding, \\u201CI like working.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is laying the groundwork to stay in power using identical tactics Putin used in Russia. This isn\\u2019t a joke\\u2014it\\u2019s a strategy to desensitize Americans to authoritarian rule. He\\u2019s testing the system for a power grab, and his sycophants are helping him stretch and break constitutional limits.

The order imposes a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, demands decertification of many voting machines, slashes cybersecurity support, and threatens federal funding to election offices that don\\u2019t comply.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is chaos by design. Trump\\u2019s order is a blatant power grab that will disenfranchise voters, overwhelm election systems, and sow mass confusion\\u2014all without legislation or legal authority. It\\u2019s the kind of move authoritarians use to break democracy from within. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-elections-voting-executive-order-2026-midterms-bd477e5ac8a7182f5aa01498ad79baaa\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>White House Takes Highly Unusual Step of Directly Firing Line Prosecutors</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Two career prosecutors in Los Angeles and Memphis were abruptly fired via a one-sentence email \\u201Con behalf of the president,\\u201D without explanation. Their dismissals reflect a highly unusual and direct intervention by the Trump White House into lower levels of the Justice Department.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move bypasses long-standing norms protecting career civil servants from political interference. Legal experts and DOJ veterans called it unprecedented, especially as Trump pushes the unitary executive theory, asserting total presidential control over the executive branch.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/line-prosecutors-fired-trump-doj.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Order Could Cripple Federal Worker Unions Fighting DOGE Cuts</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order removing union protections for over one million federal workers, citing national security. The move strips unions like AFGE of their ability to bargain or defend members just as they resist Musk\\u2019s mass purge.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct attack on organized labor in the federal government, targeting unions as part of Trump\\u2019s broader campaign of dismantling federal agencies. It severely weakens opposition to job cuts and consolidates executive power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/politics/federal-worker-unions-doge.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>DOGE Wants Businesses to Run Government Services \\u2018As Much As Possible\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk is driving a massive privatization push across federal agencies. From mail delivery and public lands to foreign aid and weather forecasting, the Trump regime is quietly transferring public functions to private firms\\u2014echoing both conservative and Silicon Valley ideologies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a hostile takeover of the U.S. government. Musk and Trump are trying to hand public services to the private sector\\u2014gutting accountability and shredding the social safety net. Essential agencies will collapse, and what\\u2019s left of American agencies will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/30/doge-privatize-government-usps-trump/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>U.S. Institute of Peace Staff Receive Termination Notices</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Nearly all staff at the U.S. Institute of Peace were abruptly terminated Friday. The mass firings follow Trump\\u2019s executive order to dismantle the congressionally funded organization and replace its board. Musk operatives have already taken control of USIP\\u2019s building, and affected employees received termination emails effective immediately.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another Trump-led purge of a congressionally established institution. The U.S. Institute of Peace, founded under Reagan, has spent decades promoting global conflict resolution. Shutting it down is a clear retreat from diplomacy\\u2014and a power grab that sidelines independent, peace-focused agencies.

In just two months, Trump has petitioned the Supreme Court court 6 times, including to resume mass deportations under an obscure 18th-century law and restrict transgender rights.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is attempting to use the Supreme Court to bulldoze judicial oversight, gut the separation of powers, and turn the Court into a political rubber stamp\\u2014 like he did with Congress.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-deportations-birthright-citizenship-0787cdf8bd36b964c7974ed032717ed4\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump is using the power of government to punish opponents.

Through executive orders, loyalist appointments, and threats of defunding, Trump has eroded norms and weakened the checks on presidential power.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is wielding executive power to punish critics, silence media, intimidate law firms, and choke off academic funding. Oversight bodies are being gutted, and many institutions are caving. With most checks collapsing, the judiciary is one of the last lines of defense\\u2014and it's under siege too.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/politics/trump-punish-opponents/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Secret Pentagon Memo on China, Homeland Has Heritage Fingerprints</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A leaked Defense Department memo, signed by Pete Hegseth, reorients the U.S. military around deterring China from seizing Taiwan\\u2014largely copying language from a 2024 Heritage Foundation report. The memo deprioritizes Russia and other global threats, shifting homeland defense responsibilities to the Pentagon and leaning heavily on allies abroad.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The memo exposes Trump\\u2019s aggressive overhaul of U.S. military priorities\\u2014and his regime\\u2019s deep reliance on the extremist, far-right Heritage Foundation, behind Project 2025. Extremist ideology is driving national defense strategy.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/29/secret-pentagon-memo-hegseth-heritage-foundation-china/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3>Trump quickly works to concentrate power and muzzle critical voices</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is rapidly consolidating power, targeting law firms, universities, journalists, and civil servants who oppose him. Backed by Elon Musk, he\\u2019s firing federal workers, revoking visas, defunding cultural groups, and threatening media access\\u2014using executive power to punish enemies, reward allies, and push voter suppression measures that defy the Constitution.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a systemic attack on the foundations of democracy. Trump is gutting independent institutions, purging dissent, and laying the groundwork to stay in power indefinitely. The judiciary is the last guardrail, and that\\u2019s under attack.

Ruffin, a sharp critic of Trump, was previously announced as the headliner. The WHCA claims it wants to \\u201Cavoid the politics of division.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is pure cowardice. Caving to Trump\\u2019s attacks on the press is censorship and not just appeasement but surrender. Every time the media folds, it strengthens a dictator.

Trump is attempting to silence independent journalism, banning critical outlets, and replacing real reporting with propaganda.

The case is before the Supreme Court, which is set to hear arguments next month.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This case could dismantle the long-standing separation between church and state.

The U.S. Embassy in Paris gave firms five days to confirm they don\\u2019t run DEI programs that violate U.S. anti-discrimination laws.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is nuts.
