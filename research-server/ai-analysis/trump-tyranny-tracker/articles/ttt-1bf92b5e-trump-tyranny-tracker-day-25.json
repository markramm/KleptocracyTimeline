  "content": "Attorney Emil Bove with Donald Trump at Manhattan Criminal Court last May. Photo: victor j. blue/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 13Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms. \ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Family Cashes In on Election WinWhat Happened: The Trumps have secured $80M+ through settlements, business deals, and media ventures. Melania landed a $40M Amazon deal for a documentary, while Trump settled lawsuits with Meta, X, and ABC, funneling millions into his presidential library. The family also expanded its crypto and stock ventures, with Trump Jr. joining corporate boards that saw stocks soar.Why It Matters: Trump is blurring the line between public office and personal profit, using his presidency to extract corporate payouts, settle lawsuits in his favor, and expand business ventures\u2014a level of corruption unseen in modern U.S. history.Source: Wall Street JournalOne Agency Tried to Regulate SpaceX. Now Its Fate Could Be in Elon Musk\u2019s HandsWhat Happened: The FAA grounded SpaceX\u2019s Starship after its January explosion and proposed fines for safety violations\u2014moves that Elon Musk slammed as \u201clawfare.\u201d Now Musk has the power to reshape or dismantle the FAA\u2019s Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which regulates SpaceX.Why It Matters: Musk overseeing the agency that regulates his own company is a huge conflict of interest, threatening safety oversight in commercial space industry. With AST already underfunded, cutting it further risks catastrophic launch failures, endangering both the public and space policy.Source: ProPublicaMusk Meets Modi Before Trump, Blurring Business & State AffairsWhat Happened: Elon Musk met with Indian PM Narendra Modi in the White House hours before Modi's official visit with Trump. Their talks centered on space, technology, and Starlink's entry into India\u2014a deal that directly benefits Musk.Why It Matters: Musk, a special government employee leading Trump\u2019s agency purge, is operating as an unelected diplomat\u2014using the White House to secure lucrative foreign deals. His conflict of interest mirrors Kremlin-style oligarchy, where business and government serve the elite over national interest.Source: ReutersAdams Opens Rikers to ICE After Meeting Trump\u2019s Border CzarWhat Happened: New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued an executive order allowing ICE agents into Rikers Island for criminal investigations, bypassing the city's sanctuary laws. The move follows a meeting with Trump\u2019s border czar, Thomas Homan, and comes days after DOJ ordered his corruption charges to be dropped at Trump\u2019s request. In a classic authoritarian move, the DOJ left the option to reopen the case, effectively maintaining leverage over the mayor. Why It Matters: The order marks a major shift in NYC\u2019s sanctuary policies, sparking backlash from the City Council and immigrant rights advocates. Adams aligning with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is a political quid pro quo.Source: The New York TimesAirbnb Co-Founder Joe Gebbia Joins Musk\u2019s DOGE TeamWhat Happened: Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb and Tesla board member, is set to join Elon Musk\u2019s FAKE DOGE. His exact role remains unclear, but sources say he will start soon.Why It Matters: Gebbia\u2019s appointment expands Musk\u2019s influence over the government, adding another Silicon Valley billionaire to Trump\u2019s inner circle. His recent shift to the Republican Party suggests a realignment among tech elites toward Trump\u2019s regime. This is blatant corruption, rewarding political loyalty over merit, further consolidating power among Trump\u2019s cronies.Source: The New York TimesMusk\u2019s DOGE Targets NASA Spending Amid Mass BuyoutsWhat Happened: Elon Musk is reviewing NASA\u2019s budget as hundreds of employees take buyouts under Trump\u2019s federal purge.Why It Matters: Musk controls NASA oversight while SpaceX holds $15B in contracts\u2014a blatant conflict of interest. Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsOPM Orders Mass Firing of Probationary Federal WorkersWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management directed federal agencies to fire all employees still in their probationary period\u2014a move that could impact up to 200,000 workers. The Trump regime claims this will \u201cstreamline\u201d government, meanwhile it\u2019s a politically driven purge.Why It Matters: This is a clear power grab, gutting the federal workforce to install loyalists and dismantle government functions. Legal expert call the mass firings illegal, arguing federal law requires individual case reviews. With agencies already carrying out the orders, legal challenges are expected.Source: The HillMusk Calls for Deleting U.S. Agencies, Less Foreign InterferenceWhat Happened: Speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai, Elon Musk called for eliminating entire U.S. agencies, slashing USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy, and reducing U.S. involvement abroad. He defended Trump\u2019s government purge, dismissed diversity efforts, and warned about AI dangers, while also discussing his new \"Dubai Loop\" project.Why It Matters: As a \u2018special government employee,\u2019 Musk\u2019s comments carry major policy weight. His push to dismantle agencies, restrict democracy efforts, and reduce global influence aligns with authoritarian regimes while escalating fears of unchecked power and government overreach.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s CFPB Purge: Hundreds of Staff Laid Off Amid Agency GuttingWhat Happened: Up to 100 more employees were fired from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau today, bringing the total layoffs this week to over 150. The cuts stem from Trump\u2019s executive order, with mass firings expected Friday that could eliminate 95% of the agency\u2019s workforce.Why It Matters: The CFPB, created after the 2008 financial crisis, protects consumers from predatory banks and financial scams. Its destruction leaves Wall Street unchecked, weakens protections for borrowers, and eliminates enforcement against corporate fraud. With USAID also dismantled, this marks another Trump-Musk power grab, gutting federal oversight in favor of unchecked corporate dominance.Source: NPRMusk Moves Into IRS, Sparking Fears Over Taxpayer DataWhat Happened: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) warned that Elon Musk is now embedded in the IRS, raising concerns about access to U.S. taxpayer data. Sources confirm unvetted DOGE operatives arrived at IRS headquarters, reviewing operations and directing senior executives to identify \u201cnon-essential\u201d contracts for termination.Why It Matters: This will jeopardize taxpayer privacy by granting Musk operatives access to sensitive financial data. The IRS purge also threatens to slow refunds and disrupt essential functions. With Musk already consolidating power over federal agencies, concerns mount over politicized financial surveillance.Source: The HillVA dismisses more than 1,000 employeesWhat Happened: The VA fired over 1,000 probationary employees, claiming a $98M savings for veterans\u2019 care.Why It Matters: Part of Trump\u2019s broader federal purge, sparking fears of privatization, understaffing, and service cuts.Source: VATrump Fires 3,400 Forest Service Workers, Fueling Wildfire CrisisWhat Happened: The U.S. Forest Service fired 3,400 employees, about 10% of its workforce, as part of the Trump\u2019s purge. The cuts hit wildfire prevention, watershed restoration, and forest management roles, leaving federal lands vulnerable.Why It Matters: The mass firings come as wildfires intensify nationwide, stripping the agency of crucial field workers. This will cripple fire mitigation efforts, making disasters worse. With Musk behind the cuts, critics call it a corporate-driven attack on environmental protection.Source: PoliticoMusk Slashes Education Department, Guts Research, Grants, and StaffWhat Happened: Musk abruptly terminated nearly $900 million in contracts, laid off at least 150 employees, and put 100 more on leave at the Education Department. Cuts hit data collection, research, and grant programs, crippling the agency\u2019s ability to track student outcomes and provide school resources.Why It Matters: Trump has vowed to shut down the Education Department, and Musk\u2019s rapid dismantling has crippled core functions. Schools will lose vital research tools, grants, and teacher training programs, while student loan data may be at risk. Source: The Washington PostTrump Orders U.S. Embassies to Prepare for Staff CutsWhat Happened: Trump has directed U.S. embassies worldwide to prepare for a 10% staff reduction, affecting both American diplomats and local employees. Simultaneously, 60 contractors in the State Department's Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor bureau were fired, with more cuts expected.Why It Matters: The diplomatic purge is part of Trump\u2019s effort to reshape foreign policy, ensuring total loyalty to his \"America First\" agenda. His executive order warns that failure to implement his policies could result in termination, raising alarms about politicizing diplomacy and weakening U.S. global influence.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTop NY Prosecutor, DOJ Officials Resign Over Trump Order to Drop Adams CaseWhat Happened: Acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and five senior Justice Department officials resigned after the Trump regime ordered them to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams. The case, alleging bribery and illegal donations, was abruptly moved to Washington for dismissal, triggering mass resignations.Why It Matters: Sassoon, a Republican, accused the DOJ of enabling a quid pro quo\u2014dropping the case in exchange for Adams\u2019 cooperation on Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. She stated she was \"confident\" Adams committed the charged crimes and more, revealing that prosecutors were preparing additional charges for destroying evidence, instructing others to destroy evidence, and providing false information to the FBI.Source: The Washington PostWhite House Purges U.S. Attorneys Amid DOJ, FBI UpheavalWhat Happened: The White House terminated at least 12 U.S. attorneys, including court-appointed prosecutors and those handling Jan. 6 cases. The move bypasses typical Justice Department procedures, with terminations ordered directly by Trump.Why It Matters: These terminations are part of a broader DOJ purge of federal law enforcement, highlighting political interference in prosecutions and Trump consolidating control over the justice system. FBI officials fear mass firings could cripple investigations for years.Source: NBC NewsCDC Still Hiding Health Data After Court OrderWhat Happened: Despite a federal judge's ruling, key CDC and federal health agency data remain offline, following Trump\u2019s executive order to scrub all mentions of \"gender.\" Pages on mpox vaccinations, transgender health data, and blood donation policies for gay men are still inaccessible, while some datasets have been partially restored.Why It Matters: The continued suppression of public health information blocks doctors and researchers from accessing critical data on disease prevention, mental health, and LGBTQ+ health policies. The regime\u2019s defiance of court orders is alarming and their actions highlight the politicization of public health and undermines scientific transparency.Source: CBS NewsMusk\u2019s Data Access at Labor Department Sparks AlarmWhat Happened: Elon Musk secured approval to use data-transfer software at the Labor Department, allowing large-scale data extraction. Federal labor unions sued, temporarily halting access amid privacy concerns.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked access to federal databases raises privacy, security, and conflict of interest concerns, especially with Musk\u2019s companies under federal scrutiny. Source: NBC NewsTop NIH Official Forced to Retire Under Trump RegimeWhat Happened: Dr. Lawrence Tabak, a decades-long top-ranking NIH official, was forced into early retirement late Tuesday. Tabak, who served as acting director during COVID-19 and the agency\u2019s ethics chief, had been excluded from key meetings before stepping down. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s targeting of top health officials weakens the independence of federal science agencies and highlights political interference in medical research. His removal comes amid court battles over federal research funding cuts, further jeopardizing scientific progress and public health oversight.Source: CBS NewsHegseth Invites Far-Right Activist on NATO TripWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth invited far-right activist Jack Posobiec on his NATO trip, alarming Pentagon officials who fear the military is being politicized. Posobiec is known for spreading conspiracies like \u201cPizzagate,\u201d Stop the Steal, and defending Jan. 6 rioters.Why It Matters: The signals military partisanship and risks undermining U.S. credibility abroad. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s regime is blocking mainstream media and reshaping NATO policy, further escalating tensions.Source: The Washington PostSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsWhite House Bars AP Reporter Over \u2018Gulf of America\u2019 DisputeWhat Happened: The White House blocked an AP reporter from attending Trump\u2019s news conference with Indian Prime Minister Modi after AP refused to adopt the regime\u2019s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. This follows days of AP reporters being barred from covering Trump events.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on press freedom, escalating Trump\u2019s authoritarian control over media access. By punishing outlets that refuse state-mandated terminology, the White House is setting a dangerous precedent of silencing independent journalism.Source: BloombergBove Opens Investigation Into Prosecutors and Puts Them On LeaveWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, prompting mass resignations. Acting U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, a Republican, stepped down, calling it a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to secure Adams\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. Before resigning, Sassoon revealed prosecutors had been preparing additional charges for Adams, including destroying evidence and instructing others to lie to the FBI.Why It Matters: Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, placed case prosecutors on administrative leave, launched internal investigations, and directed the DOJ to bar \u201cfurther targeting\u201d of Adams. This weaponizes justice to protect allies and intimidate prosecutors who uphold the law.Source: The New York Times (Read Bove\u2019s Letter)Trump\u2019s CDC Crackdown: Science, Messaging Under Tight ControlWhat Happened: Trump has seized control of CDC research and messaging, blocking publications without approval, erasing gender-related research, and purging health data. Scientists have been ordered to withdraw manuscripts that don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s executive orders.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian control over science, suppressing facts for political gain. Critical public health data is being censored, leaving Americans uninformed and in danger.Source: NPRTrump Purges Government Watchdogs, Consolidates PowerWhat Happened: Trump fired top officials overseeing ethics, whistleblower protections, and labor rights, including the heads of the Office of Government Ethics, Office of Special Counsel, and the Merit Systems Protection Board. These agencies investigate misconduct and protect federal workers. Lawsuits have already been filed, challenging the firings as illegal power grabs.Why It Matters: The purge removes key oversight of federal agencies, paving the way for unchecked executive power. This is a step toward authoritarian rule, ensuring no one is left to challenge illegal orders inside the government.Source: The Washington PostTrump Escalates War on the First AmendmentWhat Happened: Trump is weaponizing the federal government against the media, banning reporters, denying access, and threatening lawsuits. News outlets, including AP, CBS, and Meta, have paid settlements or handed over records, raising fears they are caving to pressure.Why It Matters: This is beyond past presidential media fights\u2014Trump is using government power to intimidate and punish the press, undermining free speech and a free press. This is an attack on democracy and a step toward authoritarian control of information.Source: The Detroit News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Admin Halts Thousands of Civil Rights Investigations in SchoolsWhat Happened: The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights froze 10,000+ investigations into disability access, racial discrimination, and harassment, shifting focus to Trump\u2019s priorities like banning transgender athletes and targeting DEI programs. Only 20 new cases have been opened since inauguration.Why It Matters: The freeze abandons students in crisis, stripping protections for marginalized groups while Trump moves to dismantle the Education Department. Civil rights enforcement is now weaponized for ideological battles over gender and race.Source: ProPublicaNational Park Service Erases Transgender References from Stonewall MonumentWhat Happened: The National Park Service removed transgender references from the Stonewall National Monument website, changing LGBTQ+ to LGB. The site now frames the Stonewall Uprising as a milestone for lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights, excluding transgender activists central to the movement.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate attempt to erase transgender history, undermining the contributions of trans activists in one of the most pivotal moments in LGBTQ+ rights. The move follows broader federal rollbacks on trans protections, and will not stop there. It is an orchestrated assault on LGBTQ+ recognition.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s Crackdown on Diversity Is a Civil Rights RollbackWhat Happened: Trump is purging DEI efforts, banning terms like \u201cracism\u201d from federal agencies, shutting down minority outreach, and investigating private diversity programs. His executive order eliminates affirmative action rules for federal contractors, reversing a policy dating back to Lyndon Johnson.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t about \u201cmerit\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about erasing civil rights progress and reinstating racial and gender hierarchies. Trump\u2019s agenda mirrors segregationist policies of the past, weaponizing civil rights laws against the communities they were meant to protect.Source: The New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial WatchTrump\u2019s 51st State Remark Sparks Outrage and ConfusionWhat Happened: Trump has repeatedly suggested annexing Canada as the 51st U.S. state, claiming the border between the two nations should be erased. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the idea but later acknowledged that Trump\u2019s insistence \u201cappears to be a real thing.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s annexation rhetoric raises major diplomatic concerns, drawing Canadian outrage and violating international norms. It is imperialistic, as Trump attempts to emulate Putin, and further damages U.S.-Canada relations at a time of trade and security tensions.Source: AP News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge Blocks Trump's Foreign Aid FreezeWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered the Trump regime to restore funding for foreign aid contractors, ruling that its abrupt 90-day freeze was unlawful.

The move follows a meeting with Trump\\u2019s border czar, Thomas Homan, and comes days after DOJ ordered his corruption charges to be dropped at Trump\\u2019s request. In a classic authoritarian move, the DOJ left the option to reopen the case, effectively maintaining leverage over the mayor. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The order marks a major shift in NYC\\u2019s sanctuary policies, sparking backlash from the City Council and immigrant rights advocates.

He defended Trump\\u2019s government purge, dismissed diversity efforts, and warned about AI dangers, while also discussing his new \\\\\\\"Dubai Loop\\\\\\\" project.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: As a \\u2018special government employee,\\u2019 Musk\\u2019s comments carry major policy weight.

The cuts stem from Trump\\u2019s executive order, with mass firings expected Friday that could eliminate 95% of the agency\\u2019s workforce.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The CFPB, created after the 2008 financial crisis, protects consumers from predatory banks and financial scams. Its destruction leaves Wall Street unchecked, weakens protections for borrowers, and eliminates enforcement against corporate fraud.

The cuts hit wildfire prevention, watershed restoration, and forest management roles, leaving federal lands vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The mass firings come as wildfires intensify nationwide, stripping the agency of crucial field workers.

Simultaneously, 60 contractors in the State Department's Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor bureau were fired, with more cuts expected.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The diplomatic purge is part of Trump\\u2019s effort to reshape foreign policy, ensuring total loyalty to his \\\\\\\"America First\\\\\\\" agenda.

The move bypasses typical Justice Department procedures, with terminations ordered directly by Trump.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: These terminations are part of a broader DOJ purge of federal law enforcement, highlighting political interference in prosecutions and Trump consolidating control over the justice system.
