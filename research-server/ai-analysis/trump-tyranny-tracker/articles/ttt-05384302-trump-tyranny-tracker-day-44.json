(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 4Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Selling Access: Business Leaders Pay Millions for Mar-a-Lago DinnersWhat Happened: Business executives are paying up to $5 million for private meetings with Trump and $1 million per seat at exclusive Mar-a-Lago dinners. These high-priced events, linked to the pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc., draw corporate elites\u2014including tech leaders\u2014seeking influence in his regime.Why It Matters: This unprecedented pay-to-play scheme raises is blatant corruption, blurring the line between Trump\u2019s presidency and his private business. Corporate interests are buying direct access to policy decisions, with little transparency on where the money is going.Source: WIREDMusk\u2019s Operatives Rake in Six-Figure Salaries While Slashing Government JobsWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s operatives are drawing large taxpayer-funded salaries while gutting agencies and purges across federal agencies. Some employees earn up to $195,200 annually. Despite Musk\u2019s earlier claims that his unvetted operatives\u2019 work was unpaid, funding has surged to $40 million while transparency remains nonexistent.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are justifying mass government layoffs under the guise of \u201cefficiency\u201d while paying their unvetted operatives top-dollar salaries. This double standard highlights cronyism, conflicts of interest, and Musk\u2019s unchecked power over the federal government.Source: WIREDEthical Concerns Surround Sen. Joni Ernst\u2019s Relationships With Top Military Officials Who Lobbied Her CommitteeWhat Happened: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had romantic relationships with two military officials responsible for lobbying Congress. One was Maj. Gen. Christopher Finerty, an Air Force legislative liaison under investigation for inappropriate relationships, and the other was a Navy official. Why It Matters: Ernst's close personal ties to military lobbyists highlight conflicts of interest in defense policymaking. While Senate rules do not explicitly prohibit such relationships, they undermine public trust and create potential avenues for improper influence over military funding and policy decisions.Source: ProPublicaTrump Moves to Sell Off Federal Buildings, Including FBI and DOJ HeadquartersWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to sell over 400 federal properties, including the FBI, DOJ, VA, and Labor Department headquarters. The General Services Administration claims the move could save over $430 million annually and reduce \"underutilized\" office space.Why It Matters: Selling critical government buildings\u2014including courthouses and law enforcement hubs\u2014 raises concerns about national security, workforce displacement, and the privatization of federal assets. Source: CNNSenate Repeals Biden-Era Crypto Tax Rule, Benefiting Trump and InsidersWhat Happened: The Senate voted 70-27 to repeal a rule requiring DeFi platforms to report customer transactions to the IRS. The measure, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, is expected to become law.Why It Matters: This unprecedented repeal under the Congressional Review Act benefits the crypto industry and could cost the U.S. $3.9 billion in tax revenue while weakening efforts to track illicit financial activities. This will enable corruption, benefiting Trump, his family, and political insiders with financial stakes in the sector.Source: The Wall Street JournalCommerce Overhauls Rural Internet Program, Boosting Starlink\u2019s FundingWhat Happened: Trump is revising the $42.5 billion Internet for All program, making Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink eligible for significantly more rural broadband funding. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s changes will remove Biden-era fiber-optic preferences, directing $10 billion to $20 billion to Starlink\u2014up from an expected $4.1 billion. Why It Matters: This benefits Musk\u2019s companies while sidelining traditional broadband providers. It exemplifies Trump\u2019s pattern of governance, favoring loyalists and billionaires while consolidating power with oligarchic influence and corruption.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump Drops CFPB Lawsuit Against Major Banks Over Zelle FraudWhat Happened: The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, effectively shuttered by Trump last month, dropped a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo over their failure to protect consumers from fraud on the Zelle payment platform.Why It Matters: The lawsuit sought accountability for fraud that cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The decision to drop the case highlights regulatory capture as Trump dismantles consumer protections in favor of major financial institutions. The move follows broader efforts to weaken oversight, including gutting the CFPB and rolling back financial regulations.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Plans to Cut Up to Half of IRS WorkforceWhat Happened: The IRS is drafting plans to lay off up to 45,000 employees\u2014half of its workforce\u2014through layoffs, attrition, and buyouts under Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s government purge. The cuts would gut tax enforcement, which will cripple revenue collection and efforts to crack down on wealthy tax dodgers.Why It Matters: Slashing the IRS workforce will weaken tax enforcement, reduce government revenue, and allow the ultra-wealthy to evade taxes more easily. Source: Associated PressTrump Moves to Dismantle Department of EducationWhat Happened: Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced the department\u2019s \u201cfinal mission,\u201d outlining plans to dismantle the agency. Her memo calls for cutting DEI programs, restricting curriculum topics, and expanding school vouchers. Trump is expected to sign an executive order for the department\u2019s shutdown.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s agenda aims to eliminate federal education oversight, gut programs like Title I and Pell Grants, and redirect public funds to private and religious schools. Without congressional action, he could still cripple the department by slashing its funding and authority.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s Federal Shake-Up Sparks Election Security ConcernsWhat Happened: Trump has \u201cpaused\u201d the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s election security efforts. 17 CISA election security workers have already been put on administrative leave.Why It Matters: Election experts warn that these disruptions will weaken U.S. election security, making it more vulnerable to cyber threats and foreign interference. CISA played a critical role in safeguarding election infrastructure and countering disinformation.Source: The HillTrump Disbands Expert Panels on Economic DataWhat Happened: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disbanded two expert panels\u2014the Federal Economic Statistics Advisory Committee and the Bureau of Economic Analysis Advisory Committee\u2014that advised the government on inflation, employment, and GDP data. Why It Matters: This will weaken the quality of U.S. economic data by eliminating expert input, making it intentionally harder to track economic trends accurately. The decision follows Lutnick\u2019s controversial push to strip government spending from GDP reports, raising concerns that the regime is manipulating economic data\u2014 as seen in authoritarian regimes.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsHere Comes Trump's Privatization of the Social Security AdministrationWhat Happened: A leaked email from SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek outlines plans to outsource \"nonessential functions\" and cut 7,000 jobs, close 45 field offices, and consolidate operations. Former Commissioner Martin O\u2019Malley warns these changes could collapse the agency and disrupt benefits.Why It Matters: Trump and Elon Musk are gutting the SSA under the guise of efficiency, but experts say it\u2019s a backdoor plan to privatize Social Security, risking delayed payments for millions of seniors.Source: Common DreamsTrump Installs Loyalist to Dismantle Foreign Aid AgencyWhat Happened: The White House fired the president and board of the Inter-American Foundation and installed Trump loyalist Peter Marocco as the agency's sole leader. Elon Musk\u2019s operatives immediately began shutting down programs, terminating local contractors, and requesting access to grantee data.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting U.S. foreign aid, fueling chaos in Latin America and across the globe, and handing power to Russia and China. By ignoring Congress and ceding influence, Trump is escalating global instability\u2014disastrous for the U.S. and beyond.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsRepublicans Advised to Avoid In-Person Town Halls Amid Viral ConfrontationsWhat Happened: The National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP lawmakers to avoid in-person town halls after multiple heated confrontations over mass layoffs went viral. Chairman Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) suggested lawmakers use alternative methods to reach constituents, echoing GOP strategies from 2017, when protests erupted over health care cuts.Why It Matters: Facing backlash for gutting the government, Republicans are running scared, dodging accountability before the election. They know voters are angry\u2014so they\u2019re hiding. Source: NBC NewsTrump threatens funding cut to colleges allowing 'illegal protests'What Happened: Trump threatened colleges that allowing \u201cillegal protests\u201d could lead to the loss of federal funding. He also threatened to deport foreign students and imprison or expel American students who participate in protests. Why It Matters: This is a blatant attack on free speech and academic independence, using state power to criminalize dissent. Today, it\u2019s framed as fighting antisemitism\u2014tomorrow, it will be used to silence anyone who opposes the regime.Source: PoliticoBowser Signals D.C. Will Paint Over BLM Plaza After GOP Funding ThreatsWhat Happened: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced plans to repaint Black Lives Matter Plaza after a Republican-led bill threatened to cut $185 million in federal transportation funds unless the city erased and renamed the site to \"Liberty Plaza.\"Why It Matters: The move highlights the authoritarian tactics of Trump-aligned Republicans, using financial coercion to erase symbols of racial justice and suppress dissent. Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsPentagon Eliminates Civilian Protection Offices in Trump\u2019s Military OverhaulWhat Happened: Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered the closure of the Pentagon\u2019s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office, along with the Civilian Protection Center of Excellence. Over 160 positions focused on preventing civilian casualties in U.S. combat operations will be eliminated, including advisory roles at operational commands like Central Command and Africa Command.Why It Matters: This dismantles key safeguards to prevent civilian harm in military operations, marking a dangerous shift in Pentagon policy. This will lead to increased civilian casualties and violations of international law, reflecting the Trump regime\u2019s push for a more aggressive, less-regulated military strategy.Source: The New York TimesRFK Jr sparks alarm after backing vitamins to treat measles amid outbreakWhat Happened: Health Secretary RFK Jr. faced intense backlash after promoting vitamins instead of vaccines in response to a measles outbreak in Texas, which resulted in the first U.S. measles death in a decade. Kennedy called vaccination a \"personal choice\" and focused on nutrition and vitamin A in an opinion piece for Fox News, failing to endorse the 97% effective measles vaccine.Why It Matters: Kennedy\u2019s stance undermines public health efforts and will fuel vaccine hesitancy, worsening an outbreak that has already infected 146 people and hospitalized over 20. Experts warn his messaging creates false equivalency between vaccines and vitamins, endangering children's lives.Source: The GuardianTrump Launches Fresh Attacks on Abortion RightsWhat Happened: Trump moved to drop a lawsuit defending emergency abortion access in Idaho and back South Carolina\u2019s attempt to block Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood. The DOJ will withdraw from a case challenging Idaho\u2019s near-total abortion ban while also seeking to argue before the Supreme Court in support of South Carolina\u2019s anti-Planned Parenthood policy.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s actions threaten emergency abortion access and could cut funding for critical reproductive health services, including STI testing and birth control. These moves further cement his regime\u2019s anti-abortion agenda.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Funding Freeze Rattles Domestic Violence NonprofitsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s funding freeze on \u201cwoke\u201d federal programs has hit domestic violence and sexual assault nonprofits. The DOJ\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women removed all open grant opportunities from its website, directing applicants not to finalize funding requests. Why It Matters: Nonprofits that rely on OVW grants to provide emergency shelter, legal aid, and crisis services warn that any cuts will destabilize lifesaving programs, disproportionately harming marginalized communities. Source: Politico\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchState Department Halts Global Air Pollution MonitoringWhat Happened: Trump abruptly ended a State Department program that used air quality sensors at more than 80 U.S. embassies and consulates to monitor global pollution levels. The program provided critical air quality data in regions with limited or unreliable monitoring. Officials cited \"budget constraints\" for the decision.Why It Matters: The move eliminates a key source of independent pollution data, undermining public health efforts worldwide. The decision aligns with Trump\u2019s broader extremist agenda to dismantle environmental monitoring and climate science, benefiting polluting industries while keeping the public in the dark about hazardous air conditions.Source: The Washington PostRFK Jr.\u2019s Top HHS Spokesperson Abruptly ResignsWhat Happened: Thomas Corry, the top communications official under HHS Secretary RFK Jr., resigned just two weeks after taking office. His departure followed RFK Jr.'s controversial response to a measles outbreak in Texas, where he downplayed its severity and lied about the number of deaths.Why It Matters: Corry\u2019s abrupt exit highlights internal chaos at HHS under RFK Jr.\u2019s leadership, with frustrations over canceled vaccine meetings, stalled research funding, and mishandled public health crises. His departure raises further concerns about Trump\u2019s radical overhaul of federal health agencies.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial Watch and Geopolitical WatchUK MPs Condemn JD Vance\u2019s \u2018Deeply Disrespectful\u2019 CommentsWhat Happened: Vance sparked outrage after dismissing a proposed Anglo-French peacekeeping force for Ukraine, referring to \u201c20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d UK officials were enraged and swiftly condemned the remarks, calling them insulting to British and French soldiers who fought alongside the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan.Why It Matters: Vance\u2019s dismissive rhetoric weakens already strained U.S.-UK relations at a time when Western allies are working to bolster security guarantees for Ukraine. His remarks reinforce growing concerns about Trump\u2019s America (Russia) First approach and hostility toward U.S. allies while cozying up to dictator thugs.Source: The GuardianPoll: 73% of French People No Longer See U.S. as an AllyWhat Happened: A new Elab/BFMTV poll reveals that 73% of French citizens believe the U.S. is no longer an ally of France. The findings reflect growing skepticism toward U.S. foreign policy under Trump, particularly in the wake of his hostility toward NATO, tariffs on European goods, and strained relations with key allies.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s diplomatic isolationism is eroding longstanding transatlantic ties. As European leaders push for greater defense autonomy, this shift will undermine NATO cohesion and further distance the U.S. from its historical allies while Trump aligns with Russia.Source: Kethevane Gorjestani (France 24) on X\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchPutin Played a Long Game. It\u2019s Starting to Pay Off.What Happened: Putin's long-standing strategy to weaken Western influence is bearing fruit as the U.S. shifts its foreign policy stance under Trump. The White House has paused military aid to Ukraine, distanced itself from NATO allies, and cozied up to Russia. Moscow sees this as a major strategic victory, with Russian officials expressing surprise at how quickly Trump has altered foreign policy alignments.Why It Matters: The Kremlin is now in a stronger position to reshape the global order, with Trump echoing Russian propaganda and disinformation about Ukraine and prioritizing disengagement from Europe. The diplomatic realignment threatens to undermine NATO, embolden Russia\u2019s bloody expansionist ambitions, and further isolate Ukraine in its war for survival.Source: The Wall Street JournalPutin Sees Trump\u2019s Ukraine Aid Freeze as a VictoryWhat Happened: Following Trump\u2019s suspension of military aid to Ukraine, the Kremlin welcomed the decision, viewing it as a fracturing of Western unity. Russian media is amplifying Trump\u2019s Oval Office humiliation of Zelenskyy, reinforcing Kremlin narratives. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s NATO skepticism and retreat from Ukraine are weakening Western resolve. Sensing weakness, Putin may escalate and broaden military operations, knowing he has a supportive ally in Trump. Trump is carrying out a Russia First policy\u2014domestically and abroad.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Tariffs Could Raise U.S. Fuel PricesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect Tuesday, including a 10% levy on Canadian energy and a 25% tariff on Mexican energy. Given that the U.S. imports more oil from Canada than any other country, analysts warn that fuel prices could rise within the next few weeks.Why It Matters: Experts predict gasoline prices in New England could jump by 15\u201325 cents per gallon, along with potential spikes in heating oil costs. The tariffs may also impact refineries that rely on Canadian crude oil, adding uncertainty to energy markets and increasing costs for consumers.Source: The HillStagflation Fears Surge as Trump Tariffs Hit EconomyWhat Happened: Concerns over stagflation\u2014rising inflation combined with slowing growth\u2014are mounting as Trump\u2019s tariffs disrupt markets and consumer sentiment plunges. The Atlanta Fed now projects a 2.8% economic contraction for Q1, the worst drop since the COVID-19 shutdown.Why It Matters: The stock market sell-off, declining factory activity, and weaker consumer spending signal economic turmoil. Trump\u2019s trade war and immigration crackdown are fueling inflation while choking growth, reviving fears of a 1970s-style economic crisis.Source: CNBCTrump\u2019s Trade War Wallops Stock MarketWhat Happened: The Dow Jones plunged 670 points on Tuesday, marking a two-day loss of over 1,300 points, after Trump imposed tariffs. The S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, and Nasdaq fell 0.4%, wiping out all gains since Election Day.Why It Matters: Markets are reacting negatively to Trump\u2019s aggressive trade war, with investors fearing higher costs, slower growth, and economic instability. Consumer sentiment is falling, inflation is plateauing, and businesses are warning of severe disruptions from Trump\u2019s policies.Source: The HillIllinois Farmers Fear Losing Corn Sales as Trump Tariffs Spark RetaliationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican imports have Illinois farmers worried that Mexico, the world\u2019s top corn importer, will retaliate by turning to South American suppliers.Why It Matters: Illinois farmers rely heavily on Mexican buyers, particularly those using rail links to ship corn over 1,000 miles south. With grain prices already low and input costs rising, any loss of exports could further strain the U.S. agricultural sector. Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Tariffs Threaten Consumer Prices, Agriculture, and Auto IndustryWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs hit major imports like cars, auto parts, electronics, clothing, tequila, and agricultural products\u2014prompting retaliation from trading partners.Why It Matters: These tariffs will raise prices on everyday goods, from avocados to cars, fueling inflation and economic instability. Farmers and manufacturers fear severe losses as trading partners retaliate, echoing the disruptions of Trump\u2019s first trade war.Source: Associated PressCar Prices Poised for $12,000 Surge on Trump\u2019s New TariffsWhat Happened: The Anderson Economic Group found that Trump\u2019s tariffs could add $4,000 to crossover vehicles, $9,000 to SUVs, and up to $12,000 for EVs. Additional steel and aluminum tariffs could push costs even higher.Why It Matters: The tariffs will significantly increase car prices, making vehicles less affordable for consumers. Retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico could further escalate costs, harming the auto industry and driving inflation.Source: BloombergAmerican Businesses Reel as Trump\u2019s Tariffs Take EffectWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs are causing companies relying on foreign materials and labor to scramble, adjust pricing, absorb costs, or halt investments.Why It Matters: The tariffs are expected to cost the average U.S. family $1,200 a year while disrupting supply chains and slowing business growth. The uncertainty has already paused investments and hiring, pushing businesses into survival mode instead of expansion.Source: NPRTarget CEO Warns of Price Increases Due to Trump TariffsWhat Happened: Target and Best Buy warned consumers to expect immediate price hikes following Trump\u2019s tariffs. Target CEO Brian Cornell said fresh produce prices could rise \"in the next couple of days,\" while Best Buy anticipates higher costs for electronics.Why It Matters: The tariffs are triggering inflationary pressure on everyday goods, from food to electronics.

Why It Matters: Veterans make up nearly one-third of the federal workforce, and many rely on these jobs due to service-related disabilities.

last night:</span></p><p><span>\"With his tariffs, his embrace of autocrats and his contempt for democracy at home and abroad, Trump is simultaneously dismantling the national security and free trade structures that made America the richest and most powerful nation in history. His power grabs since returning to the White House are threatening the Constitution and the rule of law \u2014 and validating fears of the founders, who dreaded that a president might one day try to be a king.\"</span></p><p><span>Both eloquent and accurate.  One wonders why the Democrats are so spineless in their resistance to tyranny?  Why they seem so unable to counter the tyrant?  Is there no national level check to the would-be king?</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div

Christopher Finerty, an Air Force legislative liaison under investigation for inappropriate relationships, and the other was a Navy official. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Ernst's close personal ties to military lobbyists highlight conflicts of interest in defense policymaking.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\\u2019s changes will remove Biden-era fiber-optic preferences, directing $10 billion to $20 billion to Starlink\\u2014up from an expected $4.1 billion. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This benefits Musk\\u2019s companies while sidelining traditional broadband providers.
