  "content": "The Pentagon is seen on Sunday, Aug. 27, 2023, in Washington. | Carolyn Kaster/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 21Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsCrypto Knocks on the Door of a Banking World That Shut It OutWhat Happened: With Trump\u2019s pro-bitcoin agenda, crypto firms like Circle, BitGo, and Coinbase are seeking bank charters to move deeper into the U.S. financial system. The White House\u2019s crypto pivot, coupled with legislation to regulate stablecoins, is paving the way for crypto companies to issue currency, take deposits, and offer loans.Why It Matters: Just two years after FTX\u2019s collapse, Trump is gutting safeguards and pushing a crypto-finance merger with no oversight\u2014fueling fears of money laundering and conflicts tied to his family\u2019s digital currency ventures.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Raised $239 Million for Inauguration, More Than Doubling His Own RecordWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s second inauguration raked in $239 million\u2014more than double his 2017 haul\u2014with donations from over 140 major corporations and wealthy allies, including JPMorgan, Meta, Ripple, and friends of Elon Musk.Why It Matters: The surge in corporate donations shows Trump\u2019s pay-to-play politics is back in full swing\u2014and the White House is open for business. It blurs ethical lines and invites influence peddling.Source: New York TimesTrumps Host White House Easter Egg Roll With Corporate SponsorshipsWhat Happened: The White House Easter Egg Roll returned Monday with a corrupt Trump twist: corporate sponsors like Amazon, Meta, and YouTube paid up to $200,000 for branding perks and access, replacing traditional public support.Why It Matters: This shatters another norm\u2014transforming a taxpayer-funded family tradition into a corrupt corporate-sponsored spectacle, blurring the line between governance, profiteering, and propaganda.Source: CBS NewsThis Chicken Company Paid Over $100 Million in Fines for Fixing Prices, Then Gave $5 Million to Trump\u2019s InaugurationWhat Happened: Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, the poultry giant that pleaded guilty to price-fixing in 2021, was the top donor to Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration, contributing $5 million. The company is controlled by two Brazilian billionaire brothers tied to international bribery. Trump recently paused enforcement of the anti-corruption law they broke.Why It Matters: The donation raises serious concerns about pay-to-play politics and foreign influence. Ethics watchdogs warn it bears the hallmarks of a corrupt quid pro quo\u2014especially as Trump dismantles anti-bribery laws that once held the company and its billionaire owners accountable.Source: NOTUS\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Calls Powell a \u2018Major Loser.\u2019 3 Ways He Could Sideline the Fed ChairWhat Happened: Trump escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a \u201cmajor loser\u201d and signaling that the White House is exploring legal avenues to remove or sideline him. Trump wants preemptive rate cuts despite rising inflation fears, and his team is reviewing options to oust Powell.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to undermine the Fed\u2019s independence threatens the core of U.S. monetary policy. Politicizing the central bank would erode market trust, fuel inflation, and send both the U.S. and global economies into chaos.Source: Barron\u2019sTrump Blasts Supreme Court While Arguing Trials for Migrants \u2018Not Possible\u2019What Happened: Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court for halting deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act, claiming it's \u201cnot possible\u201d to give trials to migrants accused of gang ties. Why It Matters: Trump is openly rejecting due process and attacking the authority of the Supreme Court\u2014escalating a constitutional crisis.Source: The HillTrump\u2019s Directive to Ban Barcode Vote Tabulation Could Cost States MillionsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new executive order bans the use of barcode- and QR-code-based vote tabulation, a system used widely in both red and blue states to quickly and accurately count ballots. The mandate leaves election officials scrambling to assess whether they need to replace expensive voting machines, many of which are still relatively new.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s barcode voting ban could cost states hundreds of millions and is intended to sow chaos and undermine election integrity in the upcoming 2026 election. It\u2019s legally dubious, hard to enforce, and risks violating voter privacy\u2014especially for disabled voters. Source: NOTUS\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsJustice Dept. Agrees to Let DOGE Access Sensitive Immigration Case DataWhat Happened: The Justice Department quietly authorized a half-dozen Musk operatives to access ECAS, a highly restricted system tracking millions of immigration cases, including personal data, court records, and law enforcement history.Why It Matters: This hands unvetted Musk operatives with no legal oversight unprecedented access to sensitive data, signaling a dangerous new phase in Trump\u2019s surveillance and immigration agenda\u2014one that threatens privacy, due process, and the rights of even legal immigrants.Source: The Washington PostWhite House Assesses Ways to Persuade Women to Have More ChildrenWhat Happened: Trump is quietly reviewing proposals to reverse declining U.S. birth rates, including $5,000 baby bonuses, menstrual cycle education, and reserving scholarships for married applicants. The push, backed by Musk, Vance, and Project 2025 leaders, reflects a growing pronatalist movement shaping federal family policy.Why It Matters: Like Russia, Trump\u2019s team is pushing policies that reward marriage and childbirth while gutting the programs families actually need. If Republicans cared about birth rates, they would vote for funding child care, family leave, and health care. Source: New York TimesInterior Gives Power to DOGE-Linked OfficialWhat Happened: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum quietly handed sweeping authority to Tyler Hassen, a Musk-linked operative, allowing him to direct funding, oversee personnel decisions, and reorganize entire bureaus under the guise of \u201cefficiency.\u201dWhy It Matters: This puts a Musk operative in control of massive federal resources, accelerating their takeover of government functions and enabling political purges and restructuring with no oversight.Source: The HillTrump Threatens to Pull Another $1B in Harvard FundingWhat Happened: As part of his escalating war on universities, Trump is threatening to cut an additional $1 billion in federal health research funding from Harvard. This follows a $2.2 billion freeze after the school refused demands to gut its admissions policies, eliminate DEI programs, and allow federal oversight.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal funding to try and force private universities into ideological submission\u2014gutting academic freedom and bending institutions to his political will. This is textbook authoritarianism to control the curriculum and silence dissent. Source: The HillTrump Ups Its Attacks on Maine, Targeting Offshore Wind ProjectsWhat Happened: Trump abruptly issued stop work orders for three federally funded offshore wind research projects at the University of Maine, freezing over $12.6 million in grants. Despite full compliance, the orders came without explanation and coincide with Trump\u2019s ongoing retaliation against Gov. Janet Mills.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to punish Maine for not falling in line with his extremist agenda. He\u2019s sabotaging climate research and gutting clean energy innovation because Gov. Mills is pushing back against the regime.Source: NOTUSSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsDOGE Is Building a Master Database to Surveil and Track ImmigrantsWhat Happened: Musk is building a vast surveillance database at DHS, merging IRS, Social Security, immigration, biometric, and voter data. Whistleblowers say DOGE is bypassing privacy laws, while oversight offices are being gutted\u2014clearing the way for real-time tracking and profiling of immigrants.Why It Matters: This is the infrastructure for a mass surveillance state\u2014targeted first at immigrants, but expandable to anyone Trump and his allies deem enemies. It\u2019s authoritarian, invasive, and illegal. Musk is building the tools for political repression, and if left unchecked, this will be expanded to all Americans.Source: WIRED\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsU.S. Citizen Detained by Immigration Agents for 10 Days in ArizonaWhat Happened: Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen from New Mexico, was detained by immigration agents in Arizona for 10 days after reportedly being accused of illegal entry. He and his girlfriend were visiting family in Tucson when agents arrested him. Why It Matters: This underscores concerns over the growing wrongful detention of U.S. citizens. Civil rights groups warn that flawed databases, coerced confessions, and the regime\u2019s disregard for due process are already leading to unlawful detentions\u2014and could soon result in the disappearances of Americans.Source: NBC NewsHow to Protect Yourself From Phone Searches at the U.S. BorderWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s deportation crackdown has triggered a spike in digital searches at U.S. borders, with visa holders and foreign visitors especially targeted. CBP can inspect phones, social media, and stored data without a warrant\u2014and refusing may lead to detention, deportation, or device seizure.Why It Matters: The digital privacy of immigrants, journalists, and activists is in danger. With ICE and Musk weaponizing federal databases and Trump pressuring agencies to flag dissenters, even lawful travelers are at risk of being interrogated or denied entry based on their phone content, messages, or online activity. A classic authoritarian tactic.Source: WIREDInternational Student Has Visa Revoked Days After Getting Job Offer and Work PermitWhat Happened: Over 1,000 international students, including a recent Boston University hire, have had visas suddenly revoked\u2014some just days after receiving work permits. Immigration lawyers say AI-driven targeting may be behind the crackdowns, often without clear cause or due process.Why It Matters: The crackdown is gutting America\u2019s talent pipeline, driving out skilled graduates and choking innovation. It sends a chilling message: even with legal status, you're not safe. Students and immigrants are the testing ground for a surveillance state that\u2019s being built to eventually target everyone.Source: CBS NewsDetainee Recounts Near-Deportation Amid Supreme Court PauseWhat Happened: Eduardo Daboin Rall, a Venezuelan national with no criminal record, was among 28 ICE detainees loaded onto a bus for disappearance to El Salvador. The operation was abruptly halted mid-journey after DHS received a call to cancel, and later that night, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the removals.Why It Matters: Daboin Rall\u2019s story reveals the chaos inside ICE as Trump\u2019s mass disappearance machine runs on fear, secrecy, and unchecked power. Detainees were pressured to sign untranslated documents and given no reason for their removal\u2014stripped of rights and due process.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchSchiff Asks the National Archives to Review the Trump Officials Use of SignalWhat Happened: Senator Adam Schiff is calling for an investigation into Trump officials\u2019 use of encrypted messaging apps like Signal to discuss sensitive national security matters. This includes reports that Hegseth shared classified strike plans in unsecure group chats with family members. Schiff has urged the National Archives to preserve these communications and demanded that Marco Rubio recuse himself from any oversight related to the inquiry.Why It Matters: The revelations raise grave national security concerns\u2014potential breaches, destroyed records, and a lawless inner circle operating in the dark. With adversaries watching and allies losing trust, the risk is clear: critical intelligence could dry up, weakening America\u2019s global standing and endangering lives.Source: New York TimesPentagon turmoil deepens: Top Hegseth aide leaves postWhat Happened: Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, was ousted, joining three other top aides pushed out this week amid an escalating leak scandal. The Pentagon front office is now leaderless, with no chief of staff, deputy, or senior adviser, as internal dysfunction, chaos, and distrust deepen.Why It Matters: The Pentagon is in meltdown mode. Hegseth has lost control, surrounded by infighting and firings. National security is being run by amateurs and loyalists, and the cracks are widening fast. Our adversaries and allies are watching as America\u2019s military leadership descends into chaos, raising serious questions about U.S. readiness and global stability.Source: PoliticoGovernment Cancels Disinformation Grants in Disinformation-Filled StatementWhat Happened: The National Science Foundation terminated over 50 research grants, worth $9 million, focused on disinformation, citing Trump\u2019s executive order on \u201cfree speech.\u201d Researchers, including Vanderbilt\u2019s Lisa Fazio, were abruptly defunded for work studying how false beliefs form and spread.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing \u201cfree speech\u201d rhetoric to suppress scientific research on disinformation, effectively silencing those studying how propaganda spreads in a democracy.Source: Mother JonesNew images could change cancer diagnostics, but ICE detained the Harvard scientist who analyzes themWhat Happened: Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born Harvard scientist working on breakthrough cancer research, was detained by ICE in February after failing to declare frog embryo samples at Boston Logan Airport. Why It Matters: Petrova is the sole expert capable of decoding data from a pioneering microscope that could transform cancer and longevity research. Her detention not only halts vital scientific breakthroughs but also underscores how Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is actively sabotaging America\u2019s role as a global leader in research and innovation.Source: NBC NewsThe Scramble to Save Rural Health Care From DOGEWhat Happened: In rural Alabama, Cahaba Medical Care\u2014a lifeline for some of the state\u2019s poorest communities\u2014is on the brink as Musk slashes key federal grants. Among them is a $175 million residency training program that brought much-needed doctors to areas long ignored by the healthcare system.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s purge of rural health funding is gutting critical care in some of the most underserved parts of America. Canceling them means fewer doctors, more untreated illnesses, and rising mortality in regions already struggling. Source: The AtlanticHHS Plans to Cut Funds Used to Investigate Abuse at Group HomesWhat Happened: A leaked HHS budget draft reveals plans to defund protection and advocacy services for people with developmental disabilities, including programs that investigate abuse in group homes. The move is part of a broader effort by RFK Jr. and Project 2025 architects to dismantle decades-old disability rights infrastructure.Why It Matters: These cuts target watchdogs that protect disabled Americans from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, threatening a vital safeguard upheld by bipartisan consensus for nearly 50 years.Source: Mother JonesTrump Laid Off Nearly All the Federal Workers Who Investigate Firefighter DeathsWhat Happened: Trump purged nearly all the staff responsible for investigating firefighter fatalities and occupational health risks at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, including 7 of the 8 members of the firefighter fatality investigation team. The purge also halts major studies into firefighter cancer risks and jeopardizes programs supporting 9/11 first responders.Why It Matters: The cuts gut critical safety programs that save firefighters' lives, protect workers, and support emergency responders. Experts warn that the mass layoffs will halt vital investigations, kill lab animals, risk environmental disasters, and obliterate the world\u2019s largest firefighter cancer study.Source: ProPublicaWith CDC injury prevention team gutted, 'we will not know what is killing us'What Happened: RFK Jr. purged the majority of the CDC and Prevention's Injury Center staff, over 200 positions, halting efforts to track and prevent injuries such as car crashes, drownings, suicides, child abuse, and traumatic brain injuries.Why It Matters: With the CDC\u2019s injury prevention teams dismantled, vital projects on concussions, child brain injuries, and suicide forecasting have been wiped out. \u201cWe will not know what is killing us,\u201d one researcher warned. Key data systems are now unmanned, leaving communities flying blind and putting lives across the country at risk.Source: NPRTrump axes key STI lab amid dramatic rise in US syphilis casesWhat Happened: Trump closed the CDC\u2019s top STI lab, eliminating 28 expert staff and halting critical testing for syphilis and drug-resistant gonorrhea. The move comes as states report record spikes in syphilis, including a 1,450% rise in Wisconsin.Why It Matters: The lab was the only U.S. facility with PCR testing for syphilis and was vital to tracking outbreaks. Its closure risks worsening a syphilis crisis and cripples national disease surveillance just as STI rates soar.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchVon der Leyen Warns X, Meta, TikTok to Play by EU RulesWhat Happened: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a blunt warning to Big Tech to follow EU law. Her comments come as Brussels weighs major fines against X, Meta, Apple, and TikTok under the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act.Why It Matters: The warning lands as Trump officials \u2014 especially Vance \u2014 pressure the EU to gut its digital laws, even threatening NATO withdrawal over bogus \u201ccensorship\u201d claims. Von der Leyen didn\u2019t budge, vowing to enforce EU rules \u201cfairly and without bias\u201d and making clear they \u201cdon\u2019t care who\u2019s running\u201d these platforms \u2014 a pointed jab at Elon Musk. The clash deepens tensions and puts more strain on an already fragile transatlantic alliance.Source: PoliticoTrump Shuns Europe, and Europe\u2019s Defense Industry Cashes InWhat Happened: As Trump escalates tariffs and pressures Europe to stop relying on the U.S. for defense, European arms makers are booming. Leonardo, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall are seeing major growth in demand \u2014 both domestically and globally \u2014 with Eurofighter \u201cTyphoon\u201d jets now being bought by Kuwait, and potentially Poland and Turkey.Why It Matters: The shift marks a historic pivot from Europe\u2019s post-Cold War focus on social programs to rearmament, with an $840 billion EU defense package on the table. Investors once wary of defense are now jumping in. The European aerospace and defense index is up 24% this year, while the S&P 500 is down over 10%. Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchKremlin Floats Trump Tower Moscow Revival as Bait for \u2018Big Deal\u2019 With U.S.What Happened: The Kremlin is reportedly considering offering Trump a 150-story Trump Tower in Moscow City to entice him into a sweeping deal to restore U.S.-Russia relations. Russian authorities and major state-backed companies like Rosneft and Rosatom have been brainstorming \u201chooks\u201d to appeal to Trump since his return to power.Why It Matters: This has nothing to do with real estate\u2014it\u2019s a gold-plated ego trap for corrupt, self-serving Trump. The Kremlin is dangling a vanity tower to buy his loyalty and reopen the U.S. to Russia\u2019s strategic goals. It\u2019s geopolitical manipulation masked as luxury branding, and the price will be America\u2019s national security.Source: Moscow Times Russian ServiceSome Jan. 6 Rioters Pardoned by Trump Are Now Embraced as Heroes and Candidates for OfficeWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s blanket pardons for more than 1,500 January 6 rioters and insurrectionists have propelled several into the political spotlight. Former inmates like Ryan Kelley are now speaking at Republican events, hailed as \u201cJ6 patriots,\u201d and some\u2014including Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio\u2014are even eyeing runs for office.Why It Matters: The GOP is normalizing political violence by casting convicted rioters and insurrectionists as heroes and future leaders. It\u2019s a dangerous shift that erodes democratic norms and reiterates their embrace of political violence and authoritarianism.Source: Associated PressRussia Welcomes U.S. Proposal to Deny NATO Membership to UkraineWhat Happened: The Kremlin praised Trump\u2019s proposal to block Ukraine from ever joining NATO\u2014one of Russia\u2019s key demands\u2014but showed no urgency in ending its genocidal war.Why It Matters: Trump is advancing Moscow\u2019s agenda\u2014undermining and betraying Ukraine, fracturing NATO unity, and weakening European security\u2014all while handing Putin strategic wins.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsDow Headed for Worst April Since 1932 as Investors Send \u2018No Confidence\u2019 SignalWhat Happened: The Dow plunged nearly 1,000 points Monday, ending the worst April since 1932. The S&P 500 is posting the weakest performance for any president this early in a term in nearly 100 years\u2014 driven by Trump\u2019s trade war, threats to fire Fed Chair Powell, and mounting fears of economic chaos.Why It Matters: Markets are flashing red over Trump\u2019s erratic economic policies and threats to fire Powell. Investors are dumping stocks, bonds, and even the dollar while volatility spikes. Wall Street has lost confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to manage the economy.Source: Wall Street JournalDropshippers Reel from Trump\u2019s Tariff Gut Punch: \u2018Profit Margins Have Now Been Slashed\u2019What Happened: Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports are wreaking havoc on U.S.-based dropshipping businesses that rely on Chinese suppliers. Products are getting stuck at the border, revenues are dropping, and profit margins are collapsing.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s tariffs, meant to hurt China, are instead crushing American small businesses. Dropshippers report plummeting U.S. sales, rising costs, and are fleeing the market entirely, leaving entrepreneurs scrambling and supply chains in chaos.Source: CNBCTesla Shares Tumble Ahead of Earnings as Musk\u2019s Politics Fuel Investor AnxietyWhat Happened: Tesla stock dropped nearly 6% Monday \u2014 down 44% for the year \u2014 just before its Q1 earnings report.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 21</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Crypto Knocks on the Door of a Banking World That Shut It Out</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> With Trump\\u2019s pro-bitcoin agenda, crypto firms like Circle, BitGo, and Coinbase are seeking bank charters to move deeper into the U.S. financial system. The White House\\u2019s crypto pivot, coupled with legislation to regulate stablecoins, is paving the way for crypto companies to issue currency, take deposits, and offer loans.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Just two years after FTX\\u2019s collapse, Trump is gutting safeguards and pushing a crypto-finance merger with no oversight\\u2014fueling fears of money laundering and conflicts tied to his family\\u2019s digital currency ventures.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-knocks-on-the-door-of-a-banking-world-that-shut-it-out-082b3968?mod=hp_lead_pos10\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Raised $239 Million for Inauguration, More Than Doubling His Own Record</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s second inauguration raked in $239 million\\u2014more than double his 2017 haul\\u2014with donations from over 140 major corporations and wealthy allies, including JPMorgan, Meta, Ripple, and friends of Elon Musk.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The surge in corporate donations shows Trump\\u2019s pay-to-play politics is back in full swing\\u2014and the White House is open for business. It blurs ethical lines and invites influence peddling.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-donors.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trumps Host White House Easter Egg Roll With Corporate Sponsorships</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The White House Easter Egg Roll returned Monday with a corrupt Trump twist: corporate sponsors like Amazon, Meta, and YouTube paid up to $200,000 for branding perks and access, replacing traditional public support.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shatters another norm\\u2014transforming a taxpayer-funded family tradition into a corrupt corporate-sponsored spectacle, blurring the line between governance, profiteering, and propaganda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-host-white-house-easter-egg-roll-corporate-sponorships/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>This Chicken Company Paid Over $100 Million in Fines for Fixing Prices, Then Gave $5 Million to Trump\\u2019s Inauguration</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Pilgrim\\u2019s Pride, the poultry giant that pleaded guilty to price-fixing in 2021, was the top donor to Trump\\u2019s 2025 inauguration, contributing $5 million. The company is controlled by two Brazilian billionaire brothers tied to international bribery. Trump recently paused enforcement of the anti-corruption law they broke.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The donation raises serious concerns about pay-to-play politics and foreign influence. Ethics watchdogs warn it bears the hallmarks of a corrupt quid pro quo\\u2014especially as Trump dismantles anti-bribery laws that once held the company and its billionaire owners accountable.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/donald-trump/inauguration-fundraising-pilgrims-pride\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Calls Powell a \\u2018Major Loser.\\u2019 3 Ways He Could Sideline the Fed Chair</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a \\u201Cmajor loser\\u201D and signaling that the White House is exploring legal avenues to remove or sideline him. Trump wants preemptive rate cuts despite rising inflation fears, and his team is reviewing options to oust Powell.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s push to undermine the Fed\\u2019s independence threatens the core of U.S. monetary policy.

The mandate leaves election officials scrambling to assess whether they need to replace expensive voting machines, many of which are still relatively new.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s barcode voting ban could cost states hundreds of millions and is intended to sow chaos and undermine election integrity in the upcoming 2026 election. It\\u2019s legally dubious, hard to enforce, and risks violating voter privacy\\u2014especially for disabled voters. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.notus.org/2026-election/trump-barcode-election-integrity-states\\\\\\\">NOTUS</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Justice Dept.

The push, backed by Musk, Vance, and Project 2025 leaders, reflects a growing pronatalist movement shaping federal family policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Like Russia, Trump\\u2019s team is pushing policies that reward marriage and childbirth while gutting the programs families actually need. If Republicans cared about birth rates, they would vote for funding child care, family leave, and health care. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Interior Gives Power to DOGE-Linked Official</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Interior Secretary Doug Burgum quietly handed sweeping authority to Tyler Hassen, a Musk-linked operative, allowing him to direct funding, oversee personnel decisions, and reorganize entire bureaus under the guise of \\u201Cefficiency.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This puts a Musk operative in control of massive federal resources, accelerating their takeover of government functions and enabling political purges and restructuring with no oversight.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/newsletters/energy-environment/5259686-interior-gives-power-to-doge-linked-official/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Threatens to Pull Another $1B in Harvard Funding</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As part of his escalating war on universities, Trump is threatening to cut an additional $1 billion in federal health research funding from Harvard. This follows a $2.2 billion freeze after the school refused demands to gut its admissions policies, eliminate DEI programs, and allow federal oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump is weaponizing federal funding to try and force private universities into ideological submission\\u2014gutting academic freedom and bending institutions to his political will. This is textbook authoritarianism to control the curriculum and silence dissent. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5258582-trump-harvard-university-funding-dhs-dei-international-students/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Ups Its Attacks on Maine, Targeting Offshore Wind Projects</h3><p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Trump abruptly issued stop work orders for three federally funded offshore wind research projects at the University of Maine, freezing over $12.6 million in grants. Despite full compliance, the orders came without explanation and coincide with Trump\\u2019s ongoing retaliation against Gov. Janet Mills.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Trump is using federal power to punish Maine for not falling in line with his extremist agenda.

He and his girlfriend were visiting family in Tucson when agents arrested him. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This underscores concerns over the growing wrongful detention of U.S. citizens.
