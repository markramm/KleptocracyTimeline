This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSct6eN0zD4V-eFBAJgR2zCiIIo4ycjZysrCYixcdDpNfm1c1Q/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump appointees have ties to companies that stand to benefit from privatizing weather forecastsWhat Happened: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trump\u2019s NOAA picks have ties to companies that could profit from privatizing federal weather services. Lutnick\u2019s former firm owns a major stake in Satellogic, while Trump\u2019s NOAA nominees have worked for or lobbied on behalf of private weather data firms. Meanwhile, Trump is slashing NOAA budgets and pushing to commercialize forecasting.Why It Matters: Critical weather data could become paywalled, threatening public safety during disasters. Trump\u2019s plan shifts lifesaving services into private hands\u2014with his allies positioned to cash in.Source: Associated PressThe \u2018Trump Pump\u2019: How Crypto Lobbying Won Over a PresidentWhat Happened: A year-long crypto lobbying blitz turned Trump from a Bitcoin skeptic into the industry\u2019s loudest cheerleader. After executives pitched him at Mar-a-Lago and pledged $100 million in donations, Trump echoed their messaging, gutted regulations, and launched his own ventures\u20144 Trump-branded coins and a crypto mining firm.Why It Matters: This is pay-to-play on a massive scale. Crypto insiders drive federal policy, enrich Trump and his circle, and bankroll his campaign\u2014all while reshaping the U.S. financial system for profit. It\u2019s one of the most brazen operations in modern history.Source: New York TimesTrump to attend Club World Cup final, FIFA opens office in Trump TowerWhat Happened: Trump will attend Sunday\u2019s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, as FIFA opens a new office in New York\u2019s Trump Tower\u2014where the trophy is now displayed. FIFA\u2019s president praised Trump\u2019s support ahead of the 2026 World Cup.Why It Matters: The cozy ties between FIFA and Trump spotlight more corruption and conflicts of interest.

Why It Matters: Environmental groups warn the plant threatens fragile coastal ecosystems. Critics say the rushed approval favors Musk\u2019s agenda over community input and environmental protection\u2014another case of public resources being bent to serve private interests.Source: Texas TribuneTrump Sneaked Huge Gift for Peter Thiel\u2013Backed Company Into BudgetWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new budget steers a $6 billion border tech contract to Peter Thiel\u2019s firm, Anduril, by mandating \u201cautonomous capabilities\u201d that Anduril currently offers\u2014shutting out competitors like Elbit and General Dynamics.Why It Matters: Trump is channeling billions in public funds to enrich political allies like Peter Thiel, turning immigration enforcement into a MAGA profit machine. Thiel, in turn, has bankrolled Trump loyalists like JD Vance\u2014tightening the grip of oligarchs over U.S. policy.Source: The New RepublicLobbyists Revel in Trump Bonanza but Ask How Long It Can LastWhat Happened: A $500,000-per-member club launched by Trump insiders highlights the influence-buying frenzy in Washington. Lobbyists tied to Trump are cashing in through secretive deals, foreign clients, and pardon-linked contracts\u2014all while dodging oversight.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s presidency has become a cash machine for allies and insiders. Ethics are collapsing as access is sold to the highest bidder\u2014and with 2027 midterms approaching, they are racing to profit before potential investigations begin.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Treats Tariffs More as a Form of Power Than as a Trade ToolWhat Happened: Trump continues imposing sweeping tariffs\u2014like a sudden 50% copper tariff\u2014without a strategic trade plan. He uses tariffs as tools of dominance, often conflating them with taxes and offering vague, shifting reasons for their implementation.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic tariff decisions destabilize markets, strain alliances, and invite retaliation\u2014with no coherent strategy, just raw displays of control. They double as tools for insider enrichment, giving allies advance knowledge to profit off the chaos.Source: New York TimesMiami city officials cancelled an election. Outraged voters call it a power grabWhat Happened: In a 3\u20132 vote, Miami\u2019s city commission unilaterally delayed local elections until 2026, giving themselves an extra year in office. Officials cited cost savings and higher voter turnout in presidential years, without public input\u2014despite other referendums still scheduled for 2025. Why It Matters: By canceling an election and extending their own terms without voter approval, Miami officials have trampled democratic norms. Legal challenges are underway, but the damage to public trust\u2014and the dangerous precedent\u2014may already be done. Once again, Florida is serving as a laboratory for testing the most outrageous and anti-democratic Republican tactics.Source: The GuardianTrump threatens to slap Brazil with 50 percent tariffs over treatment of Bolsonaro, other disagreementsWhat Happened: Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports unless the country halts its prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, calling the investigation into the far-right ex-president a \u201cWitch Hunt.\u201d He also accused Brazil of censoring American speech. Brazil\u2019s President Lula da Silva responded defiantly, vowing to resist U.S. pressure.Just a reminder: Jair Bolsonaro is being prosecuted for allegedly orchestrating a military-backed coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. The charges include leading a criminal organization, attempting to dismantle democratic institutions, and plotting the assassination or poisoning of President Lula and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Source: Associated PressWhy It Matters: Trump is twisting U.S. trade policy to reward foreign criminals. By putting personal allegiances ahead of national interests, Trump is jeopardizing key strategic alliances. The result is a reckless, petty, and profoundly dangerous approach to foreign policy.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsICE Is Searching a Massive Insurance and Medical Bill Database to Find Deportation TargetsWhat Happened: ICE is using a massive database called ISO ClaimSearch\u2014originally built for insurance fraud detection\u2014to track immigrants for deportation. The system holds over 1.8 billion records, including names, addresses, tax IDs, license plates, and 58 million medical bills. It\u2019s now being secretly repurposed to target undocumented individuals.Why It Matters: By mining private health and insurance data without consent or oversight, the government is turning mass data collection into a weapon of authoritarian control\u2014eroding privacy and civil liberties in the name of \u201cenforcement.\u201dSource: 404 MediaComey Tracked by Secret Service After Post Critical of TrumpWhat Happened: After James Comey posted a beach photo with shells arranged as \u201c86 47,\u201d Secret Service tracked his phone and followed his car across two states. Though he deleted the post and denied violent intent, he was interrogated twice and accused of inciting assassination.Why It Matters: Using federal surveillance to target a Trump critic, and former FBI Director, over a misinterpreted post is an abuse of power, a waste of resources, and shows how dissent is being criminalized and law enforcement is being weaponized to punish enemies.Source: New York TimesDoJ subpoenas clinics and doctors who offer gender-affirming care to minorsWhat Happened: The Justice Department has issued over 20 subpoenas to clinics and doctors providing gender-affirming care to minors, following an April memo likening such care to \u201cfemale genital mutilation\u201d and threatening prosecution. The scope of the subpoenas remains unclear.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated attempt to criminalize gender-affirming care and intimidate medical providers\u2014while testing powers that will be expanded further. Even without charges, the subpoenas create a chilling effect, undermining science-based medicine and endangering the health and safety of trans youth nationwide.Source: The GuardianA surprise IRS move on political endorsements leaves faith leaders and legal experts dividedWhat Happened: The IRS now says pastors can endorse political candidates from the pulpit without risking their church\u2019s tax-exempt status, so long as it\u2019s done in \u201cgood faith\u201d as part of religious messaging. This shift reinterprets the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 rule barring nonprofit political campaigning, though rarely enforced.Why It Matters: Conservatives hail it as a First Amendment win, while legal experts warn it creates a \u201cpolitical tax shelter\u201d for churches. Critics fear blurred church-state lines, campaign finance abuse, and rising political pressure on religious leaders.Source: Associated PressPro-Israel website was used to find names of student protesters to investigate, senior ICE official saysWhat Happened: A senior ICE official testified that \u201cmost\u201d of the names targeted in Trump\u2019s deportation crackdown came from Canary Mission, a pro-Israel site that doxes pro-Palestinian students. DHS\u2019s \u201cTiger Team\u201d reviewed the list of 5,000+ names and redirected counterterror analysts to monitor campus dissent.Why It Matters: Trump officials are using an anonymous political blacklist to surveil and investigate students for their beliefs. This weaponizes federal agencies against free speech and sets the stage for a new era of ideological purges in America.Source: CNNTrump says it will subpoena Harvard for info on foreign studentsWhat Happened: Trump officials plan to issue subpoenas to Harvard for more data on its foreign students, accusing the university of enabling visa abuse and \u201cadvocating violence.\u201d Harvard, already suing over attempts to revoke its student visa certification, now faces renewed threats to its accreditation and federal funding.Why It Matters: This is a full-scale assault on academic independence. Trump is weaponizing immigration and education policy to punish politically unfriendly institutions and intimidate those with global ties\u2014chilling higher education and free inquiry nationwide.Source: CBS NewsHarvard Threatened by US Over Accreditation, Student DataWhat Happened: Trump officials are threatening Harvard\u2019s accreditation and issuing subpoenas over alleged antisemitism and noncompliance with immigration data requests. The Departments of Education, HHS, and DHS accuse the university of \u201cviolating\u201d anti-discrimination laws and obstructing oversight of its foreign student program. Billions in research funds remain frozen amid legal battles.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing accreditation and federal funding to punish elite universities and reshape higher education into a tool of ideological conformity. This is dangerous overreach that threatens academic freedom and due process, with Harvard calling it \u201cunfounded retribution\u201d by the government.Source: BloombergSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump\u2019s social media company strikes deal with friendly news outletWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s media company, Truth Social, is partnering with Newsmax to launch a global streaming service called Truth+. Trump remains the largest shareholder, with his sons managing the company, and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy is a longtime ally.Why It Matters: This blurs the line between journalism and state-aligned propaganda. A sitting president profiting from\u2014and influencing\u2014a media outlet that covers him poses grave ethical and democratic risks. Source: Washington PostExperts Question the Legality of Deploying National Guard Officers as Immigration JudgesWhat Happened: Trump approved Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s plan to use National Guard JAG officers as immigration judges to accelerate deportations. Legal experts say this violates the Posse Comitatus Act and lacks any legal basis unless Trump invokes the Insurrection Act or Congress intervenes.Why It Matters: This is another dangerous authoritarian leap. Using military officers to judge civilian immigration cases would undermine judicial independence, dismantle constitutional safeguards. and set a chilling precedent for military-run courts\u2014hallmarks of martial law.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsGiant bugs, heat and a hospital visit: Inside Alligator Alcatraz\u2019s first daysWhat Happened: Migrants are being detained at Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d  marked by blackout tents, extreme temperatures, constant lighting, broken toilets, and no access to confidential legal counsel. One man was hospitalized\u2014officials denied it. Lawmakers are blocked from visiting, families can\u2019t get answers, and it\u2019s unclear if detainees are in ICE or state custody. DHS says Florida is solely responsible.Why It Matters: This is a human rights crisis unfolding on U.S. soil. Migrants are being disappeared into internment camps with no oversight or legal recourse, and held in harsh conditions. Source: Miami HeraldGreen Card Holder Detained in Alligator Alcatraz Speaks OutWhat Happened: Cuban reggaeton artist and U.S. permanent resident Leamsy Izquierdo said he\u2019s been subjected to freezing temperatures, filthy conditions, and round-the-clock lighting at Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d internment camp. He was transferred there after a July 2 arrest despite posting bail, due to an ICE hold.Why It Matters: The facility, praised by Trump and Kristi Noem, has become a flashpoint for alleged human rights abuses. With reports of human rights violations and oversight gutted, \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d symbolizes the brutality of Trump\u2019s new deportation regime\u2014and serves as a stark warning to green card holders that no one is safe.Source: NewsweekUndocumented builders face unchecked exploitation amid Trump raids: \u2018It\u2019s more work, less pay\u2019What Happened: Undocumented construction workers across the U.S. are facing rising wage theft, abuse, and threats as Trump\u2019s immigration raids intensify. Employers are exploiting fear of deportation to underpay workers and silence complaints, while ICE is reportedly targeting those who speak out or try to organize.Why It Matters: Trump has turned immigration enforcement into a tool to shield abusive employers and crush worker rights. Millions of undocumented laborers keep the housing industry afloat\u2014yet now live in fear, exploited with impunity as the government looks the other way.Source: The GuardianWomen's rights face 'full-on assault' due to UN and aid funding cutsWhat Happened: 4 key UN reports on women\u2019s rights\u2014covering domestic violence, discrimination, and policy improvements\u2014have been delayed or scrapped due to funding cuts. The U.S. has slashed foreign aid and withheld contributions, wiping out $60 million from the UN\u2019s human rights office.Why It Matters: This is a full-scale rollback of global gender equality oversight. At a time when one in four countries is experiencing a backlash against women\u2019s rights, dismantling reporting and accountability systems leaves millions more vulnerable to violence, discrimination, and exploitation\u2014just as vital protections are vanishing.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump\u2019s FEMA Proposals and Feud With Gavin Newsom Could Devastate California\u2019s Disaster ResponseWhat Happened: Trump is slashing FEMA funding as California seeks $40 billion to recover from deadly wildfires. His feud with Gov. Newsom and proposals to raise aid thresholds, cut preparedness grants, and politicize relief threaten the state\u2019s ability to respond.Why It Matters: With disasters worsening, Trump\u2019s FEMA rollback will cripple the  emergency response of California and other states. No state can fill the gap if federal support disappears.Source: ProPublicaAfter Texas floods, questions about FEMA's future loom largeWhat Happened: As floods killed over 120 people in Texas, Trump is accelerating efforts to dismantle FEMA. 16 senior officials have quit, and Trump has floated eliminating the agency entirely.Why It Matters: Gutting FEMA amid record climate disasters leaves millions in danger. With states overwhelmed and relief efforts stalled, the U.S. will face catastrophic failures as weather events intensify.Source: NBC NewsKerrville mayor says he wasn\u2019t aware of state resources that Gov. Abbott said were in place ahead of floodingWhat Happened: Governor Greg Abbott claimed Texas had pre-positioned emergency resources ahead of the July 4 floods that killed over 120 people, including 36 children. But Kerrville\u2019s mayor said he received no such aid and only became aware of the flooding once it was already severe.Why It Matters: The conflicting accounts raise serious concerns about Texas\u2019s emergency preparedness and communication. With over 160 people still missing and public outrage mounting, Governor Abbott and other officials are refusing to provide clear answers.Source: Texas TribuneA decade of missed opportunities: Texas couldn\u2019t find $1M for flood warning system near campsWhat Happened: For over a decade, Texas officials failed to fund a $1 million flood monitoring system in Kerr County, despite repeated warnings and prior deadly floods. Why It Matters: State and local leaders chose budget excuses over basic safety, ignoring the risks. As extreme weather worsens, the disaster highlights the deadly consequences of political inaction and neglected infrastructure.Source: Associated PressUS measles cases at highest level since disease was declared eliminatedWhat Happened: The CDC confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far in 2025\u2014the highest number since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Major outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico are being driven by collapsing childhood vaccination rates and widespread vaccine disinformation.Why It Matters: The U.S. is on the verge of losing its measles elimination status. As herd immunity crumbles, a preventable disease is resurging\u2014fueled by politicized anti-vaccine conspiracies led by RFK Jr.Source: ReutersEPA employees sweat through workplace discomfort that some worry may be more than disrepairWhat Happened: EPA employees have reported weeks of unsafe conditions\u2014broken elevators, extreme heat, and relocation near an active firing range\u2014raising concerns about health and safety. While Trump officials blame deferred maintenance, staff suspect the conditions are meant to drive resignations.Why It Matters: This is deliberate sabotage\u2014an effort to force out experts by degrading their working conditions. It\u2019s part of a broader purge of civil servants that\u2019s crippling the EPA\u2019s ability to protect public health, enforce environmental laws, and respond to growing climate threats.Source: CBS NewsTrump reportedly planning to cut 2,145 Nasa employeesWhat Happened: Trump is planning to purge over 2,100 NASA employees, including 1,818 in core science and human spaceflight roles. This follows a proposed 47% cut to NASA\u2019s science programs in the 2026 budget, drawing public condemnation from seven former NASA science chiefs.Why It Matters: These cuts would cripple U.S. space leadership and cede the future of exploration to China. Trump\u2019s war on science is dismantling innovation, weakening storm forecasting, and gutting missions that inspire and protect.

At the same time, Trump threatened new tariffs and condemned the upcoming BRICS summit in Rio as \u201canti-American.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s defense of an authoritarian criminal undercuts democratic norms and has triggered a diplomatic crisis with Brazil. By mixing loyalty politics with economic threats, Trump is souring key alliances and weaponizing U.S. foreign policy to protect allies.Source: ReutersTo study in the U.S. under Trump, international students scrub their accountsWhat Happened: International students are scrubbing their social media\u2014deleting posts, unfollowing accounts, and using data-wiping tools\u2014to avoid visa denial under Trump\u2019s expanded vetting rules. A leaked State Department cable directs officers to flag \u201chostility\u201d toward U.S. \u201cfounding principles,\u201d sparking global fear over rejected applications based on past online activity.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s undemocratic policy turns free speech into a visa risk, forcing students worldwide to self-censor. It punishes political expression, silences dissent, and undermines America\u2019s standing as a beacon of academic freedom.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia launches huge attack on Ukraine as Kremlin says it's \"quite calm\" about Trump's mounting criticismWhat Happened: Russia launched 728 drones and 13 missiles in a single night, killing 8 civilians in Ukraine\u2019s largest drone strike of the war. The attack came just after Trump criticized Putin and \u201cpledged\u201d more weapons to Ukraine, despite ending shipments the week prior. Targets included airfields near Poland\u2019s border and civilian areas.Why It Matters: As Zelenskyy meets European leaders and the Pope, Russia is escalating its genocidal war\u2014highlighting the urgent need for tougher sanctions and faster military aid to stop this genocidal daily assault.Source: CBS NewsDutch and Norwegian F-35s to patrol Eastern European skies to deter threats from RussiaWhat Happened: Beginning September 1, Dutch F-35s will deploy to Poland to join Norwegian forces in a NATO mission securing airspace and protecting military aid routes to Ukraine. The jets will operate under NATO\u2019s Quick Reaction Alert to intercept Russian incursions and safeguard supply corridors.Why It Matters: With Poland a key logistics hub for Ukraine, NATO is strengthening its eastern defenses. This move sends a clear message: any threat to NATO territory or Ukraine\u2019s aid routes will be met with a swift and coordinated response.Source: The InsiderFar-right conspiracy theories spread online in aftermath of the Texas floodsWhat Happened: After flash floods killed over 120 in Texas, far-right figures like Mike Flynn and Marjorie Taylor Greene pushed conspiracy theories blaming the U.S. government for weather manipulation. Greene even proposed a bill to criminalize \u201cchemical\u201d weather control. Viral posts targeted a cloud-seeding firm and spread false rescue claims, deflecting from FEMA\u2019s failures.Why It Matters: Rather than confront the disaster mismanagement, MAGA influencers are flooding the one with lies\u2014undermining trust, deflecting blame, and fueling extremism when truth and accountability are urgently needed.Source: The GuardianElon Musk Consulted Curtis Yarvin, Right-Wing Thinker, on Third PartyWhat Happened: Elon Musk consulted Curtis Yarvin\u2014a fringe blogger who promotes replacing democracy with a tech-run monarchy\u2014for guidance on launching his \u201cAmerica Party,\u201d despite having no campaign experience. Yarvin is known for extremist conspiracies and openly anti-democratic views.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s continued embrace of authoritarian ideologues exposes the dark undercurrents of his third-party plans.

The court ruled prosecutors failed to prove he conspired with others to suppress votes, despite claims that 5,000 people interacted with the fake posts.Why It Matters: The ruling weakens federal efforts to hold election disinformation operatives accountable. Even with intent to deceive, the court said posting false election info alone doesn\u2019t meet the legal bar for conspiracy.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump\u2019s trade blitz produces few deals but lots of uncertaintyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d pledge has unraveled, with only the UK and Vietnam signing trade pacts. Most nations rejected his tariff-heavy approach, while businesses face shifting rules and delays. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic trade policy continues to destabilize the global economy without producing real results. Investment is stalling, the dollar is weakening, norms are collapsing, and fears of a global slowdown are mounting as tariffs become a tool to bankroll his tax cuts.Source: Associated PressHow Trump's trade war is upending the global economyWhat Happened: Since returning to office, Trump has launched sweeping tariffs\u2014up to 145% on Chinese goods and 50% on metals\u2014sparking market chaos, legal fights, and strained alliances. Key industries like semiconductors, autos, and pharma are now in the crosshairs.Why It Matters: This is economic warfare.

She also pledged to block\u2014and potentially seize\u2014farmland owned by \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d like China.Why It Matters: Mass deportations are wreaking havoc on the U.S. food supply chain. Replacing essential labor with automation or Medicaid recipients is unrealistic.Source: ReutersTrump says U.S. interest rate is at least 3 points too highWhat Happened: Trump demanded the Federal Reserve slash interest rates by at least 3 percentage points, arguing current rates cost the U.S. $360 billion per point in debt servicing. He dismissed inflation concerns and claimed lower rates would boost business investment.Why It Matters: Trump continues pressuring the Fed to serve his political and economic agenda. Such a drastic cut could fuel asset bubbles, further weaken the dollar, and undermine the Fed\u2019s independence\u2014threatening long-term U.S. economic stability and credibility.Source: ReutersThe GOP blew past debt warnings. The markets have noticed.What Happened: Congressional Republicans passed Trump\u2019s spending and tax cut bill, slashing taxes while abandoning spending cuts\u2014despite warnings from Wall Street. Treasury yields spiked, and economists fear it will worsen the $36 trillion debt. GOP leaders ignored pleas from figures like Ray Dalio and Jamie Dimon to rein in deficits.Why It Matters: The bill confirms that fiscal discipline is dead.
