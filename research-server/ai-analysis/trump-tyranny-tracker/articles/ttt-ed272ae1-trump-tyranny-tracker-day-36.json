Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 24Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsDraft US-Ukraine rare earth minerals deal not one President Zelensky would acceptWhat Happened: A leaked draft deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals is nothing more than blunt extortion. The proposal demands that Ukraine hand over its critical resources without any American obligations, essentially taking advantage of a war-torn nation under a genocidal attack.Why It Matters: This deal is a blatant attempt to extort value from Ukraine by exploiting its vulnerable state. It undermines Ukraine's sovereignty and security, setting a dangerous precedent where the US leverages desperate circumstances for its gain\u2014at the expense of Ukraine.Source: CNNRobinhood Says SEC Closes Crypto InvestigationWhat Happened: Robinhood announced that the SEC has closed its investigation into its crypto division over alleged failures to register certain crypto assets as securities, with no enforcement action forthcoming. Why It Matters: This move is part of a broader pattern under Trump, where regulatory decisions are tilted in favor of industry insiders. Such corrupt favoritism undermines investor protections and sets a dangerous precedent for fair market oversight.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Appoints Right-Wing Podcaster Dan Bongino as FBI Deputy DirectorWhat Happened: Trump has installed conspiracy, far-right extremist podcaster Dan Bongino as the FBI's deputy director. Despite having no FBI background, Bongino\u2014known for his hostile rants against the media and previous FBI leaders\u2014is now tasked with reforming the agency. Why It Matters: This blatantly politicizes the FBI by putting a partisan extremist in a top leadership position. Trump is stripping the agency's impartiality and credibility, turning law enforcement into a tool for enforcing Trump's political agenda rather than upholding the Constitution.Source: Associated PressVA dismisses more than 1,400 probationary employeesWhat Happened: The Department of Veterans Affairs announced the dismissal of over 1,400 probationary employees, following a previous round of more than 1,000 terminations on February 13.Why It Matters: The dismantles critical VA services, gutting support staff under the guise of efficiency.

Lawmakers called for Martin\u2019s resignation for betraying his duty.Source: GuardianPro-Trump Prosecutor Shields MAGA Rep from ArrestWhat Happened: The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, led by Trump loyalist Ed Martin, blocked an arrest warrant for Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL) after D.C. police sought his arrest for allegedly assaulting a woman. The case was quietly reclassified as a \"family disturbance,\" and MPD's Internal Affairs is now investigating the cover-up.Why It Matters: This is pure political protection. Martin, who calls himself \u201cTrump\u2019s lawyer,\u201d has also threatened Musk critics and defended Jan. 6th insurrectionists and rioters.

This move is part of a plan to shutter 53 emergency shelters by June and recover $80 million in FEMA funds.Why It Matters: This is the quid pro quo everyone warned about\u2014if Adams follows Trump\u2019s orders, the DOJ drops federal charges. It\u2019s a blatant signal that loyalty to Trump buys legal protection.Source: NBC NewsTrump Ally Moves to Impeach JudgeWhat Happened: Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) filed an impeachment resolution against U.S. District Judge John Bates after the judge ordered health agencies to restore datasets scrubbed under Trump\u2019s anti-\u201cgender ideology\u201d directive. Ogles accused Bates of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201dWhy It Matters: The move targets judicial independence and aligns with Ogles\u2019 broader push to consolidate Trump\u2019s power. He also introduced a House Joint Resolution to amend the Constitution, allowing Trump to seek a third term.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsIdaho woman forcibly dragged from local Republican town hall by private securityWhat Happened: Teresa Borrenpohl was forcibly removed from a Kootenai County Republican town hall.

Carr\u2019s actions aren\u2019t routine checks; they\u2019re a deliberate crackdown aimed at punishing any media critical of Trump, using flimsy complaints as a pretext.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t oversight\u2014it\u2019s a blatant attack on free speech. By weaponizing the FCC, Trump is chilling independent journalism and undermining First Amendment rights, threatening the very foundation of our democracy.Source: GuardianTrump Orders $200M DHS Ad Campaign Praising Himself, Threatening MigrantsWhat Happened: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed that Trump personally ordered a $200 million DHS ad campaign to thank him for \"closing the border\" and to warn undocumented immigrants to leave or be hunted down. The ads, featuring Noem, are airing across the U.S., Latin America, and the Middle East.Why It Matters: This taxpayer-funded propaganda campaign promotes Trump while spreading fear among migrant communities. It\u2019s an authoritarian misuse of government resources for political self-promotion and intimidation.Source: Rolling StoneTrump Lies\u2014 6% Federal Worker StatWhat Happened: Despite clear evidence, officials have been pushing lies that only 6% of federal workers work full-time in offices\u2014a figure from a dubious survey used to paint federal employees as lazy.Why It Matters: This false stat is a deliberate tactic to justify government purges, attack federal workers, and erode trust in public institutions\u2014hallmark behavior of authoritarian regimes.Source: ProPublica\u2018Not what we signed up for\u2019: inside Trump\u2019s \u2018shocking\u2019 Kennedy Center takeoverWhat Happened: Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center, ousting chair David Rubenstein and President Deborah Rutter. Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s appointee, now leads a partisan shift toward an \u201canti-woke\u201d agenda, sparking a mass exodus of artists, donors, and cultural leaders.Why It Matters: This takeover isn\u2019t just bureaucratic reshuffling\u2014it\u2019s a full-blown coup on a cherished cultural institution. By turning the Kennedy Center into a political pawn, Trump is undermining the very essence of American arts and free expression.Source: Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsArizona latest state to consider bounties to aid Trump deportationsWhat Happened: Arizona lawmakers are about to vote on a bill that would pay police $2,500 for every illegal immigrant they help deport\u2014financed by taxing international money transfers.Why It Matters: This bounty scheme, pushed by Trump allies, incentivizes racial profiling and aggressive immigration enforcement and will undermine law enforcement.Source: ReutersIowa Republicans back a bill that would strip gender identity from the state\u2019s civil rights codeWhat Happened: Republican lawmakers in Iowa advanced a bill at the state Capitol that would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights code.

The guidance, citing the 2023 Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard ruling, gave institutions 14 days to comply.Why It Matters: The DCL expands the definition of illegal racial discrimination beyond what Title VI or recent court rulings require, effectively outlawing DEI efforts. Legal experts argue Trump lacks the legal authority to redefine federal law, making enforcement unlikely due to due process protections and OCR\u2019s limited capacity.Source: Brookings InstituteTrump Fires Alabama's Only School Civil Rights InvestigatorWhat Happened: Trump fired Victoria DeLano, Alabama's sole federal civil rights investigator for schools, as part of widespread cuts under FAKE unauthorized DOGE. DeLano handled cases involving discrimination and unfair treatment of students with disabilities.Why It Matters: Her firing leaves Alabama families with little recourse for addressing civil rights violations in schools. With no local or state accountability and limited federal oversight, parents fear their children will face discrimination without intervention.Source: AL.com\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump aid freeze disrupts anti-narcotics program at Mexican portsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze halted funding for a UN-backed program that provided training and equipment to improve cargo screening at key Mexican ports, disrupting efforts to block drug cartels from smuggling fentanyl chemicals.Why It Matters: With funding on hold, Mexico's ports become more vulnerable to narcotics trafficking, weakening US counternarcotics operations and border security.

York\u2014using a \"Secretary of the Treasury\" address\u2014ordering them to detail their weekly work in response to Elon Musk\u2019s mandate.

Elon Musk\u2019s operatives are using this data to slash the federal workforce, with non-compliance treated as resignation. Why It Matters: Musk, an unelected billionaire, plans to use AI to purge federal workers, gutting protections and crippling agencies through secretive, algorithmic firings. This is insane.Source: NBC NewsHHS warns employees that responses to Elon Musk's request may 'be read by malign foreign actors'What Happened: HHS sent an email warning its employees that any responses to OPM\u2019s directive might be intercepted by hostile foreign actors. The email clarified that replying is voluntary and advised staff to keep their responses general to protect sensitive data.Why It Matters: This highlights serious concerns about cybersecurity and the potential exposure of critical information amid controversial federal directives, emphasizing the risk of foreign interference in government communications.Source: NBC NewsMedical research labs brace for possible funding cuts that could disrupt their workWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s plan to cap NIH indirect costs at 15%\u2014down from 56%\u2014threatens vital biomedical research, forcing layoffs and halting critical projects.Why It Matters: Slashing indirect costs guts the backbone of U.S. biomedical research, delaying critical studies on diseases like COVID-19 and the flu. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the cap, but the future of research funding remains in jeopardy.Source: NPRMass firing hits national parks ahead of busy summer seasonWhat Happened: Trump and Musk fired 1,000 National Park Service employees, leaving parks, already running 20% below staffing levels, dangerously understaffed. The cuts will cause shorter operating hours, longer lines, and canceled guided tours at key sites like Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion.Why It Matters: These mass firings threaten the upkeep and safety of our national parks. Losing experienced, full-time staff will lead to a deteriorating state of public lands just as summer crowds hit.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchU.S. votes against U.N. resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine warWhat Happened: The UN General Assembly approved a resolution, drafted by Ukraine and the EU, condemning Russia for its full-scale invasion. Backed by 93 countries, the measure was opposed by the US, Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Israel, Hungary, etc. The resolution labels Russia as an aggressor and demands troop withdrawal.Why It Matters: The U.S. siding with Russia and North Korea against its European allies exposes a stark, dangerous shift in U.S. policy under Trump, fracturing longstanding alliances and emboldening authoritarian regimes. Source: Washington Post\u2018Dark MAGA\u2019 spreads as conservatives embrace Musk\u2019s influence on TrumpWhat Happened: At CPAC, conservatives ditched subtlety, mixing red MAGA with black \u201cDark MAGA\u201d hats\u2014a clear nod to Elon Musk\u2019s rising clout in conservative politics. Musk flaunted his chainsaw and radical anti-government stance.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s takeover is a raw display of billionaire self-interest merging with Trump\u2019s reckless policies.
