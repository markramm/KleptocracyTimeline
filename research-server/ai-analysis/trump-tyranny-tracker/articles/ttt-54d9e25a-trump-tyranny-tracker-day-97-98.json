(Lee Matz/Milwaukee Independent via AP)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 26-27 Weekend RecapWelcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump-Aligned Club for the Ultra Rich Launches in WashingtonWhat Happened: Donald Trump Jr., Omeed Malik, and other Trump allies are launching \u201cExecutive Branch,\u201d a $500K invite-only private club in Georgetown for tech moguls and Trump insiders. Founding members include David Sacks, the Winklevoss twins, and Chamath Palihapitiya.Why It Matters: Trump allies are building elite spaces to trade access and power behind closed doors. It\u2019s not just a club\u2014it\u2019s a symbol of oligarchic consolidation and corruption in Trump\u2019s second term. Meanwhile, founding member David Sacks serves as Trump\u2019s crypto czar, further blurring the lines between state power and private wealth.Source: PoliticoGOP Medicaid Debate Intensifies as Republicans Search for CutsWhat Happened: House Republicans are considering up to $880 billion in Medicaid cuts to fund Trump\u2019s tax agenda. While conservatives push for deep rollbacks, moderates oppose slashing coverage for vulnerable Americans. Why It Matters: Medicaid covers 70+ million Americans, and steep cuts would devastate access to care nationwide\u2014 to fund tax breaks for the wealthy.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump White House Moves to Defund Independent Social Security BoardWhat Happened: Trump is quietly eliminating funding for the Social Security Advisory Board, a bipartisan agency that provides independent oversight and analysis on strengthening and sustaining Social Security. The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget has proposed slashing the board\u2019s entire $3 million annual budget to zero.Why It Matters: This is another step in Trump\u2019s broader effort to dismantle oversight and silence independent voices within the federal government. While the Social Security Advisory Board doesn\u2019t have formal power, it has long shaped critical policy debates that protect benefits for 73 million Americans. Trump is paving the way to shrink or privatize Social Security.Source: ReutersNew Details Emerge on Trump Officials\u2019 Sprint to Gut Consumer Bureau StaffWhat Happened: Within hours of a court ruling allowing limited staff cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Trump officials, coordinating with Musk, fired nearly 1,500 employees, slashing 90% of the agency. Internal records reveal the purge was rushed, chaotic, and likely unlawful. Why It Matters: Despite a judge\u2019s limits, Trump and Musk\u2019s operatives rushed to gut the CFPB\u2014firing 90% of staff in a chaotic, likely illegal process. The purge threatens core consumer protections and reveals a reckless drive to dismantle oversight.Source: New York TimesTrump Tightens Control of Federal Workforce as Musk \u201cPulls Back\u201d From DOGEWhat Happened: Trump has centralized control of federal hiring and firing within the Office of Personnel Management, stripping agencies of autonomy. Senior staff will now be judged on loyalty to Trump\u2019s agenda. Though Musk claims to be \u201cretreating,\u201d his purge tactics are becoming permanent policy.Why It Matters: This overhaul politicizes the civil service, replacing a merit-based system with one driven by loyalty to Trump. By empowering OPM to fire workers based on ideological \u201csuitability,\u201d the regime can purge dissent and embed loyalists\u2014mirroring authoritarian regimes.

The letters questioned editorial bias and suggested \u201cundue influence\u201d from funders \u2014 without evidence.Why It Matters: This is part of a broader push to intimidate scientific institutions, chill dissent, and pressure journals to align with Trump\u2019s extremist agenda\u2014echoing threats by RFK Jr. to prosecute medical publications.Source: New York TimesFBI Director Posts Photo of Arrested Wisconsin Judge\u2019s Perp Walk, Possibly Violating DOJ PolicyWhat Happened: Kash Patel posted a photo on X of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan being perp-walked in handcuffs, captioned \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Legal experts say the post likely violates Justice Department policy barring the release of defendant photos unless for a law enforcement purpose. Why It Matters: Publicly shaming and arresting a sitting judge marks a dangerous escalation by Trump as he weaponizes the FBI to target perceived enemies and turns law enforcement into propaganda theater. These public intimidation tactics mirror those used in Russia and are part of a broader assault on the judiciary, the last institutional check on Trump\u2019s power.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump v 60 Minutes Is a Stunning Battle for the Soul of U.S. MediaWhat Happened: Trump is suing 60 Minutes and CBS for $10B over a Kamala Harris interview.

Trump\u2019s FCC chair, Brendan Carr, holds the power over the merger\u2019s approval.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t just a lawsuit but a warning to the free press. Trump continues to use legal threats, regulatory pressure, and financial leverage to control newsrooms. Resignations and corporate cave-ins highlight the threat to editorial independence under an authoritarian regime.Source: The Guardian\u201860 Minutes\u2019 Chastises Its Corporate Parent in Unusual On-Air RebukeWhat Happened: In a rare public rebuke, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley used Sunday\u2019s broadcast to call out corporate parent Paramount for interfering in the show\u2019s editorial independence. The on-air protest followed the abrupt resignation of longtime executive producer Bill Owens, who said he could no longer run the program freely.Why It Matters: The free press is under attack.

The 4-year-old, who has Stage 4 cancer, was taken without his medication. Lawyers were preparing a habeas petition, but ICE removed the children before it could be filed.Why It Matters: This marks a grave violation of constitutional rights, as U.S. citizens\u2014especially vulnerable children\u2014are being deported without due process.

The gaslighting is staggering.Why It Matters: This is state-sponsored cruelty.

Nonprofits are now laying off staff and shutting down vital services, including hotlines and legal aid, after being told their programs no longer \u201ceffectuate\u201d DOJ priorities.Why It Matters: This is a sweeping gutting of violence prevention and victim support services, slashing aid to the most vulnerable\u2014including children, the disabled, and marginalized communities.

While some Ukrainians acknowledge the land may be temporarily lost, lawmakers insist any formal surrender is off the table and could constitute treason under Ukrainian law.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t just betray Ukraine\u2014it pressures Kyiv to legitimize Russia\u2019s illegal 2014 invasion and occupation.

Founding members include David Sacks, the Winklevoss twins, and Chamath Palihapitiya.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump allies are building elite spaces to trade access and power behind closed doors. It\\u2019s not just a club\\u2014it\\u2019s a symbol of oligarchic consolidation and corruption in Trump\\u2019s second term.

The White House\\u2019s Office of Management and Budget has proposed slashing the board\\u2019s entire $3 million annual budget to zero.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another step in Trump\\u2019s broader effort to dismantle oversight and silence independent voices within the federal government. While the Social Security Advisory Board doesn\\u2019t have formal power, it has long shaped critical policy debates that protect benefits for 73 million Americans.

Senior staff will now be judged on loyalty to Trump\\u2019s agenda. Though Musk claims to be \\u201Cretreating,\\u201D his purge tactics are becoming permanent policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This overhaul politicizes the civil service, replacing a merit-based system with one driven by loyalty to Trump.
