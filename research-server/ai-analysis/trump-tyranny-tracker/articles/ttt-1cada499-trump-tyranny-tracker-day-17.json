The initiative \u2018aims\u2019 to boost economic growth and strategic reserves, with incoming Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick seen as a proponent.Why It Matters: This would be the first U.S. government-backed Bitcoin reserve. Critics warn of volatility risks and favoritism toward Trump\u2019s crypto allies and family.Source: Bitcoin\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMusk\u2019s DOGE Targets Medicare, Medicaid OfficesWhat Happened: Elon Musk and his operatives gained access to key payment and contract systems at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees $1.5 trillion in federal health spending. While CMS confirmed ongoing collaboration, it has not clarified whether sensitive medical data is at risk. Why It Matters: CMS manages Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, covering 150 million Americans. Fake DOGE\u2019s control over CMS raises privacy concerns, potential healthcare budget cuts, and partisan fears over misuse of data. With Musk and Trump prioritizing cost-cutting, they may also cut benefits under the guise of eliminating fraud.Source: The HillDOGE Moves to Shield Records from FOIA ScrutinyWhat Happened: Elon Musk and his operatives have ordered employees to stop using Slack as it transitions to a new records system that is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. By reclassifying itself under the Executive Office of the President rather than the Office of Management and Budget, fake DOGE aims to limit public and congressional access to its communications. Why It Matters:  This move is a blatant effort to obscure communications and evade public scrutiny of potentially illegal actions. As DOGE seizes control of federal agencies, budget systems, private citizen data, and national security infrastructure, it is operating as an unaccountable governing body without legitimate authorization. Source: 404 MediaDOGE Expands to More Federal Agencies, Gains Access to Health Payment SystemsWhat Happened: Elon Musk and his operatives have expanded their reach across federal agencies, gaining access to sensitive health payment systems at HHS, CMS, and CDC while also targeting Labor Department records.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked access to critical health payment systems raises privacy concerns as it handles trillions in Medicare/Medicaid transactions. What exactly are they planning to do with this stolen data?Source: Washington PostMusk\u2019s DOGE Engineer Gains NOAA Access, Raising Security FearsWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s operatives placed Nikhil Rajpal, an ex-Twitter and Tesla engineer, inside NOAA. Ordered by acting Commerce Secretary Jeremy Pelter, NOAA staff were told to grant Rajpal full access to internal systems.Why It Matters: NOAA is critical for climate research and disaster forecasting. Giving an unqualified, unvetted Musk operative control risks data manipulation, aligning with Project 2025\u2019s push to privatize weather services and weaken climate science.Source: WIREDElon Musk Aide Is Now Working at VA and Accessing Its Computer SystemsWhat Happened: Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has raised red flags that Elon Musk and his operatives may have gained unauthorized access to veterans\u2019 private health records at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Murray warned that DOGE\u2019s reckless intrusion into federal agencies could endanger the health and privacy of millions of veterans, especially as Musk\u2019s team has already accessed sensitive financial and personnel data at the Treasury Department and Office of Personnel Management.Why It Matters: With access to veterans' medical and financial records, DOGE can compromise VA healthcare policies, target specific groups of veterans, or misuse sensitive medical data. Lawsuits are already mounting against Musk\u2019s illegal data mining operations, with federal unions suing the Treasury for giving Musk\u2019s operatives full access to the government's payment systems. This power grab is an unprecedented breach of federal oversight and should raise alarms about national security, privacy, and political abuse.Source: Military .comTrump Regime Moves to Politicize Federal CIO PositionsWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management issued a memo recommending that Chief Information Officers be reclassified from \u201ccareer reserved\u201d to \u201cgeneral employees,\u201d making them political appointees rather than impartial career officials. This move would allow the regime to install political loyalists, including Musk-aligned tech figures, into critical IT roles. Agencies have until February 14 to comply with the reclassification.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to purge civil servants and consolidate power through his Schedule F initiative. Politicizing federal CIOs\u2014who oversee cybersecurity, AI, and data security\u2014will put critical government infrastructure at risk. The move would allow Musk and his operatives to take control of federal IT policies, including AI deployment and data management. This will compromise government cybersecurity, centralize tech decisions under political influence, and enable misuse of federal data.Source: FedScoopTrump Expands Intelligence Buyouts, Raising Fears of Politicized Spy AgenciesWhat Happened: Trump has extended buyout offers to employees across multiple U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, NSA, ODNI, NGA, and NRO, as part of Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s drive to seize federal agencies. Former intelligence officials and lawmakers fear mass purges will lead to the replacement of experienced analysts with Trump loyalists who shape intelligence to fit his policies and carry out illegal acts.Why It Matters: Cutting veteran intelligence officers threatens national security, weakens intelligence-gathering capabilities, and risks turning agencies into politicized tools. Trump has long clashed with the intelligence community over findings that Russia interfered in multiple U.S. elections to help him. The buyouts will erode independent intelligence assessments, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to foreign threats.Source: ReutersEmil Bove: The Lawyer Behind Trump\u2019s DOJ OverhaulWhat Happened: Emil Bove, Trump\u2019s former criminal defense lawyer, is now acting deputy attorney general, leading sweeping changes at the Justice Department. Bove has fired Jan. 6th prosecutors, ordered investigations into local officials who refuse to assist federal immigration authorities, and is overseeing a crackdown on \u201cdeep state\u201d prosecutors. He is expected to become Deputy AG once Todd Blanche\u2014another Trump defense attorney\u2014is confirmed as Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s top deputy.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s rapid restructuring of the DOJ aligns with Trump\u2019s revenge-driven agenda, particularly targeting those involved in the Jan. 6 prosecutions. Trump and his loyalists are politicizing law enforcement to protect Trump and target his opponents.Source: ReutersU.S. AI Safety Institute Director Resigns Amid Trump\u2019s AI OverhaulWhat Happened: Elizabeth Kelly, director of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), has resigned, leaving the future of the agency uncertain under the Trump regime. Kelly, appointed under Biden, led initiatives to test AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic and collaborated with global AI safety bodies. Trump has already revoked Biden\u2019s 2023 AI executive order.Why It Matters: Kelly\u2019s departure signals a potential shift in AI governance, most likely weakening federal oversight of AI risks. With Trump\u2019s regime prioritizing deregulation, AI development will proceed without the necessary safeguards. The AI industry, already facing ethical and security challenges, could now see looser government controls, increasing the risk of unchecked and dangerous AI proliferation.Source: ReutersMusk\u2019s DOGE to Overhaul Air Traffic Control SystemWhat Happened: Elon Musk announced that he will implement rapid safety upgrades to the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control system. The move follows a recent FAA system outage and a deadly midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed fake DOGE\u2019s involvement in overseeing the system.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s direct control over FAA safety infrastructure raises concerns about privatization, oversight, and cybersecurity risks. With unauthorized DOGE expanding across federal agencies, Musk continues to increase his influence over critical national infrastructure.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsPam Bondi\u2019s First Moves as Attorney General Reshape DOJWhat Happened: Newly sworn-in Attorney General Pam Bondi issued 14 directives immediately after taking office, focusing on reversing Trump-era investigations, reshaping immigration enforcement, dismantling DEI programs, and reinstating the federal death penalty. Bondi is closing the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force, investigating prosecutors who pursued Trump, and pausing grants to sanctuary cities and organizations assisting undocumented immigrants.Why It Matters: Bondi\u2019s DOJ is aggressively targeting Trump\u2019s past legal adversaries, expanding immigration crackdowns, and eliminating civil rights programs. The closure of the Foreign Influence Task Force weakens oversight of foreign meddling, and reinstating the death penalty signals a harsher criminal justice stance and intentionally tweaking national security. Source: POLITICOWhite House Orders CIA to Release Employee List, Raising Security FearsWhat Happened: The White House ordered the CIA to send an unclassified email listing names and initials of employees hired in the past two years as part of Trump's federal workforce reduction. The list included new analysts and operatives focused on China, raising counterintelligence concerns about potential leaks to adversaries like China and Russia.\u201cThe list included first names and the first initial of the last name of the new hires, who are still on probation \u2014 and thus easy to dismiss. It included a large crop of young analysts and operatives who were hired specifically to focus on China, and whose identities are usually closely guarded because Chinese hackers are constantly seeking to identify them.\u201dWhy It Matters: Former officials warn this move is a \u201ccounterintelligence disaster,\u201d as foreign intelligence agencies could exploit the data. The CIA\u2019s China-focused recruits\u2014a growing priority\u2014could be disproportionately affected. Source: The New York TimesTrump regime evicts former Coast Guard leader from her house with 3 hours noticeWhat Happened: Former Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, the first woman to lead a U.S. military branch, was forcibly evicted from her military housing on Tuesday with just three hours notice. Fagan, who was fired by Trump on his second day in office for her \u201cexcessive focus\u201d on DEI and border security policies, was given a 60-day waiver to find new housing\u2014until DHS abruptly revoked it at Trump's request. DHS officials even demanded interior photos of her residence, a move insiders called \u201ca strange power play.\u201dWhy It Matters: This high-profile, punitive eviction sends a chilling message to career military leaders who don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s agenda, demonstrating his willingness to humiliate and retaliate against even four-star admirals. A classic authoritarian tactic.Source: NBC NewsRepublicans Block Subpoena for Musk as DOGE Seizes Government DataWhat Happened: Congressional Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to subpoena Elon Musk to testify about his fake DOGE and its unauthorized access to federal data and spending freezes. Despite protests demanding accountability, Musk has remained out of public view since Trump\u2019s inauguration and continues to slash agency budgets, freeze funding, and access sensitive government systems.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked authority over federal operations raises major concerns about government transparency, financial manipulation, and national security. As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk is not an official U.S. officer but is gutting agencies and purging federal workers without congressional oversight. With Republicans shielding him from testimony, Democrats warn this sets a dangerous precedent for unelected billionaires seizing control of the government.Source: ABC NewsTrump DOJ Targets FBI, Jan. 6 InvestigatorsWhat Happened: AG Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Emil Bove moved to purge FBI officials who investigated Jan. 6 rioters, accusing acting FBI leaders of \u2018insubordination\u2019 for resisting. Bondi also launched a working group to investigate officials who pursued Trump-related prosecutions, including the Manhattan DA and the NY Attorney General.Why It Matters: Trump is turning the DOJ into his personal enforcer, intimidating FBI agents, dismantling independent law enforcement, and shielding himself from accountability. He is using the DOJ to go after officials involved in cases against him and his cronies but will shift to going after the opposition. This mirrors the tactics of Russia\u2019s law enforcement and the Prosecutor General\u2019s office.Source: The New York TimesFCC Publishes CBS\u2019 Kamala Harris Interview, Dismissing Trump\u2019s \u2018Election Interference\u2019 ClaimsWhat Happened: The FCC released the full transcript of Kamala Harris\u2019 contested \u201860 Minutes\u2019 interview, disproving Trump\u2019s claims that CBS doctored the footage to favor Democrats. The unedited transcript confirms standard editing practices, not manipulation. Despite this, FCC Chair Brendan Carr\u2014a Trump ally\u2014extended the case for public comment through March, keeping pressure on CBS.Why It Matters: The FCC\u2019s revival of Trump\u2019s complaint highlights that the agency is being weaponized to attack media outlets critical of Trump. With probes into NPR, PBS, and other networks underway, the FCC is undermining press freedom to silence opposition. Meanwhile, Paramount Global, CBS\u2019 parent company, is reportedly considering settling Trump\u2019s lawsuit to secure government approval for its merger, illustrating the chilling effect of Trump\u2019s influence.Source: CNNDOJ Drops Case Against Project Veritas Over Ashley Biden\u2019s DiaryWhat Happened: The Justice Department declined to charge Project Veritas over its role in acquiring and attempting to publish Ashley Biden\u2019s stolen diary before the 2020 election. Despite years of investigation and FBI searches, the DOJ did not explain its decision.Why It Matters: This move highlights the DOJ backing off cases involving Trump allies, as Project Veritas has long supported him. At the same time, Trump\u2019s DOJ is aggressively targeting his political opponents, using the justice system to shield his allies while punishing those who investigated or prosecuted him, further cementing the department\u2019s role as a tool for his authoritarian agenda.Source: The New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Revokes Security Detail for Former Defense OfficialsWhat Happened: The Defense Department revoked former Defense Secretary Mark Esper\u2019s security detail Tuesday night, following similar removals for Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Brian Hook. Esper, who has received credible threats from Iran over the 2020 assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, is the latest official from Trump\u2019s first term to lose government protection. Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley also had his security detail revoked last week, along with his security clearance, and the Pentagon removed his portrait from its walls.Why It Matters: Stripping security from high-risk former officials\u2014particularly those targeted by foreign adversaries\u2014raises concerns about retaliation threats, national security risks, and Trump\u2019s use of power to punish former critics. Source: CBS NewsRight-Wing Group Targets Federal Workers in \u2018D.E.I. Watch List\u2019What Happened: The American Accountability Foundation published a watch list of over 50 federal employees involved in DEI initiatives, calling for Trump to fire them. The list includes names, photos, and accusations based on political donations, social media activity, and past work on health equity. Many targeted workers are black employees in health agencies like the CDC and NIH.Why It Matters: This escalates the far-right's war on career civil servants beyond just eliminating DEI offices. The list exposes federal employees to harassment and threats. With Trump sycophants leading this dangerous push, we need to watch if these tactics spread to other agencies, states, and private companies.Source: The New York TimesTrump Picks Joe Kent to Lead U.S. Counterterrorism CenterWhat Happened: Trump appointed Joe Kent as director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Kent, a former Green Beret and CIA officer, has defended Jan. 6 insurrectionists as \"political prisoners\" and has ties to a former Proud Boys member.Why It Matters: Trump continues to reshape intelligence leadership with loyalists who have attacked federal agencies. This is a classic authoritarian move to install allies in key positions who will prioritize loyalty over the law, ensuring they carry out his orders\u2014even if they are illegal or compromise national security. This politicization of intelligence threatens the integrity of U.S. security operations and enables unchecked executive power.Source: NBC NewsDemocrats sue GOP county executive over armed volunteer unit they say amounts to an illegal militiaWhat Happened: Democrats in Nassau County, NY, sued Republican County Executive Bruce Blakeman over his creation of an armed volunteer unit\u2014shrouded in secrecy\u2014calling it an illegal militia. They argue that state law only allows trained law enforcement officers to be deputized, not private citizens. The lawsuit challenges the lack of transparency, as Blakeman\u2019s office has refused to disclose who is being recruited, their training, weapons, or taxpayer costs. Why It Matters: This case raises major concerns about untrained civilians wielding police power, especially in a county with one of the largest police forces in the U.S., and Trump allies seeking to form private militia groups. Deputizing armed volunteers blurs the line between law enforcement and political militias, a growing trend under GOP leadership.We need to watch for similar efforts in other counties and states, as Republican officials push expanded use of militia groups amid federal rollbacks on civil rights protections. Source: AP\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Considers Labeling Migrants a Measles, Tuberculosis RiskWhat Happened: Trump is exploring ways to invoke Title 42\u2014the emergency health law used during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014to ban asylum seekers at the southern border under the pretext of measles and tuberculosis outbreaks. Trump officials are deploying health officers to the border and examining disease cases to justify reintroducing the controversial policy. Why It Matters: This move weaponizes public health laws to justify circumventing asylum protections, a tactic courts previously ruled against. Public health experts warn that existing medical measures\u2014such as vaccinations and screenings\u2014are sufficient, making this a politically motivated immigration crackdown rather than a genuine health response. Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump plans to use notorious Guant\u00e1namo detention facility and nearby tents to hold immigrantsWhat Happened: Trump has begun detaining migrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, expanding the use of the military-run facility originally built for terrorism suspects after 9/11. The plan includes building tent camps and using high-security prison cells for detainees. The first flight of migrants arrived at the base this week.Why It Matters: This move represents a radical escalation in U.S. immigration enforcement, potentially violating legal protections against indefinite detention. It also raises human rights concerns and could set a precedent for using military facilities for civilian detainees. Source: NBC NewsWest Point Shuts Down Clubs for Women and Students of Color Under Trump\u2019s DEI BanWhat Happened: The U.S. Military Academy at West Point has disbanded more than a dozen cadet clubs focused on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order banning DEI programs. The Corbin Forum (a leadership group for female cadets), Spectrum (a gay-straight alliance), and cultural organizations like the Asian-Pacific Forum Club and Latin Cultural Club were shut down. The Defense Department also banned celebrations of cultural awareness months, including Black History Month.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on marginalized communities in the military, dismantling support systems for women and minority cadets. Critics warn it will hurt recruitment, retention, and morale, reversing decades of progress in diversifying military leadership.Source: Associated PressGoogle Scraps Diversity Hiring Goals, Citing Trump\u2019s DEI OrdersWhat Happened: Google has abandoned its diversity hiring goals and is reviewing its DEI programs, citing Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting corporate diversity initiatives. The company removed key DEI language from its SEC filings, signaling a broader shift away from previous commitments. Other tech giants, including Meta, and Amazon, are following suit, dismantling diversity programs under legal and political pressure from conservative groups.Why It Matters: This continues to be a coordinated attack on workplace diversity, forcing corporations to abandon DEI efforts and cutting opportunities for underrepresented groups. Trump\u2019s orders and legal pressure are normalizing corporate compliance with his authoritarian agenda, reversing progress on inclusion.Source: The GuardianTrump signs executive order intended to bar transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sportsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\" directing federal agencies to enforce Title IX based on assigned sex at birth. Schools and athletic organizations allowing transgender women to compete in women\u2019s sports risk losing federal funding. The Education Department\u2014as it faces a shutdown\u2014is now tasked with penalizing non-compliant institutions. Why It Matters: This move further escalates Trump\u2019s crackdown on transgender rights and reverses Biden-era protections for trans students. Public schools and colleges will face federal funding cuts if they do not comply. Source: Associated PressTrump's Aid Freeze Worsens Sudan\u2019s Starvation CrisisWhat Happened: Sudan's civil war has driven over 25 million people into starvation, with 3.2 million children under five suffering from acute malnutrition. Aid groups warn that Trump\u2019s 90-day suspension of U.S. foreign aid could push the crisis into an all-out humanitarian catastrophe. The war, fueled by rival military factions, has turned Sudan into a man-made famine zone.Why It Matters: The U.S. has historically been a major provider of humanitarian aid, and the sudden freeze is leaving millions of Sudanese civilians without food or medical assistance. Trump\u2019s widespread cuts to foreign aid programs are putting thousands of lives at risk and could worsen global instability as famine spreads.Source: CBS NewsTrump Moves to Ban Transgender Athletes from 2028 OlympicsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports, including at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. His regime plans to review visas for elite transgender athletes, claiming it would investigate them for fraud. Trump repeated false claims about athletes from the 2024 Paris Games, accusing them of being transgender without evidence.Why It Matters: This move could jeopardize the U.S.\u2019s role as Olympic host since the International Olympic Committee sets the eligibility rules, not the U.S. government. It also signals an escalation of Trump\u2019s anti-trans policies and will lead to international backlash, lawsuits, and diplomatic tensions with sports governing bodies and foreign governments.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial WatchTrump\u2019s \u2018Gaza Riviera\u2019 Plan Mirrors Kushner\u2019s Real Estate VisionWhat Happened: Trump revived an illegal plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza and redevelop the area into an international luxury resort under U.S. control\u2014an idea that echoes Jared Kushner\u2019s previous remarks about Gaza\u2019s \"valuable waterfront property.\" The proposal has drawn outrage from Palestinians and Western officials. Saudi Arabia and Gulf states have rejected any Gaza investment without a clear pathway to Palestinian statehood.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s rhetoric highlights Trump\u2019s prioritization and enrichment of his family\u2019s real estate development over human rights and international law, further alienating Arab allies and jeopardizing U.S. diplomatic relations in the region. Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsNationwide Protests Erupt Against Trump, Musk, and Project 2025What Happened: Protests in all 50 states rallied Wednesday against Trump\u2019s extremist policies, Project 2025, and Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the government. Protesters gathered at state capitols, city halls, and federal buildings to oppose the regime\u2019s immigration crackdown, LGBTQ+ rollbacks, and plans to forcibly transfer Palestinians from Gaza. The movement, organized under the #BuildTheResistance and #50501 hashtags, aimed to mobilize mass resistance across the country.Source: AP NewsFederal Employees Protest Musk\u2019s Workforce Cuts With Spoon EmojisWhat Happened: Federal employees at the General Services Administration's tech division protested the Trump regime\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d resignation offer by flooding an internal chat with spoon emojis. The offer, modeled after Musk\u2019s Twitter layoffs, encourages employees to resign in exchange for pay through September as part of a massive federal workforce reduction.Source: The New York TimesFederal Judge Blocks Trump\u2019s Birthright Citizenship OrderWhat Happened: A Maryland federal judge has temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, making her the second judge to halt the policy. The order, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to undocumented mothers or temporary visa holders. Immigrants-rights groups and five pregnant women sued, arguing that the order violates the Constitution.Source: CBS NewsJudge Weighs Blocking Musk Allies from Sharing Treasury DataWhat Happened: A federal judge declined to immediately block two of Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE operatives from sharing sensitive Treasury Department financial records with outsiders, including Musk himself. The lawsuit\u2014filed by federal employees\u2014warns that DOGE\u2019s access compromises Treasury\u2019s payment system, which manages billions of transactions. The judge signaled she may impose restrictions on Friday if no agreement is reached.Source: PoliticoJudge Blocks Trump\u2019s Birthright Citizenship Order NationwideWhat Happened: A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order to end birthright citizenship, ruling it blatantly unconstitutional. This follows an earlier ruling by a Seattle judge who temporarily paused the policy for 14 days. Trump's order, set to take effect Feb. 19, sought to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. if neither parent is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers$1.5 Trillion \u2013 Federal healthcare spending that is now under Musk\u2019s control after gaining access to Medicare & Medicaid systems.$5.7 Trillion \u2013 Proposed U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund, with potential Bitcoin stockpiling under Trump\u2019s Crypto Czar.40,000+ \u2013 Federal employees who accepted buyouts, with more layoffs expected.50+ \u2013 Federal workers targeted on a right-wing DEI \u201cwatch list,\u201d many of whom are Black and minority employees.20% \u2013 Portion of CIA budget devoted to China intelligence; now at risk after Trump\u2019s regime exposed new hires.3 Hours \u2013 Time former Coast Guard leader Linda Fagan was given before being forcibly evicted from her home.14 \u2013 DOJ directives signed by AG Pam Bondi, including ending foreign influence probes, purging Jan. 6 investigators, and reinstating the death penalty.26 \u2013 Armed volunteers deputized in Nassau County, NY, as part of an unauthorized civilian militia, now facing a Democratic lawsuit.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 5</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Crypto Czar: U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund May Stockpile Bitcoin</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump\\u2019s Crypto Czar David Sacks confirmed Trump is considering Bitcoin as part of a new $5.7 trillion U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund. The initiative \\u2018aims\\u2019 to boost economic growth and strategic reserves, with incoming Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick seen as a proponent.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This would be the first U.S. government-backed Bitcoin reserve. Critics warn of volatility risks and favoritism toward Trump\\u2019s crypto allies and family.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sovereign-wealth-fund-could-stockpile-bitcoin-trumps-crypto-czar-says/\\\\\\\">Bitcoin</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s DOGE Targets Medicare, Medicaid Offices</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk and his operatives gained access to key payment and contract systems at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees $1.5 trillion in federal health spending. While CMS confirmed ongoing collaboration, it has not clarified whether sensitive medical data is at risk. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>CMS manages Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, covering 150 million Americans. Fake DOGE\\u2019s control over CMS raises privacy concerns, potential healthcare budget cuts, and partisan fears over misuse of data. With Musk and Trump prioritizing cost-cutting, they may also cut benefits under the guise of eliminating fraud.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5129158-elon-musk-cms-access/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOGE Moves to Shield Records from FOIA Scrutiny</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk and his operatives have ordered employees to stop using Slack as it transitions to a new records system that is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. By reclassifying itself under the Executive Office of the President rather than the Office of Management and Budget, fake DOGE aims to limit public and congressional access to its communications. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:  </strong>This move is a blatant effort to obscure communications and evade public scrutiny of potentially illegal actions. As DOGE seizes control of federal agencies, budget systems, private citizen data, and national security infrastructure, it is operating as an unaccountable governing body without legitimate authorization. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.404media.co/doge-employees-ordered-to-stop-using-slack-while-agency-transitions-to-a-records-system-not-subject-to-foia/\\\\\\\">404 Media</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOGE Expands to More Federal Agencies, Gains Access to Health Payment Systems</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk and his operatives have expanded their reach across federal agencies, gaining access to sensitive health payment systems at HHS, CMS, and CDC while also targeting Labor Department records.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s unchecked access to critical health payment systems raises privacy concerns as it handles trillions in Medicare/Medicaid transactions. What exactly are they planning to do with this stolen data?</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/05/doge-health-agencies-labor/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Musk\\u2019s DOGE Engineer Gains NOAA Access, Raising Security Fears</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk\\u2019s operatives placed Nikhil Rajpal, an ex-Twitter and Tesla engineer, inside NOAA. Ordered by acting Commerce Secretary Jeremy Pelter, NOAA staff were told to grant Rajpal full access to internal systems.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>NOAA is critical for climate research and disaster forecasting. Giving an unqualified, unvetted Musk operative control risks data manipulation, aligning with Project 2025\\u2019s push to privatize weather services and weaken climate science.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-engineer-noaa-data-google-musk-climate-project-2025/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Elon Musk Aide Is Now Working at VA and Accessing Its Computer Systems</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has raised red flags that Elon Musk and his operatives may have gained unauthorized access to veterans\\u2019 private health records at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Murray warned that DOGE\\u2019s reckless intrusion into federal agencies could endanger the health and privacy of millions of veterans, especially as Musk\\u2019s team has already accessed sensitive financial and personnel data at the Treasury Department and Office of Personnel Management.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>With access to veterans' medical and financial records, DOGE can compromise VA healthcare policies, target specific groups of veterans, or misuse sensitive medical data. Lawsuits are already mounting against Musk\\u2019s illegal data mining operations, with federal unions suing the Treasury for giving Musk\\u2019s operatives full access to the government's payment systems. This power grab is an unprecedented breach of federal oversight and should raise alarms about national security, privacy, and political abuse.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/05/elon-musk-aide-now-working-va-and-accessing-its-computer-systems.html\\\\\\\">Military .com</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Regime Moves to Politicize Federal CIO Positions</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Office of Personnel Management issued a memo recommending that Chief Information Officers be reclassified from \\u201Ccareer reserved\\u201D to \\u201Cgeneral employees,\\u201D making them political appointees rather than impartial career officials. This move would allow the regime to install political loyalists, including Musk-aligned tech figures, into critical IT roles. Agencies have until February 14 to comply with the reclassification.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is part of Trump\\u2019s broader effort to purge civil servants and consolidate power through his Schedule F initiative. Politicizing federal CIOs\\u2014who oversee cybersecurity, AI, and data security\\u2014will put critical government infrastructure at risk. The move would allow Musk and his operatives to take control of federal IT policies, including AI deployment and data management. This will compromise government cybersecurity, centralize tech decisions under political influence, and enable misuse of federal data.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://fedscoop.com/opm-reclassify-chief-information-officers-career-politics/\\\\\\\">FedScoop</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Expands Intelligence Buyouts, Raising Fears of Politicized Spy Agencies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has extended buyout offers to employees across multiple U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, NSA, ODNI, NGA, and NRO, as part of Trump and Elon Musk\\u2019s drive to seize federal agencies. Former intelligence officials and lawmakers fear mass purges will lead to the replacement of experienced analysts with Trump loyalists who shape intelligence to fit his policies and carry out illegal acts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Cutting veteran intelligence officers threatens national security, weakens intelligence-gathering capabilities, and risks turning agencies into politicized tools. Trump has long clashed with the intelligence community over findings that Russia interfered in multiple U.S. elections to help him. The buyouts will erode independent intelligence assessments, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to foreign threats.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-expands-buyout-offers-more-spy-agencies-officials-say-2025-02-05/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Emil Bove: The Lawyer Behind Trump\\u2019s DOJ Overhaul</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Emil Bove, Trump\\u2019s former criminal defense lawyer, is now acting deputy attorney general, leading sweeping changes at the Justice Department. Bove has fired Jan. 6th prosecutors, ordered investigations into local officials who refuse to assist federal immigration authorities, and is overseeing a crackdown on \\u201Cdeep state\\u201D prosecutors. He is expected to become Deputy AG once Todd Blanche\\u2014another Trump defense attorney\\u2014is confirmed as Attorney General Pam Bondi\\u2019s top deputy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Bove\\u2019s rapid restructuring of the DOJ aligns with Trump\\u2019s revenge-driven agenda, particularly targeting those involved in the Jan. 6 prosecutions. Trump and his loyalists are politicizing law enforcement to protect Trump and target his opponents.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-team-revamps-us-justice-department-with-his-former-personal-lawyer-at-helm-2025-02-05/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>U.S. AI Safety Institute Director Resigns Amid Trump\\u2019s AI Overhaul</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elizabeth Kelly, director of the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), has resigned, leaving the future of the agency uncertain under the Trump regime. Kelly, appointed under Biden, led initiatives to test AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic and collaborated with global AI safety bodies. Trump has already revoked Biden\\u2019s 2023 AI executive order.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Kelly\\u2019s departure signals a potential shift in AI governance, most likely weakening federal oversight of AI risks. With Trump\\u2019s regime prioritizing deregulation, AI development will proceed without the necessary safeguards. The AI industry, already facing ethical and security challenges, could now see looser government controls, increasing the risk of unchecked and dangerous AI proliferation.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong>Reuters</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s DOGE to Overhaul Air Traffic Control System</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk announced that he will implement rapid safety upgrades to the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control system. The move follows a recent FAA system outage and a deadly midair collision near Reagan National Airport that killed 67 people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed fake DOGE\\u2019s involvement in overseeing the system.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Musk\\u2019s direct control over FAA safety infrastructure raises concerns about privatization, oversight, and cybersecurity risks. With unauthorized DOGE expanding across federal agencies, Musk continues to increase his influence over critical national infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5129134-el-musk-urges-quick-safety-upgrades-faa/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Pam Bondi\\u2019s First Moves as Attorney General Reshape DOJ</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Newly sworn-in Attorney General Pam Bondi issued 14 directives immediately after taking office, focusing on reversing Trump-era investigations, reshaping immigration enforcement, dismantling DEI programs, and reinstating the federal death penalty. Bondi is closing the FBI\\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force, investigating prosecutors who pursued Trump, and pausing grants to sanctuary cities and organizations assisting undocumented immigrants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Bondi\\u2019s DOJ is aggressively targeting Trump\\u2019s past legal adversaries, expanding immigration crackdowns, and eliminating civil rights programs. The closure of the Foreign Influence Task Force weakens oversight of foreign meddling, and reinstating the death penalty signals a harsher criminal justice stance and intentionally tweaking national security. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/05/pam-bondi-issued-a-flurry-of-orders-on-day-1-as-trumps-attorney-general-00202756\\\\\\\">POLITICO</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>White House Orders CIA to Release Employee List, Raising Security Fears</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The White House ordered the CIA to send an <strong>unclassified</strong> email listing names and initials of employees hired in the past two years as part of Trump's federal workforce reduction. The list included new analysts and operatives focused on China, raising counterintelligence concerns about potential leaks to adversaries like China and Russia.</p><p>\\u201CThe list included first names and the first initial of the last name of the new hires, who are still on probation \\u2014 and thus easy to dismiss. It included a large crop of young analysts and operatives who were hired specifically to focus on China, and whose identities are usually closely guarded because Chinese hackers are constantly seeking to identify them.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Former officials warn this move is a \\u201Ccounterintelligence disaster,\\u201D as foreign intelligence agencies could exploit the data. The CIA\\u2019s China-focused recruits\\u2014a growing priority\\u2014could be disproportionately affected. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/cia-names-list.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump regime evicts former Coast Guard leader from her house with 3 hours notice</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Former Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, the first woman to lead a U.S. military branch, was forcibly evicted from her military housing on Tuesday with just three hours notice. Fagan, who was fired by Trump on his second day in office for her \\u201Cexcessive focus\\u201D on DEI and border security policies, was given a 60-day waiver to find new housing\\u2014until DHS abruptly revoked it at Trump's request. DHS officials even demanded interior photos of her residence, a move insiders called \\u201Ca strange power play.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This high-profile, punitive eviction sends a chilling message to career military leaders who don\\u2019t align with Trump\\u2019s agenda, demonstrating his willingness to humiliate and retaliate against even four-star admirals. A classic authoritarian tactic.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-administration-evicts-former-coast-guard-linda-fagan-3-hours-rcna190820\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Republicans Block Subpoena for Musk as DOGE Seizes Government Data</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Congressional Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to subpoena Elon Musk to testify about his fake DOGE and its unauthorized access to federal data and spending freezes. Despite protests demanding accountability, Musk has remained out of public view since Trump\\u2019s inauguration and continues to slash agency budgets, freeze funding, and access sensitive government systems.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Musk\\u2019s unchecked authority over federal operations raises major concerns about government transparency, financial manipulation, and national security. As a \\u201Cspecial government employee,\\u201D Musk is not an official U.S. officer but is gutting agencies and purging federal workers without congressional oversight. With Republicans shielding him from testimony, Democrats warn this sets a dangerous precedent for unelected billionaires seizing control of the government.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-musk-congressional-subpoena-doge-continues-access/story?id=118487749\\\\\\\"> </a><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-musk-congressional-subpoena-doge-continues-access/story?id=118487749\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump DOJ Targets FBI, Jan. 6 Investigators</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> AG Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Emil Bove moved to purge FBI officials who investigated Jan. 6 rioters, accusing acting FBI leaders of \\u2018insubordination\\u2019 for resisting. Bondi also launched a working group to investigate officials who pursued Trump-related prosecutions, including the Manhattan DA and the NY Attorney General.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump is turning the DOJ into his personal enforcer, intimidating FBI agents, dismantling independent law enforcement, and shielding himself from accountability. He is using the DOJ to go after officials involved in cases against him and his cronies but will shift to going after the opposition. This mirrors the tactics of Russia\\u2019s law enforcement and the Prosecutor General\\u2019s office.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/justice-dept-fbi-insubordination.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>FCC Publishes CBS\\u2019 Kamala Harris Interview, Dismissing Trump\\u2019s \\u2018Election Interference\\u2019 Claims</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The FCC released the full transcript of Kamala Harris\\u2019 contested \\u201860 Minutes\\u2019 interview, disproving Trump\\u2019s claims that CBS doctored the footage to favor Democrats. The unedited transcript confirms standard editing practices, not manipulation. Despite this, FCC Chair Brendan Carr\\u2014a Trump ally\\u2014extended the case for public comment through March, keeping pressure on CBS.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The FCC\\u2019s revival of Trump\\u2019s complaint highlights that the agency is being weaponized to attack media outlets critical of Trump. With probes into NPR, PBS, and other networks underway, the FCC is undermining press freedom to silence opposition. Meanwhile, Paramount Global, CBS\\u2019 parent company, is reportedly considering settling Trump\\u2019s lawsuit to secure government approval for its merger, illustrating the chilling effect of Trump\\u2019s influence.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/media/cbs-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOJ Drops Case Against Project Veritas Over Ashley Biden\\u2019s Diary</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Justice Department declined to charge Project Veritas over its role in acquiring and attempting to publish Ashley Biden\\u2019s stolen diary before the 2020 election. Despite years of investigation and FBI searches, the DOJ did not explain its decision.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move highlights the DOJ backing off cases involving Trump allies, as Project Veritas has long supported him. At the same time, Trump\\u2019s DOJ is aggressively targeting his political opponents, using the justice system to shield his allies while punishing those who investigated or prosecuted him, further cementing the department\\u2019s role as a tool for his authoritarian agenda.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/justice-dept-says-it-will-not-bring-charges-in-investigation-of-project-veritas.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Revokes Security Detail for Former Defense Officials</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Defense Department revoked former Defense Secretary Mark Esper\\u2019s security detail Tuesday night, following similar removals for Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Brian Hook. Esper, who has received credible threats from Iran over the 2020 assassination of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, is the latest official from Trump\\u2019s first term to lose government protection. Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley also had his security detail revoked last week, along with his security clearance, and the Pentagon removed his portrait from its walls.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Stripping security from high-risk former officials\\u2014particularly those targeted by foreign adversaries\\u2014raises concerns about retaliation threats, national security risks, and Trump\\u2019s use of power to punish former critics. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-defense-secretary-mark-esper-security-detail/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Right-Wing Group Targets Federal Workers in \\u2018D.E.I. Watch List\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The American Accountability Foundation published a watch list of over 50 federal employees involved in DEI initiatives, calling for Trump to fire them. The list includes names, photos, and accusations based on political donations, social media activity, and past work on health equity. Many targeted workers are black employees in health agencies like the CDC and NIH.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This escalates the far-right's war on career civil servants beyond just eliminating DEI offices. The list exposes federal employees to harassment and threats. With Trump sycophants leading this dangerous push, we need to watch if these tactics spread to other agencies, states, and private companies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/dei-watchlist-federal-health-workers-cdc-nih.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Picks Joe Kent to Lead U.S. Counterterrorism Center</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump appointed Joe Kent as director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Kent, a former Green Beret and CIA officer, has defended Jan. 6 insurrectionists as \\\\\\\"political prisoners\\\\\\\" and has ties to a former Proud Boys member.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues to reshape intelligence leadership with loyalists who have attacked federal agencies. This is a classic authoritarian move to install allies in key positions who will prioritize loyalty over the law, ensuring they carry out his orders\\u2014even if they are illegal or compromise national security. This politicization of intelligence threatens the integrity of U.S. security operations and enables unchecked executive power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trumps-pick-lead-national-counterterrorism-center-called-jan-6-rioters-rcna190765\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Democrats sue GOP county executive over armed volunteer unit they say amounts to an illegal militia</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Democrats in Nassau County, NY, sued Republican County Executive Bruce Blakeman over his creation of an armed volunteer unit\\u2014shrouded in secrecy\\u2014calling it an illegal militia. They argue that state law only allows trained law enforcement officers to be deputized, not private citizens. The lawsuit challenges the lack of transparency, as Blakeman\\u2019s office has refused to disclose who is being recruited, their training, weapons, or taxpayer costs. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This case raises major concerns about untrained civilians wielding police power, especially in a county with one of the largest police forces in the U.S., and Trump allies seeking to form private militia groups. Deputizing armed volunteers blurs the line between law enforcement and political militias, a growing trend under GOP leadership.</p><blockquote><p>We need to watch for similar efforts in other counties and states, as Republican officials push expanded use of militia groups amid federal rollbacks on civil rights protections.<em> </em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Source:</strong><em><strong> <a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/new-york-armed-deputies-nassau-long-island-4708d686358458a3e29aecfa22a18758\\\\\\\">AP</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Considers Labeling Migrants a Measles, Tuberculosis Risk</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is exploring ways to invoke Title 42\\u2014the emergency health law used during the COVID-19 pandemic\\u2014to ban asylum seekers at the southern border under the pretext of measles and tuberculosis outbreaks. Trump officials are deploying health officers to the border and examining disease cases to justify reintroducing the controversial policy. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move weaponizes public health laws to justify circumventing asylum protections, a tactic courts previously ruled against. Public health experts warn that existing medical measures\\u2014such as vaccinations and screenings\\u2014are sufficient, making this a politically motivated immigration crackdown rather than a genuine health response. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-asylum-seekers-measles-tuberculosis-risk-0e71a539?reflink=article_copyURL_share&amp;st=TpJero\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump plans to use notorious Guant\\u00E1namo detention facility and nearby tents to hold immigrants</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has begun detaining migrants at Guant\\u00E1namo Bay, expanding the use of the military-run facility originally built for terrorism suspects after 9/11. The plan includes building tent camps and using high-security prison cells for detainees. The first flight of migrants arrived at the base this week.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move represents a radical escalation in U.S. immigration enforcement, potentially violating legal protections against indefinite detention. It also raises human rights concerns and could set a precedent for using military facilities for civilian detainees. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-plans-use-notorious-guantanamo-detention-facility-nearby-t-rcna190707\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>West Point Shuts Down Clubs for Women and Students of Color Under Trump\\u2019s DEI Ban</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point has disbanded more than a dozen cadet clubs focused on gender, race, ethnicity, and sexuality to comply with Trump\\u2019s executive order banning DEI programs. The Corbin Forum (a leadership group for female cadets), Spectrum (a gay-straight alliance), and cultural organizations like the Asian-Pacific Forum Club and Latin Cultural Club were shut down. The Defense Department also banned celebrations of cultural awareness months, including Black History Month.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct attack on marginalized communities in the military, dismantling support systems for women and minority cadets. Critics warn it will hurt recruitment, retention, and morale, reversing decades of progress in diversifying military leadership.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/west-point-student-clubs-diversity-trump-dei-a8e992f1bbceda4bf217db6dfebd6b92\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Google Scraps Diversity Hiring Goals, Citing Trump\\u2019s DEI Orders</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Google has abandoned its diversity hiring goals and is reviewing its DEI programs, citing Trump\\u2019s executive orders targeting corporate diversity initiatives. The company removed key DEI language from its SEC filings, signaling a broader shift away from previous commitments. Other tech giants, including Meta, and Amazon, are following suit, dismantling diversity programs under legal and political pressure from conservative groups.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This continues to be a coordinated attack on workplace diversity, forcing corporations to abandon DEI efforts and cutting opportunities for underrepresented groups.

His regime plans to review visas for elite transgender athletes, claiming it would investigate them for fraud. Trump repeated false claims about athletes from the 2024 Paris Games, accusing them of being transgender without evidence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This move could jeopardize the U.S.\\u2019s role as Olympic host since the International Olympic Committee sets the eligibility rules, not the U.S. government.
