President Trump has mused openly about expanding the deployments to other cities, particularly Democratic strongholds.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 19Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Julie Roginsky and I are so excited to announce our Fall 2025 seminar: a 6-week discussion on information warfare, disinformation, and media manipulation\u2014 exclusively for our paid subscribers.Starts: Wednesday, September 17 at 3:00 PM ETMeets: Weekly on Wednesdays (Sept 17\u2013Oct 22)Format: Zoom Zoom link will be sent separately on Wednesday at 2:30 PM ET. Cut-off for registration is September 17 at 2:00 PM ET.Slides will be emailed the following day\u2026Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccVY1gdQvAJLIsN8ahz0oRRl1bsyqDupu1Ixx5SEcWZLZ6kg/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump National Doral returns to PGA Tour in 2026 with Miami ChampionshipWhat Happened: The PGA Tour announced it will return to Trump National Doral for the first time since 2016, hosting a new Miami Championship from April 30\u2013May 3, 2026. Why It Matters: Trump is using the PGA Tour\u2019s return to Doral to fuse his presidency with his business empire. The move shows how major sports organizations are helping normalize his brand despite glaring conflicts of interest and political baggage.Source: USA TodayElon Musk Pledged to Start a Political Party. He Is Already Pumping the Brakes.What Happened: Elon Musk has pulled back from launching his proposed \u201cAmerica Party,\u201d telling allies he wants to focus on his businesses and avoid splitting GOP voters. Instead, he\u2019s working to maintain ties with JD Vance and may funnel money into a future Vance presidential run.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s retreat preserves his influence inside MAGA while his companies rack up lucrative federal contracts under Trump, blurring the line between policy and profiteering. His billions are embedding corporate power and corruption deeper into America\u2019s political system.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump businesses seek to hire more foreign workers as his administration supercharges deportationsWhat Happened: Even as Trump\u2019s $75 billion immigration crackdown makes ICE the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the U.S., his luxury clubs are hiring foreign seasonal workers. Job postings at Trump properties in West Palm Beach and Bedminster seek cooks, servers, and bartenders through the H-2B visa program.Why It Matters: The hypocrisy is glaring\u2014Trump is jailing and disappearing immigrants while shielding industries that benefit his own empire. His immigration agenda isn\u2019t about protecting U.S. workers but about consolidating power, enriching allies, and carving out exceptions for himself.Source: CREW\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump and Putin are both criticizing mail-in voting. Election officials are freaking out.What Happened: After meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Trump announced plans to ban mail-in ballots and eliminate voting machines. Election officials warn this would cripple U.S. elections, invite chaos, and hand Russia new openings to interfere.Why It Matters: Russia has been attacking our elections for over a decade, and now Trump is echoing Putin\u2019s propaganda while dismantling safeguards. By eroding trust and weakening defenses, he\u2019s handing Moscow exactly what it wants\u2014a broken American democracy\u2014as he consolidates power.Source: PoliticoA Texas County Cuts Over 100 Polling Sites as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting NationallyWhat Happened: Tarrant County, Texas, voted to cut more than 100 polling sites and reduce early voting, just one day after Trump vowed to end mail-in ballots. Officials claimed the move would save money and improve efficiency, but it disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, and student-heavy areas.Why It Matters: This is more voter suppression. With Trump pushing a national crackdown on mail-in voting, Texas Republicans are shrinking in-person access too\u2014making it harder for working-class and minority voters to cast a ballot.Source: ProPublicaTrump budget officials claim sweeping spending power from Congress, records showWhat Happened: Newly released records show Trump\u2019s budget chief, Russell Vought, is blocking billions in congressionally approved funds for housing, education, and research unless agencies prove compliance with Trump\u2019s directives, like bans on diversity programs. This practice effectively gives Vought veto power over nearly all federal spending.Why It Matters: The move centralizes financial authority in the White House, undermining Congress\u2019s constitutional power of the purse. It revives Trump\u2019s first-term tactics\u2014like freezing Ukraine aid\u2014that were deemed unlawful. This cements Project 2025\u2019s vision of executive control over federal budgets.Source: Washington PostTrump bypasses the Senate \u2014 and the courts \u2014 to install loyal US attorneysWhat Happened: Trump is bypassing Senate confirmation and even judicial appointments to keep loyalists in charge of U.S. attorney offices in states including New Jersey, New York, California, Nevada, and New Mexico. Using loopholes, the regime is reappointing unconfirmed picks as \u201cacting\u201d U.S. attorneys, letting them serve nearly a year without oversight.Why It Matters: This shreds constitutional checks and hands Trump direct control of federal prosecutors to target his enemies. By converting U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices into partisan outposts, he is weaponizing the justice system and accelerating the collapse of the rule of law.Source: PoliticoTrump Targets Corporate America to Achieve Economic and Foreign Policy GoalsWhat Happened: Trump is forcing Nvidia and AMD to hand the U.S. government 15% of AI chip sales to China, considering a 10% federal stake in Intel, and claiming a \u201cGolden Share\u201d in Nippon Steel to control U.S. Steel. His team is also driving Pentagon equity buys in rare earth firms, pulling the government directly into corporate boardrooms.Why It Matters: This marks a sharp turn toward state-directed capitalism modeled on Russia and China. Trump frames it as industrial policy, but it is extortion\u2014endangering taxpayer money, destabilizing markets, and giving him power over corporations.Source: Bloomberg\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTennessee Becomes Latest Republican-Led State to Send National Guard to D.C.What Happened: Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is sending 160 Guard troops to Washington, joining five other GOP states in backing Trump\u2019s takeover of D.C. policing. Trump claims a crime crisis, though data shows the city has grown safer in the past two years.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the Guard as a political tool and setting the stage for wider city occupations. It squanders resources, erodes federalism, and accelerates his authoritarian power grab. D.C. is a test case as the police state expands.Source: New York TimesTexas Democrat Forced to Sleep in Capitol After Refusing 24-Hour Police EscortWhat Happened: Texas Rep. Nicole Collier is suing after GOP leaders ordered her confined to the Capitol under threat of arrest unless she accepted a 24/7 police escort. She refused and slept on the House floor with colleagues after a quorum-denying trip to block Trump-backed redistricting.Why It Matters: This is coercion\u2014using police power to detain lawmakers and force through maps that dilute Black voting power. Republicans are criminalizing opposition and turning legislatures into prisons to cement one-party rule.Source: Mother JonesJustice Department investigating D.C. police over alleged fake crime dataWhat Happened: Federal prosecutors, led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, are investigating whether D.C. police \u201cmanipulated\u201d crime data to make violent crime appear lower. The probe follows Trump\u2019s federal takeover of the city\u2019s law enforcement, with local officials citing falling crime to resist his intervention.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the probe to claim D.C. leaders lied about crime, even though there is zero evidence of fake data. It\u2019s another manufactured excuse to justify his police takeover and push the city deeper under federal control.Source: Washington PostIn Pursuing Trump Rival, Weaponization Czar Sidesteps Justice Dept. NormsWhat Happened: Edward R. Martin Jr., Trump\u2019s \u201cweaponization\u201d chief, is pressuring New York AG Letitia James to resign, posed outside her home before attacking her on Fox News. His actions came amid a DOJ probe into James over \u201cmortgage fraud.\u201dWhy It Matters: Martin\u2019s stunts show Trump has turned the DOJ into a weapon to intimidate his enemies. The blatant politicization erodes trust in the department and risks collapsing criminal cases.Source: New York TimesJeanine Pirro bragged about helping Trump and GOP while a Fox News hostWhat Happened: Newly unredacted documents in the Smartmatic defamation case reveal Jeanine Pirro texted GOP leaders in 2020 that she was \u201cworking hard for the President and party,\u201d despite Fox\u2019s \u201cban\u201d on partisan activity. She amplified election lies on-air even as she privately admitted Biden won fairly\u2014and secured a Trump pardon for her ex-husband. Why It Matters: Pirro used her Fox platform to serve Trump\u2019s interests and lie to the public, and she now holds one of the most powerful prosecutorial posts in the country. Trump continues installing loyalists to weaponize the justice system against his enemies.Source: Washington PostCalifornia's long ballot count may be Trump's next target in the war over votingWhat Happened: Trump renewed his push to end mail-in voting, calling for an all-paper, in-person system he claims delivers \u201ccertainty\u201d on election night. The move zeroes in on California, where 81% of votes were cast by mail in 2024 and slow counts left House control undecided for weeks.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing California\u2019s slow counts as part of his war on voting, setting up mail ballots as the next target alongside redistricting battles. By framing delays as \u201cfraud,\u201d he\u2019s laying groundwork to delegitimize results and tighten GOP control through gerrymanders and voting rollbacks.Source: NBC NewsIRS broke rules in firing probationary employees, Treasury Department watchdog findsWhat Happened: A Treasury watchdog found the IRS broke its own rules when it purged 6,700 probationary employees on Trump\u2019s orders, skipping required notice and ignoring performance reviews. Officials lied that the cuts were based on performance.Why It Matters: The purge gutted a new IRS unit tasked with auditing the wealthy and complex partnerships, crippling tax enforcement. By bending rules to purge these hires, Trump weaponized the bureaucracy to shield the rich and punish oversight.Source: The HillEducation Department threatens funding for Northern Virginia schools over trans student policiesWhat Happened: The Education Department moved to strip $50 million from five Northern Virginia school districts for refusing to roll back protections for transgender students. Officials claim restroom and pronoun policies violate Title IX.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing federal funds to enforce his war on trans rights, coercing schools into \u201cbiology-based\u201d rules. The move strips resources from entire districts and is part of a broader attack on education to impose ideological conformity\u2014while endangering LGBTQ+ students.Source: The HillSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Says Smithsonian Focuses Too Much on \u2018How Bad Slavery Was\u2019What Happened: Trump accused the Smithsonian of \u201coverstating\u201d slavery\u2019s horrors and ordered museums to rewrite exhibits to reflect his regime\u2019s view of \u201cAmerican ideals.\u201d Institutions have 120 days to change tone and framing, part of Trump\u2019s push to sanitize history, erase diversity, and restore Confederate symbols.Why It Matters: This is state-imposed historical revisionism\u2014whitewashing the horrors of slavery to stoke white grievance and erase Black history. It mirrors Russia\u2019s playbook of rewriting history to  glorify the \u201cempire,\u201d rewrite borders, and suppress inconvenient truths and historical mass crimes and genocide.Source: New York TimesOklahoma will test some incoming teachers with \u2018America-first\u2019 examWhat Happened: Oklahoma will force teaching applicants from New York and California to pass a 50-question \u201cAmerica First\u201d test created by PragerU on civics, religion, and gender. Superintendent Ryan Walters says it\u2019s meant to block \u201cwoke indoctrinators\u201d despite a dire teacher shortage.Why It Matters: This weaponizes teacher certification to impose right-wing ideology, driving out qualified educators and turning schools into political battlegrounds. It mirrors Trump\u2019s broader push to purge dissent from education and enforce ideological conformity.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsCommunity rallies around LA teen detained by Ice while walking dogWhat Happened: ICE agents in masks detained 18-year-old Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz in Van Nuys just days after his birthday, as he walked his dog before starting senior year. Supporters call it a kidnapping and say he now faces inhumane conditions in detention.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s state-sponsored cruelty is ripping students from classrooms and terrorizing immigrant communities. Guerrero-Cruz\u2019s detention shows how everyday life can turn into disappearance, spreading fear in communities.Source: The GuardianNebraska governor announces plan for immigrant detention center to aid in Trump's deportation effortsWhat Happened: Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen will convert a prison camp in McCook into a federal immigration internment center, the \u201cCornhusker Clink,\u201d to hold up to 300 detainees with state patrol and Guard support. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s $45 billion ICE expansion and growing network of detention sites.Why It Matters: Trump is building a mass-detention system, locking immigrants in remote internment camps far from oversight. Facilities like \u201cCornhusker Clink\u201d and \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d normalize incarceration as intimidation, eroding due process, and targeting vulnerable communities.Source: CBS NewsThe Founders of This New Development Say You Must Be White to Live ThereWhat Happened: A group in Ravenden, Arkansas, has created a whites-only community called Return to the Land, screening applicants through ancestry checks and even family photos to ensure \u201cEuropean heritage.\u201d The founders argue they qualify for exemptions under housing law, even as the state attorney general investigates and experts say the policy is a blatant violation of the Fair Housing Act.Why It Matters: This is a test case for white nationalists exploiting Trump-era rollbacks of civil rights protections. By normalizing whites-only housing, extremists are pushing segregationist projects into the mainstream under a regime advancing the same agenda.Source: New York TimesMaine police officer arrested by ICE agrees to voluntarily leave the countryWhat Happened: ICE arrested Maine police officer Jon Luke Evans, a Jamaican national, for allegedly overstaying his visa and attempting to buy a firearm. Though DHS had cleared him to work through E-Verify, a judge ordered him to leave the U.S., which he accepted.Why It Matters: The case highlights contradictions in Trump\u2019s immigration regime\u2014first approving, then targeting a local officer. The crackdown is sowing chaos even in law-and-order roles, eroding trust in both immigration systems and community policing.Source: CNNIce used Marriott chain to detain immigrants, despite hotel\u2019s 2019 pledge not to cooperateWhat Happened: ICE used a Sheraton hotel in Louisiana to detain a father and son before deporting them to Ecuador, despite Marriott\u2019s 2019 pledge not to aid immigration enforcement. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine is pulling private businesses into its orbit, breaking corporate promises under political pressure. Turning hotels into covert detention sites erodes public trust and normalizes mass roundups.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTop Air Force general to exit in latest shake-up at PentagonWhat Happened: Gen. David Allvin, the Air Force chief of staff, will retire halfway through his four-year term after reportedly being pushed out by Trump officials. His exit follows a string of senior military purges, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Navy chief, the Coast Guard commandant, and other top brass.Why It Matters: Trump is hollowing out the Pentagon\u2019s leadership, sidelining experienced commanders in favor of loyalists. This destabilizes military continuity and endangers national security at a moment of global crisis, weakening trust inside the armed forces and among U.S. allies.Source: Washington PostGun violence hits Black communities hardest. Trump is rolling back prevention effortsWhat Happened: Gun violence has surged in Black communities like Bogalusa, Louisiana, where firearm homicide rates are higher than the national average. Instead of strengthening prevention, Trump rolled back Biden-era gun safety measures, gutted intervention funding, repealed ATF oversight of dealers, and cut research into firearm deaths.Why It Matters: Black youth are dying at staggering rates while Trump dismantles public health efforts to curb shootings. His policies enrich the gun industry, weaken protections, and leave communities already scarred by poverty and racism to face more trauma and death.Source: NPRTrump Tariffs and Green Energy Rollbacks Drive Up Power Bills 10%What Happened: A new report shows household electricity bills have risen 10% since Trump took office, driven by tariffs, data center growth, and cuts to clean energy incentives. Average prices jumped from 15.95 to 17.47 cents per kWh in five months, with spikes up to 20% in some states.Why It Matters: Trump promised cheaper power, but his pro-fossil fuel agenda is making energy costlier and less reliable. Families are footing the bill while his regime shields donors and dismantles climate policies.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Get-Tough Approach on Homelessness May Sweep Up VeteransWhat Happened: Trump ended support for Housing First, the model behind HUD-VASH that cut veteran homelessness by more than half. Advocates warn shifting to \u201ctreatment first\u201d could strip housing from thousands of vets.Why It Matters: HUD-VASH is hailed as a major success, keeping 170,000 veterans housed. Weakening it risks pushing vulnerable vets with PTSD and addiction back onto the streets and undoing years of progress.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUS destroyers head toward waters off Venezuela as Trump aims to pressure drug cartelsWhat Happened: The U.S. is deploying three guided-missile destroyers off Venezuela as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cnarco-terrorism\u201d campaign, which also labeled cartels as terrorist groups and doubled the bounty on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to $50 million. The move marks a sharp military escalation in Latin America.Why It Matters: Trump is blurring the line between law enforcement and warfare by treating cartels like ISIS and targeting Maduro\u2019s regime. The strategy risks confrontation in Venezuelan waters.Source: Associated PressIran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Defies US and IsraelWhat Happened: Despite heavy Israeli and U.S. strikes that killed commanders and crippled defenses, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard emerged from the 12-day war stronger. It tightened control at home, secured new seats on Iran\u2019s National Defense Council, and positioned itself as the regime\u2019s indispensable economic and military arm.Why It Matters: The IRGC\u2019s deeper entrenchment makes it harder for the U.S. and Israel to weaken Iran\u2019s influence. With regional proxies weakened, Tehran may accelerate the pursuit of a nuclear deterrent\u2014raising the stakes for future conflict.Source: BloombergStudent Arrivals to US Continue to Plummet, With Asia Hit Especially HardWhat Happened: Student visa arrivals fell 28% in July, with India down 46% and China 26%. Universities expect first-time foreign enrollment to drop 30% this fall, costing an estimated $2.6 billion in lost tuition.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s visa crackdowns are choking off international students, intentionally gutting a vital revenue stream for U.S. universities. The decline threatens school finances and America\u2019s standing as a global hub for education.Source: Bloomberg\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Administration Speechwriter Linked to Hate Speech OnlineWhat Happened: A DHS speechwriter, Eric Lendrum, was exposed for spreading hate speech and extremist conspiracy theories online, including defending January 6 insurrectionists, promoting the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory, and comparing conservatives to Jews in Nazi Germany. His posts also encouraged violence against pro-Palestinian protesters and attacked LGBTQ+ people.Why It Matters: This shows how extremists are being normalized and placed inside the government. By elevating voices who peddle hate and violence, Trump is embedding far-right ideology into federal agencies.Source: Guardian\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump's tariffs are leaving Black beauty businesses in perilWhat Happened: Black-owned beauty salons and wholesalers are being hit hard by Trump\u2019s steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, where most hair extensions and supplies are made. Prices on hair essentials have doubled, forcing small business owners to delay shipments, hike prices, or absorb devastating losses.Why It Matters: By driving up costs in an industry that sustains thousands of small businesses, Trump\u2019s trade war is crushing livelihoods and deepening economic inequality.Source: ReutersTrump Widens Metal Tariffs to Target Baby Gear and MotorcyclesWhat Happened: Trump abruptly widened steel and aluminum tariffs to cover more than 400 consumer items, including motorcycles, baby products, and tableware. The move took effect Monday without exemptions for goods already in transit, leaving importers and customs brokers scrambling to comply.Why It Matters: The erratic tariffs are another shock to global supply chains, driving up costs for everyday goods and fueling market chaos. Trump\u2019s trade war is spreading from heavy industry to household products, deepening economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers.Source: BloombergBusinesses face 'chaos' as EPA aims to repeal its authority over climate pollutionWhat Happened: EPA is moving to repeal its landmark 2009 \u201cendangerment finding\u201d that greenhouse gases threaten public health, the legal basis for all federal climate regulations. Businesses warn the move could trigger regulatory chaos and unleash costly lawsuits, even as EPA chief Lee Zeldin calls it \u201ca dagger to the heart of the climate change religion.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is one of the largest deregulatory actions in U.S. history. By gutting climate authority, Trump is erasing science, destabilizing corporate planning, and locking America into more pollution\u2014all to satisfy ideological hardliners while even industry groups ask for stability.Source: NPREconomic Data Has Taken a Dark Turn. That Doesn\u2019t Mean a Crash Is Near.What Happened: Inflation is rising again, and job growth has slowed as Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs and immigration crackdown ripple through the economy. Import costs are rising, consumer confidence is faltering, and foreign investors are hesitating, though economists say a recession isn\u2019t guaranteed yet.Why It Matters: Tariffs and mass deportations are driving up prices and straining the labor force, undermining stability. Even if a crash is avoided, Trump\u2019s policies are steering the economy into dangerous ground where persistent inflation collides with weaker job prospects.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501The Race to Rescue PBS and NPR StationsWhat Happened: After Trump\u2019s cuts wiped out $500 million in federal funding for public broadcasting, the Knight Foundation and other major philanthropies launched a $50 million Public Media Bridge Fund.

Election officials warn this would cripple U.S. elections, invite chaos, and hand Russia new openings to interfere.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Russia has been attacking our elections for over a decade, and now Trump is echoing Putin\\u2019s propaganda while dismantling safeguards.

Officials claimed the move would save money and improve efficiency, but it disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, and student-heavy areas.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is more voter suppression.

This practice effectively gives Vought veto power over nearly all federal spending.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The move centralizes financial authority in the White House, undermining Congress\\u2019s constitutional power of the purse. It revives Trump\\u2019s first-term tactics\\u2014like freezing Ukraine aid\\u2014that were deemed unlawful.

Using loopholes, the regime is reappointing unconfirmed picks as \\u201Cacting\\u201D U.S. attorneys, letting them serve nearly a year without oversight.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This shreds constitutional checks and hands Trump direct control of federal prosecutors to target his enemies.

His team is also driving Pentagon equity buys in rare earth firms, pulling the government directly into corporate boardrooms.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This marks a sharp turn toward state-directed capitalism modeled on Russia and China.

Trump claims a crime crisis, though data shows the city has grown safer in the past two years.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the Guard as a political tool and setting the stage for wider city occupations.

She refused and slept on the House floor with colleagues after a quorum-denying trip to block Trump-backed redistricting.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is coercion\\u2014using police power to detain lawmakers and force through maps that dilute Black voting power.

The probe follows Trump\\u2019s federal takeover of the city\\u2019s law enforcement, with local officials citing falling crime to resist his intervention.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing the probe to claim D.C. leaders lied about crime, even though there is zero evidence of fake data.

His actions came amid a DOJ probe into James over \\u201Cmortgage fraud.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Martin\\u2019s stunts show Trump has turned the DOJ into a weapon to intimidate his enemies.

She amplified election lies on-air even as she privately admitted Biden won fairly\\u2014and secured a Trump pardon for her ex-husband. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Pirro used her Fox platform to serve Trump\\u2019s interests and lie to the public, and she now holds one of the most powerful prosecutorial posts in the country.

The move zeroes in on California, where 81% of votes were cast by mail in 2024 and slow counts left House control undecided for weeks.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing California\\u2019s slow counts as part of his war on voting, setting up mail ballots as the next target alongside redistricting battles.

Officials lied that the cuts were based on performance.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The purge gutted a new IRS unit tasked with auditing the wealthy and complex partnerships, crippling tax enforcement.

Officials claim restroom and pronoun policies violate Title IX.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is weaponizing federal funds to enforce his war on trans rights, coercing schools into \\u201Cbiology-based\\u201D rules.
