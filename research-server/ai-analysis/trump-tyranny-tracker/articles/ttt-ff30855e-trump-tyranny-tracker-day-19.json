  "content": "A worker removes the U.S. Agency for International Development sign on their headquarters on February 07, 2025 in Washington, DC. Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 7Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsKash Patel Took Payment From Russian Filmmaker With Kremlin TiesWhat Happened: Kash Patel was paid $25,000 by Global Tree Pictures, a company owned by Igor Lopatonok, a filmmaker with direct Kremlin ties who has produced Russian propaganda. The payment was listed as an \u201chonorarium\u201d for Patel\u2019s participation in a Tucker Carlson-backed docuseries that pushed anti-Western conspiracy theories and depicted Trump allies as victims of a deep-state plot.Why It Matters: If confirmed, Patel would lead the agency responsible for countering Russian espionage, despite financial ties to a Kremlin-linked entity. His appointment signals a dangerous shift in U.S. intelligence, as Trump dismantles Russia sanctions enforcement and questions support for Ukraine.Source: Washington PostTrump's media company gave a roughly $800,000 stock award to his pick for FBI directorWhat Happened: Kash Patel received $800,000 in stock from Trump Media & Technology Group just days before his Senate confirmation hearing. Patel did not disclose the stock award in his financial disclosure report.Why It Matters: Patel\u2019s financial ties to Trump\u2019s media company compromise FBI independence, mirroring Russia, where Kremlin loyalists have influence or control over various agencies. His appointment reinforces Trump\u2019s intent to weaponize the FBI against political enemies.Source: Business InsiderTrump Air Force nominee arranged satellite contract in manner that favored Musk's SpaceXWhat Happened: Troy Meink, Trump\u2019s Air Force Secretary nominee, allegedly structured a multibillion-dollar NRO spy satellite contract to favor Musk\u2019s SpaceX. The 2021 deal, initially worth $1.8 billion, was tailored to SpaceX\u2019s capabilities, prompting complaints and an internal probe. Meink reportedly warned L3Harris against protesting the award.Why It Matters: This exposes more Trump-era corruption, with Fake DOGE allowing Musk and Trump\u2019s loyalists to consolidate power, erode oversight, and enrich allies while dismantling accountability. Trump is outsourcing national security decisions to an unelected billionaire and his inner circle.Source: ReutersTrump Considering Blagojevich for Ambassador to SerbiaWhat Happened: Trump is reportedly considering Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor convicted on 17 corruption charges, for U.S. ambassador to Serbia. Blagojevich, whose sentence was commuted by Trump in 2020, has been a vocal Trump supporter and recently met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107.Why It Matters: Appointing a convicted corrupt politician as the U.S. envoy to Serbia would be a blatant insult to democratic governance. It also raises ethics concerns, given Trump\u2019s business ties in Serbia, including a proposed Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade. This further highlights Trump's prioritization of loyalty over diplomatic credibility.Source: POLITICOThe Elite Lawyers Working for Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE Include Former Supreme Court ClerksWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s Fake DOGE has recruited conservative lawyers, including: James Burnham, former Trump White House lawyer and Gorsuch clerk, Keenan Kmiec, a former Chief Justice Roberts clerk, now with crypto ties, and Jacob Altik, a future Gorsuch clerk and former Neomi Rao clerk.Why It Matters: FAKE DOGE is stacking itself with Supreme Court clerks and Trump DOJ loyalists to shield its corruption and legalize its power grab. As lawsuits challenge its legal strategy erodes the separation of powers. A Supreme Court showdown looms over Musk\u2019s unchecked control and gutting of government agencies.Source: ProPublicaTrump Purges Inspectors General Investigating Musk\u2019s BusinessesWhat Happened: Trump fired over a dozen inspectors general, including at least five agencies that have investigated Elon Musk\u2019s companies, many of which hold billions in government contracts. The move follows Musk\u2019s $288 million in support for Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and his unprecedented power as head of the US government.Why It Matters: This mass purge eliminates key watchdogs overseeing Musk\u2019s businesses, removing oversight and accountability for potential fraud or abuse. With Musk already consolidating control over federal agencies, this move further shields him from scrutiny, solidifying fears of capture of government institutions.Source: The Lever\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTreasury Warned DOGE\u2019s Access to Payments Poses \u2018Insider Threat\u2019What Happened: A confidential Treasury assessment flagged fake DOGE\u2019s access to the U.S. government\u2019s $5 trillion payment system as an \u201cunprecedented insider threat risk.\u201d The warning, issued by federal contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, urged the Treasury to immediately suspend DOGE\u2019s access and investigate any changes made by Elon Musk\u2019s operatives. Despite this, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appointed Musk ally Tom Krause\u2014with no prior government experience\u2014to oversee the system. Why It Matters: The appointment of unvetted Musk operatives to control federal payments jeopardizes national security and risks exposing sensitive data of all Americans, U.S. spies, Pentagon contractors, and other sensitive recipients. Adversaries like Russia and China will exploit any vulnerabilities in the system.Source: Washington PostMusk Moves to Dismantle Consumer Protection BureauWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s operatives have infiltrated the CFPB, raising alarms over potential access to sensitive data. Musk posted \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on X, signaling plans to dismantle the agency.Why It Matters: The CFPB has recovered $20B for consumers and regulates financial institutions, including Musk\u2019s X payments system. Critics warn of conflicts of interest, while Republicans cheer the move as long overdue.Source: POLITICOMembers of Congress denied access to Department of EducationWhat Happened: Multiple Democratic lawmakers were denied entry to the Department of Education on Friday by Musk\u2019s operatives. The lawmakers were seeking an emergency meeting over reports Trump plans to shut down the agency. Armed federal officers were called to the scene.Why It Matters: Blocking elected officials from federal agencies signals increasing authoritarian control over government functions. Source: The HillMusk\u2019s DOGE Operatives Gain Access to Energy Department, Raising Security ConcernsWhat Happened: Three Musk operatives have started working inside the U.S. Energy Department, raising alarms about their access to personnel files, financial data, and federal grant disbursement records. One member, former SpaceX intern Luke Farritor, has been embedded in the department\u2019s IT office, appearing in internal email and messaging systems.Why It Matters: Despite claims that Musk\u2019s operatives lack security clearances, their access to sensitive government data raises serious risks of breaches and misuse. This underscores Musk\u2019s unchecked influence and the growing threat of corruption within federal agencies. With the regime repeatedly lying to push its agenda, official statements can no longer be trusted.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump\u2019s Top DC Prosecutor Launches Probe Based on Musk\u2019s ReferralWhat Happened: Ed Martin, Trump\u2019s top prosecutor in DC, publicly announced an investigation into government employees accused of theft and threats, based on a referral from Elon Musk. The probe's details remain unclear, but Martin vowed to pursue those deemed disloyal to the regime.Why It Matters: This politically motivated investigation weaponizes law enforcement to target civil servants, violating DOJ rules on impartiality. Martin, a Trump loyalist and Jan. 6 sympathizer, has openly advocated for insurrectionists. His public announcement of the probe signals a dangerous shift toward authoritarian lawfare\u2014where justice is wielded as a tool of political retribution.Source: ReutersTrump DOJ Agrees to Delay Public Disclosure of FBI Agents on Jan. 6 CasesWhat Happened: Trump reached a temporary agreement with the FBI Agents Association, \u2018promising\u2019 not to publicly release the names of FBI employees involved in Jan. 6 investigations without a two-day advance notice. The Justice Department originally demanded a full list of 5,000 personnel, raising fears of retaliation against career law enforcement officials.Why It Matters: This does little to protect FBI agents who investigated Trump\u2019s cronies and insurrectionists. His DOJ can still weaponize the list for purges, retaliation, or leaks to right-wing groups, putting agents at serious risk.Source: POLITICOAt Justice Dept., Trump\u2019s Former Criminal Defender Emerges as His EnforcerWhat Happened: Emil Bove, Trump\u2019s acting deputy attorney general, has become the regime\u2019s chief enforcer, overseeing forced transfers of career officials, firing prosecutors investigating Trump, and demanding names of FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. His power grab has sparked internal resistance, with FBI leadership refusing to fully comply and lawsuits piling up.Why It Matters: Bove\u2019s actions signal a direct assault on the DOJ\u2019s independence, using the Justice Department as a political weapon to purge those deemed disloyal. His targeting of Jan. 6 investigators raises fears of retaliation and intimidation, sending a chilling message to federal law enforcement. With Kash Patel expected to take over the FBI, Trump is consolidating absolute control over federal investigative powers, making institutional resistance nearly impossible.Source: NYTSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Appoints Himself Kennedy Center Chair, Citing Disapproval of Drag ShowsWhat Happened: Trump announced he will take over as chairman of the Kennedy Center, removing existing board members and installing a new leadership team. He criticized the center for hosting drag performances and vowed to reshape its programming.Why It Matters: This move politicizes a major cultural institution, signaling further government interference in the arts to push Trump\u2019s ideological agenda. By targeting LGBTQ+ performances, the regime is escalating its broader culture war. A tactic seen in Russia.Source: WSJTrump Megadonor Seeks to Overturn Press Freedom RulingWhat Happened: Steve Wynn, a Trump megadonor, has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan, the 1964 ruling that protects journalists from lawsuits when reporting on public officials.Why It Matters: This threatens press freedom, making it easier for powerful figures to silence journalists through lawsuits. It aligns with Trump\u2019s broader authoritarian crackdown on the media, mirroring tactics used in Russia and China to suppress investigative reporting and shield corruption.Source: David Enrich (NYT) on XPentagon Expels More News Outlets, Welcomes Right-Wing MediaWhat Happened: The Pentagon doubled the number of news organizations being forced out of their dedicated office spaces, including CNN, The Washington Post, The Hill, and The War Zone. This follows the eviction of The New York Times, NBC, Politico, and NPR. Incoming replacements include Breitbart, Newsmax, OANN, and The Daily Caller\u2014right wing outlets aligned with Trump. The Defense Department claims this is part of a \"media rotation program.\"Why It Matters: This is a clear purge of critical media voices, replacing them with pro-Trump outlets in a blatant attempt to reshape Pentagon coverage. By pushing out independent journalism and embedding partisan propaganda, the regime is eroding press freedom and further politicizing military reporting.Source: ReutersTrump Establishes White House Faith Office, Citing Christian PersecutionWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order creating a White House Faith Office under the Domestic Policy Council, led by Rev. Paula White, a longtime religious adviser. The office will coordinate with Attorney General Pam Bondi to combat \"anti-Christian bias\" and push for faith-based influence in policymaking.Why It Matters: This move mirrors authoritarian religious nationalism, using government power to favor Christianity, erode church-state separation, and embed religious influence in federal agencies. Similar to Putin\u2019s use of the Orthodox Church, it signals a broader effort to consolidate power under a faith-based political agenda.Source: The HillTrump Fires National Archivist What Happened: Trump abruptly dismissed Colleen Shogan, Archivist of the United States, late Friday. White House official Sergio Gor announced the firing on X, thanking Shogan for her service but offering no explanation. Shogan, appointed by President Biden in 2022, was caught off guard by the firing.Why It Matters: The National Archives played a key role in exposing Trump\u2019s mishandling of classified documents, making this an act of political retaliation. With control over presidential records, Trump\u2019s handpicked replacement could rewrite history, obstruct investigations, and shield his regime from future scrutiny.Source: CNNTrump Revokes Biden\u2019s Security Clearance in Retaliatory MoveWhat Happened: Trump announced he revoked Joe Biden\u2019s security clearance, citing Biden\u2019s alleged mental decline and claiming the access was only a \"courtesy\" for former presidents.Why It Matters: This move is a clear act of political retribution, further escalating Trump\u2019s weaponization of government institutions. It sets a dangerous precedent where national security decisions are dictated by personal grievances rather than strategic necessity.Source: WSJTrump Defies Court, Pushes Birthright Citizenship BanWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled Trump\u2019s order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional, issuing a nationwide block. The judge accused Trump of ignoring the rule of law.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s defiance of court rulings signals a dangerous erosion of judicial authority. His regime\u2019s push to override constitutional protections sets the stage for a legal and constitutional crisis, reinforcing his authoritarian grip.Source: Reuters\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Moves to Restart Family Detention for MigrantsWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to reinstate family detention centers, reversing Biden-era policies that allowed families to remain in the U.S. under monitoring programs. ICE is soliciting bids from private prison companies to reopen large-scale family detention facilities in Texas, with the potential for more centers to follow. Tens of thousands of families with final deportation orders could soon be fast-tracked for arrest and removal.Why It Matters: This mass detention plan risks separating mixed-status families, forcing legal U.S. residents to choose between staying or leaving with deported relatives. Civil rights groups warn it revives Trump\u2019s past human rights abuses, including the loss of young children in detention, leading to trauma, overcrowding, and legal violations.Source: NBC NewsTrump\u2019s Deportation Tactics Spark International Outrage Over Shackling of Indian MigrantsWhat Happened: Over 100 Indian migrants deported from the U.S. were shackled for the entire 40-hour flight, including during bathroom breaks, fueling outrage in India. Protests erupted in New Delhi, with lawmakers condemning Trump\u2019s crackdown and mocking his friendship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Why It Matters: The treatment of deportees has escalated diplomatic tensions just days before Modi\u2019s scheduled visit to the White House. Indian officials and deportees are demanding accountability, questioning the harsh measures and their implications for U.S.-India relations.Source: CNNTrump Slashes University Research Funds, Threatening Medical BreakthroughsWhat Happened: Trump announced a new NIH policy capping indirect research funds at 15%, down from 50-60% at some institutions. This will gut $9 billion in support for lab facilities, equipment, and staff at top universities, including Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins. The policy, set to take effect Monday, aligns with Project 2025 goals to defund institutions seen as promoting \u201cwoke\u201d policies.Why It Matters: This drastic cut threatens biomedical research, stalling clinical trials, halting life-saving treatments, and crippling efforts to combat cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, and infectious diseases. Universities, already budgeting for these funds, face devastating shortfalls that could result in mass layoffs, lab closures, and an exodus of top scientists.Source: NYTUSAID Humanitarian Work Halted as Trump Guts AgencyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s takeover of USAID has effectively stopped all humanitarian aid, despite claims of waivers for lifesaving programs. Elon Musk has seized control, furloughing staff and blocking funds, leaving aid organizations unable to continue operations. Why It Matters: This deliberate sabotage of U.S. foreign aid has left millions without emergency food, medicine, and shelter, causing mass layoffs and forcing American families stationed abroad into crisis. With no staff left to process funding requests, aid partners are collapsing, and USAID families face homelessness upon returning to the U.S. Trump and Musk\u2019s move to dismantle USAID is not just a political power play\u2014it is a global humanitarian disaster that benefits Russia and China and weakens U.S. influence worldwide.Source: ABC NewsMore GOP-led states seek to follow Trump\u2019s lead in defining male and femaleWhat Happened: Alabama and multiple GOP-led states are moving to legally define male and female based solely on reproductive anatomy at birth, following Trump\u2019s executive order rejecting gender transition. At least nine states have already enacted similar laws, and more bills are advancing in Nebraska, Wyoming, Arizona, Indiana, Missouri, and South Carolina.Why It Matters: This coordinated push seeks to erase legal recognition of transgender individuals, restricting access to ID changes, bathrooms, healthcare, and legal protections. By weaponizing state laws against trans rights, these measures escalate discrimination, put marginalized communities at greater risk of violence, and solidify an extreme federal-state crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights.Source: AP\ud83d\udcf0 In Other Alarming NewsDOGE operative fired from cybersecurity internship for leaking company informationWhat Happened: A 19-year-old Musk operative, Edward Coristine, was previously fired from a cybersecurity internship for leaking company information, raising serious concerns about his access to federal systems. Coristine later bragged in online chats that he retained access to company servers and could have wiped them if he wanted.Why It Matters: These unvetted, extremist operatives now have access to sensitive government data, including classified materials, personnel records, data of all Americans, and federal payments. Source: The Independent Trump Calls for Rehiring DOGE Staffer Who Resigned Over Racist PostsWhat Happened: Marko Elez, a DOGE operative embedded at the Treasury Department, resigned after reports linked him to a deleted social media account advocating racism and eugenics. Despite the controversy, Trump, JD Vance, and Elon Musk are reinstated him.Why It Matters: The reinstatement an unvetted official with extremist views shows how Trump and Musk are remaking the government with ideological loyalists. Elez\u2019s access to sensitive financial systems highlights the dangerous lack of oversight as Musk consolidates control.Source: WSJ \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge Temporarily Blocks Trump\u2019s USAID PurgeWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump\u2019s plan to place 2,200 USAID workers on leave, dealing a setback to his regime\u2019s push to gut the foreign aid agency. The lawsuit, filed by government employee groups, argues that the regime is illegally dismantling USAID without congressional approval.Source: Washington Post19 States Sue to Block Musk\u2019s DOGE from Accessing Americans\u2019 Personal DataWhat Happened: Nineteen Democratic attorneys general sued the Trump regime, arguing that Elon Musk\u2019s FAKE DOGE unlawfully accessed sensitive Treasury Department records, including Social Security numbers and bank account details. The lawsuit, filed in federal court, claims DOGE\u2019s access violates federal law and threatens the privacy and security of millions of Americans.Source: APThis public resource monitors legal challenges against Trump.

Trump/Musk/Heritage Foundation administration is doing.</span></p><p><span>I am suspicious that Elon Musk is in the treasury disemboweling USAID, medicare, medicaid, social security, the dept of Education right now as a scare tactic to pressure the Democrats to raise the debt ceiling because all of the fuddling around and cutting that he does, is not going to get them the kind of tax breaks that he wants himself and his fellow non-tax paying billionaires to have.</span></p><p><span>At least one Republican is speaking up. Good for Angus King of Maine. </span></p><p><span><a class=\"linkified\" href=\"https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-to-senate-colleagues-now-is-the-time-to-establish-a-redlinethe-constitution-itself\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.king.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/king-to-senate-colleagues-now-is-the-time-to-establish-a-redlinethe-constitution-itself</a></span></p><p><span>His words are spot on. With more calls perhaps more Republicans will speak up too. It is a measure of their intelligence if they do.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div

The payment was listed as an \\u201Chonorarium\\u201D for Patel\\u2019s participation in a Tucker Carlson-backed docuseries that pushed anti-Western conspiracy theories and depicted Trump allies as victims of a deep-state plot.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If confirmed, Patel would lead the agency responsible for countering Russian espionage, despite financial ties to a Kremlin-linked entity. His appointment signals a dangerous shift in U.S. intelligence, as Trump dismantles Russia sanctions enforcement and questions support for Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/patel-fbi-russia-lopatonok/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump's media company gave a roughly $800,000 stock award to his pick for FBI director</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Kash Patel received $800,000 in stock from Trump Media &amp; Technology Group just days before his Senate confirmation hearing. Patel did not disclose the stock award in his financial disclosure report.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Patel\\u2019s financial ties to Trump\\u2019s media company compromise FBI independence, mirroring Russia, where Kremlin loyalists have influence or control over various agencies. His appointment reinforces Trump\\u2019s intent to weaponize the FBI against political enemies.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-fbi-pick-share-award-trump-media-group-2025-2\\\\\\\">Business Insider</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Air Force nominee arranged satellite contract in manner that favored Musk's SpaceX</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Troy Meink, Trump\\u2019s Air Force Secretary nominee, allegedly structured a multibillion-dollar NRO spy satellite contract to favor Musk\\u2019s SpaceX. The 2021 deal, initially worth $1.8 billion, was tailored to SpaceX\\u2019s capabilities, prompting complaints and an internal probe. Meink reportedly warned L3Harris against protesting the award.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This exposes more Trump-era corruption, with Fake DOGE allowing Musk and Trump\\u2019s loyalists to consolidate power, erode oversight, and enrich allies while dismantling accountability. Trump is outsourcing national security decisions to an unelected billionaire and his inner circle.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-air-force-nominee-arranged-satellite-contract-manner-that-favored-musks-2025-02-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Considering Blagojevich for Ambassador to Serbia</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump is reportedly considering Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor convicted on 17 corruption charges, for U.S. ambassador to Serbia. Blagojevich, whose sentence was commuted by Trump in 2020, has been a vocal Trump supporter and recently met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\\u010Di\\u0107.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Appointing a convicted corrupt politician as the U.S. envoy to Serbia would be a blatant insult to democratic governance. It also raises ethics concerns, given Trump\\u2019s business ties in Serbia, including a proposed Trump-branded hotel in Belgrade. This further highlights Trump's prioritization of loyalty over diplomatic credibility.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/trump-blagojevich-ambassador-serbia-00203103\\\\\\\">POLITICO</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>The Elite Lawyers Working for Elon Musk\\u2019s DOGE Include Former Supreme Court Clerks</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk\\u2019s Fake DOGE has recruited conservative lawyers, including: James Burnham, former Trump White House lawyer and Gorsuch clerk, Keenan Kmiec, a former Chief Justice Roberts clerk, now with crypto ties, and Jacob Altik, a future Gorsuch clerk and former Neomi Rao clerk.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> FAKE DOGE is stacking itself with Supreme Court clerks and Trump DOJ loyalists to shield its corruption and legalize its power grab. As lawsuits challenge its legal strategy erodes the separation of powers.

The move follows Musk\\u2019s $288 million in support for Trump\\u2019s 2024 campaign and his unprecedented power as head of the US government.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This mass purge eliminates key watchdogs overseeing Musk\\u2019s businesses, removing oversight and accountability for potential fraud or abuse. With Musk already consolidating control over federal agencies, this move further shields him from scrutiny, solidifying fears of capture of government institutions.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.levernews.com/trump-purges-inspectors-general-investigating-musks-businesses/\\\\\\\">The Lever</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Treasury Warned DOGE\\u2019s Access to Payments Poses \\u2018Insider Threat\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A confidential Treasury assessment flagged fake DOGE\\u2019s access to the U.S. government\\u2019s $5 trillion payment system as an \\u201Cunprecedented insider threat risk.\\u201D The warning, issued by federal contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, urged the Treasury to immediately suspend DOGE\\u2019s access and investigate any changes made by Elon Musk\\u2019s operatives. Despite this, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appointed Musk ally Tom Krause\\u2014with no prior government experience\\u2014to oversee the system. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The appointment of unvetted Musk operatives to control federal payments jeopardizes national security and risks exposing sensitive data of all Americans, U.S. spies, Pentagon contractors, and other sensitive recipients. Adversaries like Russia and China will exploit any vulnerabilities in the system.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/doge-treasury-payments-system-warning/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Moves to Dismantle Consumer Protection Bureau</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk\\u2019s operatives have infiltrated the CFPB, raising alarms over potential access to sensitive data. Musk posted \\u201CCFPB RIP\\u201D on X, signaling plans to dismantle the agency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The CFPB has recovered $20B for consumers and regulates financial institutions, including Musk\\u2019s X payments system. Critics warn of conflicts of interest, while Republicans cheer the move as long overdue.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/elon-musk-team-cfpb-00203119\\\\\\\">POLITICO</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Members of Congress denied access to Department of Education</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Multiple Democratic lawmakers were denied entry to the Department of Education on Friday by Musk\\u2019s operatives. The lawmakers were seeking an emergency meeting over reports Trump plans to shut down the agency. Armed federal officers were called to the scene.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Blocking elected officials from federal agencies signals increasing authoritarian control over government functions. </p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5132685-department-of-education-musk-doge-trump-frost/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s DOGE Operatives Gain Access to Energy Department, Raising Security Concerns</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Three Musk operatives have started working inside the U.S. Energy Department, raising alarms about their access to personnel files, financial data, and federal grant disbursement records. One member, former SpaceX intern Luke Farritor, has been embedded in the department\\u2019s IT office, appearing in internal email and messaging systems.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Despite claims that Musk\\u2019s operatives lack security clearances, their access to sensitive government data raises serious risks of breaches and misuse. This underscores Musk\\u2019s unchecked influence and the growing threat of corruption within federal agencies. With the regime repeatedly lying to push its agenda, official statements can no longer be trusted.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-doge-members-raise-access-concerns-us-energy-department-sources-say-2025-02-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Top DC Prosecutor Launches Probe Based on Musk\\u2019s Referral</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Ed Martin, Trump\\u2019s top prosecutor in DC, publicly announced an investigation into government employees accused of theft and threats, based on a referral from Elon Musk. The probe's details remain unclear, but Martin vowed to pursue those deemed disloyal to the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This politically motivated investigation weaponizes law enforcement to target civil servants, violating DOJ rules on impartiality. Martin, a Trump loyalist and Jan. 6 sympathizer, has openly advocated for insurrectionists. His public announcement of the probe signals a dangerous shift toward authoritarian lawfare\\u2014where justice is wielded as a tool of political retribution.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-trump-prosecutor-dc-opens-probe-based-referral-elon-musk-2025-02-07/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump DOJ Agrees to Delay Public Disclosure of FBI Agents on Jan. 6 Cases</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump reached a temporary agreement with the FBI Agents Association, \\u2018promising\\u2019 not to publicly release the names of FBI employees involved in Jan. 6 investigations without a two-day advance notice. The Justice Department originally demanded a full list of 5,000 personnel, raising fears of retaliation against career law enforcement officials.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This does little to protect FBI agents who investigated Trump\\u2019s cronies and insurrectionists. His DOJ can still weaponize the list for purges, retaliation, or leaks to right-wing groups, putting agents at serious risk.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/trump-administration-fbi-agents-jan-6-014223\\\\\\\">POLITICO</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>At Justice Dept., Trump\\u2019s Former Criminal Defender Emerges as His Enforcer</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Emil Bove, Trump\\u2019s acting deputy attorney general, has become the regime\\u2019s chief enforcer, overseeing forced transfers of career officials, firing prosecutors investigating Trump, and demanding names of FBI agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. His power grab has sparked internal resistance, with FBI leadership refusing to fully comply and lawsuits piling up.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Bove\\u2019s actions signal a direct assault on the DOJ\\u2019s independence, using the Justice Department as a political weapon to purge those deemed disloyal. His targeting of Jan. 6 investigators raises fears of retaliation and intimidation, sending a chilling message to federal law enforcement. With Kash Patel expected to take over the FBI, Trump is consolidating absolute control over federal investigative powers, making institutional resistance nearly impossible.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/emil-bove-justice-fbi-trump-bondi.html\\\\\\\">NYT</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Appoints Himself Kennedy Center Chair, Citing Disapproval of Drag Shows</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced he will take over as chairman of the Kennedy Center, removing existing board members and installing a new leadership team. He criticized the center for hosting drag performances and vowed to reshape its programming.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move politicizes a major cultural institution, signaling further government interference in the arts to push Trump\\u2019s ideological agenda.

Sullivan, the 1964 ruling that protects journalists from lawsuits when reporting on public officials.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This threatens press freedom, making it easier for powerful figures to silence journalists through lawsuits. It aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader authoritarian crackdown on the media, mirroring tactics used in Russia and China to suppress investigative reporting and shield corruption.</p><p>Source: <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://x.com/davidenrich\\\\\\\">David Enrich</a> (NYT) on X</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Pentagon Expels More News Outlets, Welcomes Right-Wing Media</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Pentagon doubled the number of news organizations being forced out of their dedicated office spaces, including CNN, The Washington Post, The Hill, and The War Zone.

The Defense Department claims this is part of a \\\\\\\"media rotation program.\\\\\\\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a clear purge of critical media voices, replacing them with pro-Trump outlets in a blatant attempt to reshape Pentagon coverage. By pushing out independent journalism and embedding partisan propaganda, the regime is eroding press freedom and further politicizing military reporting.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-doubles-number-news-outlets-rotate-out-office-spaces-2025-02-08/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Establishes White House Faith Office, Citing Christian Persecution</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order creating a White House Faith Office under the Domestic Policy Council, led by Rev. Paula White, a longtime religious adviser. The office will coordinate with Attorney General Pam Bondi to combat \\\\\\\"anti-Christian bias\\\\\\\" and push for faith-based influence in policymaking.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move mirrors authoritarian religious nationalism, using government power to favor Christianity, erode church-state separation, and embed religious influence in federal agencies. Similar to Putin\\u2019s use of the Orthodox Church, it signals a broader effort to consolidate power under a faith-based political agenda.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5133838-trump-order-white-house-faith-office/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires National Archivist </strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump abruptly dismissed Colleen Shogan, Archivist of the United States, late Friday. White House official Sergio Gor announced the firing on X, thanking Shogan for her service but offering no explanation. Shogan, appointed by President Biden in 2022, was caught off guard by the firing.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The National Archives played a key role in exposing Trump\\u2019s mishandling of classified documents, making this an act of political retaliation. With control over presidential records, Trump\\u2019s handpicked replacement could rewrite history, obstruct investigations, and shield his regime from future scrutiny.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/politics/colleen-shogan-trump-dismisses-national-archivist/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Revokes Biden\\u2019s Security Clearance in Retaliatory Move</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced he revoked Joe Biden\\u2019s security clearance, citing Biden\\u2019s alleged mental decline and claiming the access was only a \\\\\\\"courtesy\\\\\\\" for former presidents.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move is a clear act of political retribution, further escalating Trump\\u2019s weaponization of government institutions. It sets a dangerous precedent where national security decisions are dictated by personal grievances rather than strategic necessity.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-he-revoked-joe-bidens-security-clearance-6043e6d3?mod=hp_lead_pos4\\\\\\\">WSJ</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Defies Court, Pushes Birthright Citizenship Ban</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>A federal judge ruled Trump\\u2019s order ending birthright citizenship unconstitutional, issuing a nationwide block. The judge accused Trump of ignoring the rule of law.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s defiance of court rulings signals a dangerous erosion of judicial authority. His regime\\u2019s push to override constitutional protections sets the stage for a legal and constitutional crisis, reinforcing his authoritarian grip.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-accuses-trump-ignoring-rule-law-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-02-06/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Moves to Restart Family Detention for Migrants</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is preparing to reinstate family detention centers, reversing Biden-era policies that allowed families to remain in the U.S. under monitoring programs. ICE is soliciting bids from private prison companies to reopen large-scale family detention facilities in Texas, with the potential for more centers to follow. Tens of thousands of families with final deportation orders could soon be fast-tracked for arrest and removal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This mass detention plan risks separating mixed-status families, forcing legal U.S. residents to choose between staying or leaving with deported relatives. Civil rights groups warn it revives Trump\\u2019s past human rights abuses, including the loss of young children in detention, leading to trauma, overcrowding, and legal violations.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-preparing-restart-immigrant-family-detention-rcna191230\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Deportation Tactics Spark International Outrage Over Shackling of Indian Migrants</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Over 100 Indian migrants deported from the U.S. were shackled for the entire 40-hour flight, including during bathroom breaks, fueling outrage in India. Protests erupted in New Delhi, with lawmakers condemning Trump\\u2019s crackdown and mocking his friendship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The treatment of deportees has escalated diplomatic tensions just days before Modi\\u2019s scheduled visit to the White House. Indian officials and deportees are demanding accountability, questioning the harsh measures and their implications for U.S.-India relations.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/india/india-trump-shackles-deportations-intl-hnk/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Slashes University Research Funds, Threatening Medical Breakthroughs</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump announced a new NIH policy capping indirect research funds at 15%, down from 50-60% at some institutions. This will gut $9 billion in support for lab facilities, equipment, and staff at top universities, including Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins. The policy, set to take effect Monday, aligns with Project 2025 goals to defund institutions seen as promoting \\u201Cwoke\\u201D policies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This drastic cut threatens biomedical research, stalling clinical trials, halting life-saving treatments, and crippling efforts to combat cancer, Alzheimer\\u2019s, and infectious diseases. Universities, already budgeting for these funds, face devastating shortfalls that could result in mass layoffs, lab closures, and an exodus of top scientists.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/medical-research-funding-cuts-university-budgets.html\\\\\\\">NYT</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>USAID Humanitarian Work Halted as Trump Guts Agency</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump\\u2019s takeover of USAID has effectively stopped all humanitarian aid, despite claims of waivers for lifesaving programs. Elon Musk has seized control, furloughing staff and blocking funds, leaving aid organizations unable to continue operations. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This deliberate sabotage of U.S. foreign aid has left millions without emergency food, medicine, and shelter, causing mass layoffs and forcing American families stationed abroad into crisis. With no staff left to process funding requests, aid partners are collapsing, and USAID families face homelessness upon returning to the U.S. Trump and Musk\\u2019s move to dismantle USAID is not just a political power play\\u2014it is a global humanitarian disaster that benefits Russia and China and weakens U.S. influence worldwide.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/usaid-humanitarian-work-effectively-stopped-current-former-officials/story?id=118578076\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>More GOP-led states seek to follow Trump\\u2019s lead in defining male and female</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Alabama and multiple GOP-led states are moving to legally define male and female based solely on reproductive anatomy at birth, following Trump\\u2019s executive order rejecting gender transition. At least nine states have already enacted similar laws, and more bills are advancing in Nebraska, Wyoming, Arizona, Indiana, Missouri, and South Carolina.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This coordinated push seeks to erase legal recognition of transgender individuals, restricting access to ID changes, bathrooms, healthcare, and legal protections. By weaponizing state laws against trans rights, these measures escalate discrimination, put marginalized communities at greater risk of violence, and solidify an extreme federal-state crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-trump-defining-sex-1551c306c460b0c942f33b0d83178bad\\\\\\\">AP</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCF0 In Other Alarming News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>DOGE operative fired from cybersecurity internship for leaking company information</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>A 19-year-old Musk operative, Edward Coristine, was previously fired from a cybersecurity internship for leaking company information, raising serious concerns about his access to federal systems.
