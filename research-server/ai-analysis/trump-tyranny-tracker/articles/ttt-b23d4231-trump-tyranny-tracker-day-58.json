Jose Luis Magana / AP fileShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 18Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsDonald Trump Held Another Million-Dollar \u2018Candlelight\u2019 Dinner\u2014With Elon Musk in TowWhat Happened: Trump held another off-the-books $1 million-per-seat fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, attended by Elon Musk and top MAGA donors. The event, unlike a previous similar dinner, was not listed on Trump\u2019s public schedule. Meanwhile, as Trump and Musk dined, his regime defied a federal court order by deporting alleged Venezuelan \u201cgang members.\u201dWhy It Matters: These secretive pay-for-play fundraisers highlight major corruption, allowing billionaires and business elites to buy direct access to Trump. Musk\u2019s presence is especially notable given his control over the federal government. Source: WIREDFTC Removes Posts Critical of Amazon, Microsoft, and AI CompaniesWhat Happened: The Federal Trade Commission removed over 300 business guidance blogs from the Biden era, including posts on AI risks, privacy lawsuits against Amazon and Microsoft, and consumer protection compliance. The deleted posts included critical insights on how companies should handle AI, children\u2019s data, and surveillance technology.Why It Matters: This purge benefits Big Tech by erasing accountability measures and compliance guidelines, making it easier for companies to exploit consumer data without oversight. This aligns with Trump\u2019s broader push to dismantle regulatory safeguards.Source: WIREDRussia Seeks Mars Talks With Musk Amid His Expanding Political RoleWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s envoy for international cooperation, Kirill Dmitriev, again announced plans to discuss Mars exploration with Musk. Moscow wants to expand space collaboration with the U.S. despite its ongoing genocidal war. Musk has previously secretly communicated with Putin and played a key role in limiting Ukraine\u2019s access to Starlink during the war.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unchecked influence in global politics continues to grow, blurring the line between private industry, U.S. government policy, and Russian interests. Meanwhile, his direct involvement in U.S. federal agencies raises serious concerns over accountability and national security.Source: The GuardianNasa cuts raise fears of handing more influence to SpaceX owner MuskWhat Happened: Trump is shutting down NASA\u2019s Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy and the Office of the Chief Scientist, cutting independent oversight of moon and Mars missions.Why It Matters: Critics warn this hands more power to Musk, whose SpaceX is NASA\u2019s biggest contractor. With Musk advising Trump and a SpaceX investor nominated as NASA chief, the move highlights conflicts of interest and government favoritism.Source: The GuardianMusk\u2019s Starlink Installed at White HouseWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s Starlink internet service has been installed at the White House, reportedly as a \u201cdonation\u201d to improve connectivity. A security alarm was triggered when a Musk employee accessed the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u2019s roof without prior coordination.Why It Matters: Musk faces growing conflict-of-interest, especially as he continues to expand his federal contracts. Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are demanding an investigation into potential criminal corruption as Musk consolidates unprecedented power.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation News\u2018It\u2019s a Heist\u2019: Real Federal Auditors Are Horrified by DOGEWhat Happened: Federal auditors say Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE is not conducting real audits but recklessly accessing sensitive government data. Musk\u2019s operatives have ignored proper auditing procedures, falsely labeled errors as fraud, and rushed through federal systems without understanding them\u2014sparking fears surveillance and misuse of government contracts.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s actions are a blatant data grab, not a legitimate audit, with Musk using his unchecked power to dismantle federal agencies and target political opponents. The reckless misinterpretation of financial data is already leading to dangerous conspiracies, while the rushed access to personal records is a dangerous  data breach putting all Americans at risk.Source: WIREDLawsuit over deportation flights argues Trump's use of war authority could be limitlessWhat Happened: A lawsuit challenges Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members without due process. Plaintiffs argue that if left unchecked, Trump could designate any group as \"enemy aliens\" and deport them arbitrarily. A federal judge blocked some deportations, but the regime defied his order by allowing flights to continue over international waters.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s use of wartime powers to bypass immigration laws sets a dangerous precedent, allowing mass deportations without judicial oversight. His defiance of court rulings highlights an authoritarian disregard for legal limits, turning immigration enforcement into unchecked executive power. Today, it\u2019s immigration\u2014tomorrow, it\u2019s us.Source: CBS NewsHow Trump is picking \u2018battle-tested\u2019 new judgesWhat Happened: Trump is preparing a new wave of conservative judicial nominees, prioritizing ideological alignment and loyalty over traditional legal experience. With a Republican-controlled Senate, confirmations are expected to move quickly, further solidifying Trump's grip on the judiciary.Why It Matters: Trump wants to reshape the courts to erase the last checks on his power, ensuring a judiciary that will rubber-stamp his policies and shield him from legal challenges. With potential Supreme Court vacancies on the horizon, this is a power grab that threatens judicial independence and the rule of law.Source: PoliticoTrump Fires Democratic FTC Commissioners, Defying Supreme Court PrecedentWhat Happened: Trump fired Democratic Federal Trade Commission members Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, breaking long-standing precedent protecting independent regulators. Both commissioners plan to challenge their dismissal in court.Why It Matters: This cements Trump\u2019s push to bring independent regulatory agencies under his direct control, giving him unchecked power over consumer protection and antitrust enforcement. Source: The New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsRepublican Files Impeachment Against Judge Who Blocked Trump\u2019s DeportationsWhat Happened: Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) introduced articles of impeachment against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ruled against Trump\u2019s mass deportations of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. Trump again called for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment, despite Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 warning that impeachment should not be used to punish judicial rulings.Why It Matters: This is authoritarian theater\u2014it won\u2019t succeed, but it demonstrates the Republican Party\u2019s cult-like loyalty to Trump. Attempting to impeach a judge for ruling against the president is a dangerous attack on judicial independence.Source: The HillDOJ refuses to answer some questions from the judge who blocked Alien Enemies Act deportationsWhat Happened: The Justice Department refused to fully comply with U.S. District Judge James Boasberg\u2019s demand for details on deportations carried out under Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The DOJ argued that providing the requested information would compromise national security and foreign relations. In response, Boasberg ordered the government to submit answers in a sealed filing by noon Wednesday.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s defiance of judicial authority and defying court orders is a Constitutional crisis. The deportation flights continued despite Boasberg\u2019s restraining order, highlighting Trump\u2019s regime is operating above the law.Source: NBC NewsTrump Moves to Dismantle Inter-American Foundation, DOJ Backs TakeoverWhat Happened: The Inter-American Foundation sued Trump after the DOJ defended Trump\u2019s unilateral removal of its leadership. Trump-appointed official Peter Marocco declared himself IAF\u2019s leader, fired staff, cut grants, and attempted to recall already-disbursed funds\u2014effectively gutting the agency.Why It Matters: This is yet another Congress-created agency falling under Trump\u2019s direct control, showing that Congress is no longer a check on executive power. The dismantling of IAF threatens U.S. efforts to combat poverty, migration, and instability in Latin America, while handing control to political loyalists. Other agencies, including the U.S. African Development Foundation, are also suing to block similar takeovers.Source: The HillTrump Strips Hunter and Ashley Biden of Secret Service ProtectionWhat Happened: Trump announced the immediate revocation of Secret Service protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden, calling their security details \"ridiculous.\" The Secret Service confirmed it was working to comply. Why It Matters: This is an unprecedented move targeting the family of a political opponent. Trump ensured his adult children had extended protection after leaving office, making this a clear act of political retribution.Source: CBS NewsTrump Threatens to Cut NYC Transit Funds Over Subway CrimeWhat Happened: U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority that the federal government may withhold transit funding unless it addresses crime, fare evasion, and safety issues on the subway. The MTA must submit a security plan by March 31. The move comes the same day the MTA refused to halt congestion pricing, a policy Trump opposes.Why It Matters: This is political retaliation disguised as a safety measure. Trump is using federal funds as leverage to pressure Democratic-led New York while targeting policies it doesn\u2019t like. The MTA insists crime is down and fare evasion is being addressed, making this a power play.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsDenver Mayor Condemns Arrest of Immigration Advocate as \u2018Putin-Style Political Persecution\u2019What Happened: ICE arrested Jeanette Vizguerra, a well-known immigration advocate and mother of U.S. citizens, outside her workplace in Aurora, Colorado. Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. for over 30 years, previously took refuge in churches during Trump\u2019s first term when religious spaces were off-limits for ICE arrests\u2014a policy Trump has now revoked.Why It Matters: Denver Mayor Mike Johnston denounced the arrest as a Soviet-style crackdown on political dissidents, calling it retaliation for Vizguerra\u2019s activism against ICE. This highlights Trump\u2019s use of immigration enforcement as a political weapon, escalating fears of targeted persecution.Source: NBC NewsTrump Calls for Impeachment of Judge Blocking Deportations as Legal Challenges MountWhat Happened: Trump called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after the judge temporarily blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Trump accused Boasberg of being a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and an \"agitator,\" escalating his ongoing attacks on the judiciary. In response, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement, reaffirming that impeachment is not a response to judicial decisions and that the appellate process exists for such disputes.Why It Matters: Trump's defiance of court orders, including ignoring Boasberg's ruling to halt deportations, represents a dangerous authoritarian turn. His regime faces at least 127 lawsuits challenging its sweeping power grabs, including mass deportations, purges of federal employees, and attempts to strip birthright citizenship. Source: NPRDOGE Breaks Into the U.S. Institute of PeaceWhat Happened: Trump officials, backed by law enforcement, forcibly took over the U.S. Institute of Peace, a congressionally funded think tank. Staff were ejected, and Trump replaced its leadership, despite having no legal authority to do so.Why It Matters: This is a blatant, illegal power grab. USIP is an independent institution funded by Congress\u2014not a federal agency under Trump's control. Using law enforcement to break into and seize an organization like this is straight out of Russia\u2019s playbook. Source: NPRThe person the White House says is leading DOGE has also been working at HHSWhat Happened: Trump admitted that Amy Gleason, the supposed \u201chead\u201d of the unauthorized DOGE, has been simultaneously working at the Department of Health and Human Services since February. A court-ordered document release revealed her dual role after Trump tried to keep it under seal. Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2014widely seen as calling the shots\u2014has been described as only a \"senior advisor.\"Why It Matters: This deliberate obfuscation of unauthorized DOGE's chain of command is a classic authoritarian tactic\u2014hiding who actually wields power while shielding Musk from legal accountability. Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsU.S. Citizens Caught in Trump\u2019s Immigration RaidsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass deportation push is ensnaring U.S. citizens in immigration raids. Cases include a Philadelphia man wrongfully detained at his workplace, a 10-year-old Texan girl deported while seeking medical care, and Native Americans questioned for their legal status. Immigration agencies refuse to disclose how many citizens have been mistakenly detained.Why It Matters: Under Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration crackdown, American citizens are being unlawfully detained and even deported. Advocates warn that his quota-driven enforcement system will lead to more wrongful arrests, violating basic civil liberties.Source: ProPublicaICE Admits \u2018Many\u2019 Alleged \u201cGang Members\u201d Deported Under Trump Had No U.S. Criminal RecordWhat Happened: ICE acknowledged in a sworn filing that many individuals deported under the Alien Enemies Act had no criminal records in the U.S. The agency defended the deportations, arguing that a lack of charges didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t \u201cdangerous.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation policy is targeting people based on assumptions rather than proven criminal activity. Deporting individuals as potential \u201cterrorists\u201d without evidence raises major due process concerns.Source: ABC NewsTrump Removes Ban on \u2018Segregated Facilities\u2019 in Federal ContractsWhat Happened: Trump revoked a decades-old ban on segregated facilities\u2014such as waiting rooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains\u2014within federal contracts, according to a memo from the General Services Administration. The move follows Trump\u2019s executive order rolling back civil rights protections, including equal employment policies from 1965.Why It Matters: This is a sickening rollback of civil rights, reversing fundamental anti-discrimination protections in government contracting. It signals a return to legal segregationist policies, directly undermining decades of progress in workplace equality and racial justice.Source: ReutersFamilies of Deported Venezuelans Devastated as Loved Ones Sent to El Salvador\u2019s Notorious PrisonWhat Happened: Trump deported hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the rarely used 1798 Alien Enemies Act, claiming they were linked to the Tren de Aragua gang. Their families, who recognized them in a social media propaganda video from an El Salvador prison, say they were falsely accused based on tattoos and had no criminal records. Many had pending asylum cases in the U.S.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s mass deportation sweep is tearing families apart and sending people to a brutal prison notorious for human rights violations\u2014without due process. His use of wartime and various \u201cemergency\u201d powers to override immigration law sets a dangerous precedent, allowing the targeting of noncitizens without legal recourse. Today, it\u2019s immigrants\u2014tomorrow, it could be anyone.Source: NBC NewsAir Force purges photos, websites on pioneering female pilotsWhat Happened: Trump removed multiple Air Force webpages highlighting pioneering female pilots, including WWII-era Women\u2019s Airforce Service Pilots and Maj. Gen. Jeannie Leavitt, the Air Force\u2019s first female fighter pilot. The deletions are part of Trump\u2019s executive order eliminating \u201cdiversity-related\u201d content across government agencies. Some URLs were even modified with \u201cdei\u201d to mark them for removal.Why It Matters: This is a deliberate effort to erase women's contributions to military history, echoing authoritarian regimes that rewrite history to fit their agenda. By purging these recognitions, Trump is sending a clear message: honoring the achievements of women\u2014and other marginalized groups\u2014is now considered \"divisive.\u201dSource: Air Force TimesTrump Cuts Cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s Research at Columbia UniversityWhat Happened: Trump terminated a $5 million grant to Columbia\u2019s Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, along with 400+ NIH grants totaling over $250 million. These cuts are part of a broader effort to punish Columbia University.Why It Matters: The cuts impact research on cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, HIV, maternal health, and cardiovascular disease, as well as funding for student training in neuroscience and autoimmune diseases. Source: NOTUSTrump Weighs Cutting HIV-Prevention Funds, Dismantling Key Public Health EffortWhat Happened: Trump is considering slashing CDC funding for domestic HIV prevention programs, which provide testing, surveillance, and outreach efforts across the U.S. Why It Matters: These cuts would devastate state and local HIV prevention efforts, gutting essential public health programs under the pretense of fiscal conservatism. This is yet another step in dismantling the federal government\u2019s role in safeguarding public health.Source: PoliticoTexas AG Arrests Multiple People Over Alleged Illegal Abortions in Sweeping CrackdownWhat Happened: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the arrests of three individuals accused of illegally providing abortions in the state, where nearly all abortions are banned. This follows Paxton\u2019s lawsuit against a New York doctor who provided abortion pills to a Texas woman.Why It Matters: This marks a major escalation in Texas' abortion crackdown, setting a precedent for aggressive enforcement of post-Roe laws. With severe penalties of up to 20 years in prison, it underscores control over reproductive rights and raises questions about cross-state legal battles over abortion access.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchPentagon Plans to Cut Up to 60,000 Jobs What Happened: The Pentagon aims to cut between 50,000 and 60,000 civilian employees, primarily through voluntary resignations. So far, 21,000 resignations have been approved under the Deferred Resignation Program. Hiring freezes and dismissals of probationary employees are also part of the reduction strategy.Why It Matters: The cuts would impact civilian support roles critical to defense operations. Source: ABC NewsNew Social Security \u201cAnti-Fraud\u201d Rule Forces More In-Person VisitsWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration will require in-person identity verification for applicants who can't prove their identity online. Additionally, beneficiaries can no longer change their bank account information over the phone. These measures, taking effect March 29-31, will significantly increase office visits and delays.Why It Matters: This exposes Trump\u2019s lies about protecting Social Security while creating massive delays for millions of seniors and disabled who depend on it. With offices shutting down, seniors and disabled Americans will have to travel absurd distances to verify their identity, worsening an already slow system.Source: CNNTrump Targets IRS Taxpayer Help Office in Latest CutsWhat Happened: Trump is slashing staff at the National Taxpayer Advocate office, which assists taxpayers and reports to Congress on IRS service levels. The move follows reports that 25% of NTA staff will be laid off, with overall IRS workforce reductions nearing 20%.Why It Matters: This weakens taxpayer protections, making it harder for individuals to challenge the IRS or receive assistance. It also undermines tax enforcement by cutting thousands of compliance officers, benefiting wealthy tax cheats and Trump\u2019s allies.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchChinese Nationalists Praise Trump\u2019s Cuts to Voice of AmericaWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order dismantling the Agency for Global Media, cutting off funding for Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Hundreds of journalists were placed on leave, and broadcasts into China, Xinjiang, and Tibet were halted.Why It Matters: This eliminates key sources of independent news for people living under authoritarian regimes, effectively handing a victory to Beijing. Chinese state media and officials are openly celebrating the shutdown, while Russian reaction has been equally ecstatic\u2014viewing it as a collapse of U.S. influence.Source: The New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump and Putin Hold Talks That Benefit RussiaWhat Happened: Trump and Putin held a 90-minute call, agreeing only to a limited ceasefire on Ukraine\u2019s energy and infrastructure. Hours later, Kyiv was under attack. Russia rejected a full ceasefire and demanded an end to Western military aid and intel sharing before further talks\u2014something Trump\u2019s readout conveniently omitted. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s so-called diplomacy is a smokescreen for legitimizing Russia\u2019s war and forcing Ukraine into surrender. By prioritizing \u201ceconomic deals\u201d and restoring Russia\u2019s global standing, he is openly siding with Putin over Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. Just hours after the call, Russia escalated attacks, striking Ukrainian cities and taking out power\u2014exposing the ceasefire as a sham.Source: CBS NewsTrump considers giving up NATO command that has been exclusively American since EisenhowerWhat Happened: Trump is considering relinquishing the U.S.\u2019s 75-year-long role as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) as part of a \u201ccost-cutting\u201d military restructuring. The move would mark a fundamental shift in NATO leadership, handing control to European allies while consolidating U.S. European and African commands.Why It Matters: Handing over NATO\u2019s top command would be a major step toward Trump\u2019s long-threatened withdrawal from the alliance. Military experts warn it would weaken deterrence against Russia, embolden Putin, and gut U.S. influence\u2014all to save a pathetic 0.03% of the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Another blatant gift to Moscow.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump policies \u2018promise\u2019 an economic downturn, says prominent forecaster in first-ever \u2018recession watch\u2019What Happened: The UCLA Anderson Forecast issued its first-ever \u201crecession watch,\u201d warning that Trump\u2019s tariffs, immigration crackdowns, and federal workforce cuts could trigger an economic downturn. The forecast states that if these policies are fully enacted, they \u201cpromise a recession\u201d by creating labor shortages, raising prices, and shrinking government and manufacturing employment.Why It Matters: The warning signals growing concerns that Trump\u2019s policies could destabilize the economy, with rising recession risks and potential stagflation. Trump has not denied the likelihood of a downturn, with officials calling it a \u201ctransition\u201d period and gaslighting a recession would be \u201cworth it.\u201dSource: CNBCTrump\u2019s Tariffs Set to Drive Up Car Prices\u2014Buyers\u2019 Window for Discounts Closing FastWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and auto imports from Mexico and Canada are set to take full effect by April 2, leading to expected price hikes of $4,000 to $12,500 per vehicle. Experts warn that waiting to buy a car or auto parts will only cost consumers more.Why It Matters: The tariffs are already disrupting auto manufacturing and could shrink North American vehicle production by up to 20,000 units per day. Consumer confidence is rattled, with auto loan rejection fears at a record high. Dealers will soon cut rebates and financing promotions, making cars even less affordable.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge blocks Trump's executive order barring transgender people from the militaryWhat Happened: A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against Trump\u2019s executive order barring transgender individuals from serving in the military.

The court ordered the immediate reinstatement of USAID systems and barred Musk from further interference without agency approval.Source: NBC NewsChief Justice Roberts Rebukes Trump\u2019s Call to Impeach Judge Who Blocked DeportationsWhat Happened: Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public statement rejecting Trump\u2019s call to impeach Judge James Boasberg.

The ruling prevents the EPA, led by Lee Zeldin, from terminating funding agreements with three environmental nonprofits and stops Citibank from withholding grant funds.Source: ReutersRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Sues Trump Over Canceled ContractWhat Happened: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) has filed a federal lawsuit against Trump after the U.S. Agency for Global Media froze its funding and put its journalists on leave.

The event, unlike a previous similar dinner, was not listed on Trump\u2019s public schedule. Meanwhile, as Trump and Musk dined, his regime defied a federal court order by deporting alleged Venezuelan \u201cgang members.\u201d</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> These secretive pay-for-play fundraisers highlight major corruption, allowing billionaires and business elites to buy direct access to Trump.

The event, unlike a previous similar dinner, was not listed on Trump\\u2019s public schedule. Meanwhile, as Trump and Musk dined, his regime defied a federal court order by deporting alleged Venezuelan \\u201Cgang members.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These secretive pay-for-play fundraisers highlight major corruption, allowing billionaires and business elites to buy direct access to Trump.

The deleted posts included critical insights on how companies should handle AI, children\\u2019s data, and surveillance technology.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This purge benefits Big Tech by erasing accountability measures and compliance guidelines, making it easier for companies to exploit consumer data without oversight. This aligns with Trump\\u2019s broader push to dismantle regulatory safeguards.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Russia Seeks Mars Talks With Musk Amid His Expanding Political Role</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Russia\\u2019s envoy for international cooperation, Kirill Dmitriev, again announced plans to discuss Mars exploration with Musk. Moscow wants to expand space collaboration with the U.S. despite its ongoing genocidal war. Musk has previously secretly communicated with Putin and played a key role in limiting Ukraine\\u2019s access to Starlink during the war.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s unchecked influence in global politics continues to grow, blurring the line between private industry, U.S. government policy, and Russian interests.

A security alarm was triggered when a Musk employee accessed the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\\u2019s roof without prior coordination.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk faces growing conflict-of-interest, especially as he continues to expand his federal contracts. Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are demanding an investigation into potential criminal corruption as Musk consolidates unprecedented power.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/musk-starlink-internet-white-house\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>\\u2018It\\u2019s a Heist\\u2019: Real Federal Auditors Are Horrified by DOGE</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Federal auditors say Musk\\u2019s unauthorized DOGE is not conducting real audits but recklessly accessing sensitive government data. Musk\\u2019s operatives have ignored proper auditing procedures, falsely labeled errors as fraud, and rushed through federal systems without understanding them\\u2014sparking fears surveillance and misuse of government contracts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk\\u2019s actions are a blatant data grab, not a legitimate audit, with Musk using his unchecked power to dismantle federal agencies and target political opponents.

Plaintiffs argue that if left unchecked, Trump could designate any group as \\\\\\\"enemy aliens\\\\\\\" and deport them arbitrarily. A federal judge blocked some deportations, but the regime defied his order by allowing flights to continue over international waters.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s use of wartime powers to bypass immigration laws sets a dangerous precedent, allowing mass deportations without judicial oversight.

With a Republican-controlled Senate, confirmations are expected to move quickly, further solidifying Trump's grip on the judiciary.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump wants to reshape the courts to erase the last checks on his power, ensuring a judiciary that will rubber-stamp his policies and shield him from legal challenges. With potential Supreme Court vacancies on the horizon, this is a power grab that threatens judicial independence and the rule of law.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-judges-nominations-process-courts-00236800\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Fires Democratic FTC Commissioners, Defying Supreme Court Precedent</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired Democratic Federal Trade Commission members Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, breaking long-standing precedent protecting independent regulators.

Trump again called for Boasberg\\u2019s impeachment, despite Chief Justice John Roberts\\u2019 warning that impeachment should not be used to punish judicial rulings.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is authoritarian theater\\u2014it won\\u2019t succeed, but it demonstrates the Republican Party\\u2019s cult-like loyalty to Trump.

The DOJ argued that providing the requested information would compromise national security and foreign relations. In response, Boasberg ordered the government to submit answers in a sealed filing by noon Wednesday.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s defiance of judicial authority and defying court orders is a Constitutional crisis.

Trump-appointed official Peter Marocco declared himself IAF\\u2019s leader, fired staff, cut grants, and attempted to recall already-disbursed funds\\u2014effectively gutting the agency.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is yet another Congress-created agency falling under Trump\\u2019s direct control, showing that Congress is no longer a check on executive power. The dismantling of IAF threatens U.S. efforts to combat poverty, migration, and instability in Latin America, while handing control to political loyalists.

The MTA must submit a security plan by March 31. The move comes the same day the MTA refused to halt congestion pricing, a policy Trump opposes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: This is political retaliation disguised as a safety measure. Trump is using federal funds as leverage to pressure Democratic-led New York while targeting policies it doesn\\u2019t like.

Trump accused Boasberg of being a \\\\\\\"Radical Left Lunatic\\\\\\\" and an \\\\\\\"agitator,\\\\\\\" escalating his ongoing attacks on the judiciary. In response, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement, reaffirming that impeachment is not a response to judicial decisions and that the appellate process exists for such disputes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump's defiance of court orders, including ignoring Boasberg's ruling to halt deportations, represents a dangerous authoritarian turn.

The move follows Trump\\u2019s executive order rolling back civil rights protections, including equal employment policies from 1965.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a sickening rollback of civil rights, reversing fundamental anti-discrimination protections in government contracting.
