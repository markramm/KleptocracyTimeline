This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ize2tO9wo7BCGqa0AGeK82sK_6DFVny5TRM4SQiRAD8/editDon\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump\u2019s Crypto Playbook Is Now ClearWhat Happened: At the 2025 Bitcoin Conference, Trump\u2019s allies\u2014from J.D. Vance to Don Jr.\u2014tied crypto\u2019s libertarian ideals to Trump\u2019s political movement. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s family has launched multiple meme coins, taken stakes in crypto firms, and Trump Media is buying $2.5 billion in bitcoin. At the same time, Trump\u2019s regime is slashing regulations, easing 401 (k) restrictions, and dropping investigations into crypto firms.Why It Matters: Trump is fusing government policy with personal gain\u2014dismantling oversight, inflating crypto markets, and aligning national economic policy with his private crypto empire. What began as a decentralized alternative to state power is now being centralized around Trump.Source: The Atlantic\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsNoem asked Hegseth to direct troops to \"arrest rioters to help restore law and order\"What Happened: Kristi Noem asked Pete Hegseth to authorize U.S. troops in Los Angeles to arrest protesters during anti-immigration demonstrations. The request, revealed in a leaked letter, exceeds legal limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The Pentagon has not responded publicly.Why It Matters: Noem\u2019s demand signals a dangerous escalation\u2014using the military to police Americans and crush dissent. It challenges core constitutional protections and reinforces Trump\u2019s push for authoritarian control.Source: CBS NewsSuggesting More Troops in More Cities, Trump Bends Military\u2019s RoleWhat Happened: Trump deployed thousands of troops to Los Angeles\u2014surpassing U.S. troop levels in Iraq and Syria\u2014without state approval, invoking rare emergency powers and hinting at using the Insurrection Act to crush protests over his deportation crackdown.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the military against civilians, eroding constitutional norms, and redefining protests as a national security threat. This escalation risks turning political dissent into a battlefield\u2014and democracy into a police state.Source: New York Times\u2018This isn\u2019t an isolated incident\u2019: Trump\u2019s show of military force in LA was years in the makingWhat Happened: Trump deployed U.S. Marines and federalized the National Guard in Los Angeles to crush protests over mass deportations, defying state leaders and escalating tensions. This is a calculated move to test military force in Democratic strongholds and stage a media spectacle amid political turmoil.Why It Matters: Trump is escalating by militarizing domestic policy, demonizing immigrants, and using force to intimidate civil society. Los Angeles is the first test\u2014and like in Russia, the crackdown will spread to other cities that resist.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsU.S. Military Authorized to Temporarily Detain Protesters in Los AngelesWhat Happened: Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman confirmed that National Guard troops and Marines deployed to Los Angeles can temporarily detain protesters during ICE raids but cannot formally arrest them. About 500 Guard members have been trained to assist ICE with \"force protection.\" California officials have sued, arguing that the deployment is unconstitutional.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s use of troops alongside ICE blurs legal lines, undermines state authority, and paves the path for militarized repression.Source: ABC NewsMarines Deployed to LA Authorized to Detain Protesters,What Happened: Active-duty U.S. Marines have been deployed to Los Angeles to assist federal agents during protests against Trump\u2019s immigration raids. Pentagon officials confirmed they are authorized to temporarily detain civilians\u2014even without the Insurrection Act being invoked.Why It Matters: This erodes the legal barrier between civilian law enforcement and military power and echoes authoritarian regimes, where troops are used to suppress dissent. California officials are challenging the deployment in court, arguing that it poses a threat to civil liberties.Source: Military.comUnder Pressure From the White House, ICE Seeks New Ways to Ramp Up ArrestsWhat Happened: Under pressure from Trump and Stephen Miller, ICE is conducting aggressive nationwide raids, using a new app dubbed \"Alien Tracker\"\u2014developed with Musk\u2019s operatives\u2014to map and detain undocumented immigrants using cross-agency data.Why It Matters: This is a high-tech, high-volume crackdown that bypasses due process and violates privacy. Trump\u2019s team merged federal databases, weaponizing surveillance against immigrants as a test case. It won\u2019t stop there and will be expanded to all Americans.Source: New York TimesCBP Confirms Use of Predator Drones Over Los Angeles ProtestsWhat Happened: Customs and Border Protection admitted it is flying Predator drones above Los Angeles to support ICE during ongoing immigration raids and protests. The confirmation came after flight data and air traffic recordings uncovered the unmarked drone activity by DHS over the weekend.Why It Matters: Deploying military-grade surveillance drones on U.S. soil to monitor protests marks a chilling expansion of government surveillance powers. This mirrors tactics used in authoritarian regimes like Russia, blurring the lines between civil law enforcement and domestic spying.Source: 404 MediaRubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into HarvardWhat Happened: Marco Rubio urged the Treasury Department to investigate Harvard University for sanctions violations after it joined a Chinese health conference.Why It Matters: Trump is using Harvard as a test case to see how far he can go in his war on universities. By invoking foreign sanctions law to target a domestic institution, he continues weaponizing national security tools to punish dissent.Source: New York TimesInside DOJ\u2019s \u201cRubber Room\u201d: Veteran Lawyers Sidelined Under TrumpWhat Happened: Under Trump\u2019s DOJ purge, experienced civil rights and national security attorneys were reassigned to a fake \u201cSanctuary Cities\u201d task force\u2014nicknamed the \u201crubber room\u201d\u2014where they were given no legal work and left to do puzzles and stream TV.Why It Matters: Trump is gutting the DOJ from within\u2014punishing career lawyers, erasing expertise, and replacing them with loyalists. It\u2019s a quiet but devastating assault on civil service independence, leaving key departments hollowed out and repurposed to carry out Trump\u2019s agenda.Source: CBS NewsGuard Soldiers Deployed in Trump\u2019s LA Crackdown Aren\u2019t Getting Paid YetWhat Happened: Over 4,000 California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles under Trump\u2019s orders remain unpaid due to delayed activation paperwork. Without formal orders, troops lack access to pay, health benefits, and housing allowances. Some are sleeping outside on cots, with insufficient food, water, and fuel, while the mission's cost is projected at $134 million.Why It Matters: The rushed, chaotic deployment reflects Trump\u2019s disregard for the military, using the National Guard as political props while leaving soldiers in limbo with plummeting morale and no local support.Source: Military.comSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsBragg Soldiers Who Cheered Trump's Political Attacks While in Uniform Were Checked for Allegiance, AppearanceWhat Happened: During a speech at Fort Bragg, Trump attacked political opponents while uniformed soldiers\u2014handpicked for loyalty and appearance\u2014cheered him on, violating military rules on political neutrality. Internal communications show troops were screened for allegiance, \u201cfat soldiers\u201d were explicitly excluded, dissenters were sidelined, and campaign merchandise was sold on base.Why It Matters: This staged display crosses a red line\u2014militarizing partisan politics and undermining the U.S. tradition of an apolitical armed forces. The shameful spectacle mirrors the carefully orchestrated propaganda theatrics of Putin\u2014where events are staged to project power and support.Source: Military.com\u2018Unacceptable\u2019: Police Target Journalists Covering LA ProtestsWhat Happened: Journalists reporting on protests in Los Angeles against Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown say they\u2019ve been assaulted and detained by law enforcement. Incidents include rubber bullet injuries, pepper ball fire, and unlawful detentions\u2014even while live on air. At least 27 attacks on journalists have been recorded since June 6th.Why It Matters: These acts mark a chilling escalation against press freedom. Journalism groups warn that targeting reporters is meant to restrict public access to the truth. It has become increasingly difficult for journalists to operate in the U.S.Source: The GuardianFulbright Board Resigns After Accusing Trump Aides of Political InterferenceWhat Happened: All 12 members of the Fulbright Board resigned, accusing Trump of illegally canceling nearly 200 American scholarships based on political ideology. Trump appointees reportedly rejected scholars for researching topics like climate change, gender, and migration, interfering with a congressionally mandated, nonpartisan process.Why It Matters: This mass resignation signals a breakdown of one of the world\u2019s most respected academic exchange programs and reiterates the unprecedented politicization of U.S. diplomacy and global education. Trump\u2019s purge of opponents continues targeting academic freedom, U.S. soft power, and international goodwill.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsSome Los Angeles officials fear Marines' 'rules of force'What Happened: Trump deployed 700 U.S. Marines alongside National Guard troops to Los Angeles to support ICE raids, alarming California officials and law enforcement. The Marines lack civilian law enforcement training and may violate the Posse Comitatus Act. A federal judge is now reviewing a legal challenge to block the deployment.Why It Matters: Using active-duty military for immigration enforcement is a major and possibly unlawful expansion of federal power, one used by authoritarian regimes. Trump\u2019s push to create a police state risks confusion, overreach, and violence on American streets.Source: NBC NewsTrump to ramp up transfers to Guant\u00e1namo, including citizens of alliesWhat Happened: Trump is preparing to transfer up to 9,000 undocumented migrants\u2014including citizens from allied nations like Britain, France, Italy, and Ukraine\u2014to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Documents show the White House is pushing for mass arrests and removals without notifying foreign governments.Why It Matters: Detaining foreign nationals at Guant\u00e1namo without due process will spark international outrage and violate global legal norms. The move evokes the worst abuses of the post-9/11 era and marks a dangerous expansion of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.Source: Washington PostFamilies Arrested in LA ICE Raids Held in Basements With Little Food or Water, Lawyers SayWhat Happened: After Trump\u2019s ICE raids in Los Angeles, immigrant families\u2014including children\u2014were held in basements for days without beds, food, or medical care. Some were disappeared without legal access or due process, with reports of racial profiling and constitutional violations.Why It Matters: These are human rights abuses\u2014Trump is criminalizing communities, denying civil rights and basic care, and using fear as official policy. Advocates warn that the deliberate erosion of due process is expanding and threatens core democratic protections.Source: The GuardianKosovo Agrees to Accept U.S. Deportations of Migrants from Other CountriesWhat Happened: Kosovo agreed to Trump\u2019s request to temporarily host 50 migrants deported from the U.S., despite none being Kosovar citizens. The deal is part of Trump\u2019s expanding third-country deportation network aimed at migrants whose home countries refuse reentry.Why It Matters: Trump is building a global patchwork of deportation deals to sidestep asylum laws and forcibly remove migrants. This mirrors authoritarian tactics\u2014offloading vulnerable people into legal limbo with no protections.Source: CBS NewsImmigration Raid at Omaha Meat Plant Sparks Outrage and FearWhat Happened: ICE agents raided Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha, detaining around 70 workers in what\u2019s being called Nebraska\u2019s largest workplace immigration operation of Trump\u2019s second term. Company officials say they complied with all federal rules and used E-Verify. Why It Matters: The raid signals a new phase of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, targeting critical industries even when businesses follow federal verification protocols. Immigration communities continue living in fear, and local leaders are blindsided.Source: Associated PressTennessee Sues Over Grants to Hispanic-Serving CollegesWhat Happened: Tennessee\u2019s Republican Attorney General and the group behind the anti-affirmative action Supreme Court ruling are suing the U.S. Education Department to block grants for Hispanic-Serving Institutions. They argue the funding, aimed at schools with 25%+ Hispanic enrollment, is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201dWhy It Matters: Seeing Trump as a model, Republican-led states are escalating efforts to dismantle diversity programs by reframing them as \u201cracial discrimination.\u201d Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump says FEMA to be wound down after hurricane seasonWhat Happened: Trump announced he will phase out FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season, redirecting disaster aid funding to the White House. Under the plan, states will get less federal support and must handle most disasters independently, with only catastrophic events qualifying for federal intervention.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling another vital emergency agency and consolidating control over disaster aid, turning lifesaving relief into a political weapon. Loyalty will be required to get disaster relief.Source: ReutersStates would struggle to administer food stamp benefits under Republican tax billWhat Happened: The Republican House tax bill would shift $22 billion in SNAP (food stamp) costs to states. Beginning in 2028, states would be responsible for up to 25% of benefit payouts and 75% of administrative costs.Why It Matters: More than 41 million Americans rely on SNAP. Experts warn the bill will force states to cut eligibility or exit the program entirely, potentially pushing over 4 million people off food aid. Critics call it an unsustainable move that endangers the poor and drains state resources.Source: ReutersTrump EPA moves to repeal climate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from US power plantsWhat Happened: The EPA, led by Lee Zeldin, proposed repealing key rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas power plants and weakening mercury emissions standards. The agency claims the move will cut industry costs and \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.Why It Matters: These rollbacks reverse Obama and Biden-era protections and will disproportionately harm low-income, Black, and Latino communities already burdened by pollution. Public health experts warn the changes endanger children and violate clean air laws. Source: Associated PressSenators Warn DOGE\u2019s Social Security Administration Work Could Break BenefitsWhat Happened: Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden warned that the Trump-Musk unauthorized DOGE is jeopardizing Social Security by rushing an AI-driven IT overhaul. Since Musk operatives began work, the SSA website has suffered outages and access failures, raising alarms about benefit disruptions, data loss, and hacking risks.Why It Matters: This reckless digital experiment threatens to collapse one of America\u2019s most vital safety nets. Warren calls it a \u201crecipe for disaster\u201d that puts millions of elderly and disabled Americans at risk.Source: WIREDMajor US Climate Website Likely to Shut Down After Staff Fired in Trump-Era PurgeWhat Happened: NOAA\u2019s Climate.gov is halting new content after nearly all editorial staff were purged on May 31. Insiders say the purge was politically driven, part of Trump\u2019s effort to shut down public-facing climate education.Why It Matters: This is another direct attack on science communication. Experts warn that the move not only silences trusted climate data but opens the door for the site to be repurposed for propaganda, erasing decades of bipartisan scientific integrity.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchViews of the U.S. under Trump dip sharply in many allied countriesWhat Happened: A new Pew poll shows global approval of the U.S. and confidence in Trump plummeting across allied nations. Favorability dropped sharply in Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Mexico, while support rose in right-leaning countries like Hungary and Israel. Sweden\u2019s approval alone fell from 47% to 19%.Why It Matters: The poll highlights collapsing global trust in U.S. leadership under Trump, straining alliances, and weakening America\u2019s influence. Support is increasingly limited to far-right populists and authoritarian-leaning governments.Source: NBC NewsMcConnell Tells Hegseth America\u2019s Reputation Is at Stake in Ukraine WarWhat Happened: At a heated Senate hearing, Senator Mitch McConnell slammed Pete Hegseth over the absence of Ukraine aid in Trump\u2019s Pentagon budget, warning it damages U.S. credibility. Lindsey Graham backed him, accusing Hegseth of underestimating Putin\u2019s threats and enabling further Russian aggression.Why It Matters: The clash highlights GOP divisions over Ukraine. Traditional Republicans warn that abandoning Ukraine emboldens Putin and weakens global alliances, while Trump loyalists push isolationism.Source: New York TimesNorth Korea \u2018refuses to accept Trump\u2019s letter to Kim Jong-un\u2019What Happened: North Korea reportedly rejected a personal letter from Trump to Kim Jong-un, turning away repeated delivery attempts via the UN. Why It Matters: With military support from Russia and economic aid from China, North Korea no longer needs Trump\u2019s theatrics. The rejection highlights the failure of Trump\u2019s diplomacy as it expands its nuclear program.Source: The TimesPentagon Is Reviewing Deal to Equip Australia With Nuclear SubmarinesWhat Happened: Trump is reviewing the landmark AUKUS deal that would equip Australia with nuclear submarines, questioning whether it meets \"America First\" standards. Why It Matters: Australia has invested billions and staked its future defense strategy on this deal to counter China. Trump\u2019s transactional approach threatens to unravel a key Pacific alliance, undermining deterrence efforts and trust among U.S. allies.Source: New York TimesU.S. Moves to Withdraw Some Middle East Personnel as Iran Tensions RiseWhat Happened: The U.S. is withdrawing nonessential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad and authorizing departures from Bahrain and Kuwait amid rising tensions with Iran. Pete Hegseth also approved voluntary departures of military dependents, as nuclear talks falter and potential Israeli strikes grow.Why It Matters: Oil prices surged nearly 5% on fears of escalation, as Trump openly questioned diplomacy and Iran warned U.S. bases are within striking distance.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchAs Military Deploys to LA, Rightwing Media Decry Protesters as \u2018Invaders\u2019What Happened: In response to protests over mass ICE raids in Los Angeles, rightwing media figures escalated their rhetoric\u2014labeling demonstrators \u201cinvaders,\u201d calling for the arrests of Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, and urging military crackdowns. Fox News, Newsmax, and pro-Trump influencers invoked the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory and pushed for Trump to use the Insurrection Act.Why It Matters: The fusion of violent rhetoric, racist conspiracy theories, and calls for military force against Americans marks a dangerous escalation in authoritarian propaganda. As Trump defies state leaders by deploying troops, rightwing media is laying the ideological groundwork to normalize repression and criminalize dissent.Source: The GuardianNew Russian Ambassador Meets Trump as Rubio Sends Russia Day GreetingWhat Happened: Russia\u2019s new war criminal ambassador to the U.S., Alexander Darchiev, presented his credentials to Trump and pledged to restore ties with Washington, praising Trump\u2019s \u201cconstructive\u201d approach over Biden\u2019s. Meanwhile, Marco Rubio issued a celebratory Russia Day greeting: \u201cOn behalf of the American people,\u201d the U.S. supports the Russian people\u2019s \u201caspirations for a brighter future,\u201d and reaffirmed the United States\u2019 desire for \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with Russia.Why It Matters: Darchiev\u2019s warm reception at the White House and Rubio\u2019s appeasement message reiterates a chilling normalization of Putin\u2019s regime\u2014despite its ongoing genocide and war crimes in Ukraine. Trump continues embracing Moscow, and the majority of Republicans are helping him.Source: RIA Novosti, State Department\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsNew China Trade \u2018Deal\u2019 Takes U.S. Back to Where It StartedWhat Happened: The U.S. and China reached a tentative handshake deal in London to de-escalate Trump\u2019s self-inflicted trade war. The agreement would reverse some tariffs and restrictions imposed in recent months, with China easing mineral export limits and the U.S. loosening tech and visa bans.Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s bluster, the proposed agreement merely returns the U.S. to where it was before his April tariff escalation. Analysts say it exposes the lack of any real strategy\u2014just chaos and political theater. The trade war damaged U.S. industries, strained alliances, and destabilized the global economy.Source: New York TimesTrump says Fed should lower rates by 'one full point'What Happened: Following new inflation data, Trump called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by one full percentage point, claiming it would lower debt costs. The demand comes despite expectations that Trump's tariffs will fuel higher inflation in the coming months.Why It Matters: By pressuring an independent Fed to act in his political interest, he risks triggering a deeper recession, fueling inflation, and undermining the credibility of U.S. monetary policy.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News50501 EventsCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Pastor Jamal Harrison Bryant on Target boycott \u2018victory\u2019 and the Black dollar\u2019s power: \u2018They\u2019ve awakened a sleeping giant\u2019What Happened: Georgia megachurch pastor Jamal Harrison Bryant led a highly visible boycott of Target after the company rolled back its DEI commitments, including a pledged $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses.

The agreement would reverse some tariffs and restrictions imposed in recent months, with China easing mineral export limits and the U.S. loosening tech and visa bans.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Despite Trump\u2019s bluster, the proposed agreement merely returns the U.S. to where it was before his April tariff escalation. Analysts say it exposes the lack of any real strategy\u2014just chaos and political theater. The trade war damaged U.S. industries, strained alliances, and destabilized the global economy.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/us-china-trade-deal-trump.html\" rel=\"\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Trump says Fed should lower rates by 'one full point'<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7trump-says-fed-should-lower-rates-by-one-full-point\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/165800500/trump-says-fed-should-lower-rates-by-one-full-point\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Following new inflation data, Trump called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by one full percentage point, claiming it would lower debt costs.

Meanwhile, Trump\\u2019s family has launched multiple meme coins, taken stakes in crypto firms, and Trump Media is buying $2.5 billion in bitcoin. At the same time, Trump\\u2019s regime is slashing regulations, easing 401 (k) restrictions, and dropping investigations into crypto firms.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is fusing government policy with personal gain\\u2014dismantling oversight, inflating crypto markets, and aligning national economic policy with his private crypto empire.

The request, revealed in a leaked letter, exceeds legal limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The Pentagon has not responded publicly.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Noem\\u2019s demand signals a dangerous escalation\\u2014using the military to police Americans and crush dissent.

This is a calculated move to test military force in Democratic strongholds and stage a media spectacle amid political turmoil.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is escalating by militarizing domestic policy, demonizing immigrants, and using force to intimidate civil society. Los Angeles is the first test\\u2014and like in Russia, the crackdown will spread to other cities that resist.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/trump-military-force-plotting\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>U.S. Military Authorized to Temporarily Detain Protesters in Los Angeles</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Maj.

About 500 Guard members have been trained to assist ICE with \\\\\\\"force protection.\\\\\\\" California officials have sued, arguing that the deployment is unconstitutional.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s use of troops alongside ICE blurs legal lines, undermines state authority, and paves the path for militarized repression.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-military-temporarily-detain-protesters-los-angeles-commander/story?id=122736204\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Marines Deployed to LA Authorized to Detain Protesters,</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Active-duty U.S. Marines have been deployed to Los Angeles to assist federal agents during protests against Trump\\u2019s immigration raids. Pentagon officials confirmed they are authorized to temporarily detain civilians\\u2014even without the Insurrection Act being invoked.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This erodes the legal barrier between civilian law enforcement and military power and echoes authoritarian regimes, where troops are used to suppress dissent.

The confirmation came after flight data and air traffic recordings uncovered the unmarked drone activity by DHS over the weekend.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Deploying military-grade surveillance drones on U.S. soil to monitor protests marks a chilling expansion of government surveillance powers.

Without formal orders, troops lack access to pay, health benefits, and housing allowances. Some are sleeping outside on cots, with insufficient food, water, and fuel, while the mission's cost is projected at $134 million.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The rushed, chaotic deployment reflects Trump\\u2019s disregard for the military, using the National Guard as political props while leaving soldiers in limbo with plummeting morale and no local support.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/06/11/guard-soldiers-deployed-trumps-la-crackdown-arent-getting-paid-yet.html\\\\\\\">Military.com</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Bragg Soldiers Who Cheered Trump's Political Attacks While in Uniform Were Checked for Allegiance, Appearance</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> During a speech at Fort Bragg, Trump attacked political opponents while uniformed soldiers\\u2014handpicked for loyalty and appearance\\u2014cheered him on, violating military rules on political neutrality. Internal communications show troops were screened for allegiance, \\u201Cfat soldiers\\u201D were explicitly excluded, dissenters were sidelined, and campaign merchandise was sold on base.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This staged display crosses a red line\\u2014militarizing partisan politics and undermining the U.S. tradition of an apolitical armed forces.

Incidents include rubber bullet injuries, pepper ball fire, and unlawful detentions\\u2014even while live on air. At least 27 attacks on journalists have been recorded since June 6th.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These acts mark a chilling escalation against press freedom. Journalism groups warn that targeting reporters is meant to restrict public access to the truth. It has become increasingly difficult for journalists to operate in the U.S.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/journalists-los-angeles-protests-attacks\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Fulbright Board Resigns After Accusing Trump Aides of Political Interference</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> All 12 members of the Fulbright Board resigned, accusing Trump of illegally canceling nearly 200 American scholarships based on political ideology. Trump appointees reportedly rejected scholars for researching topics like climate change, gender, and migration, interfering with a congressionally mandated, nonpartisan process.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This mass resignation signals a breakdown of one of the world\\u2019s most respected academic exchange programs and reiterates the unprecedented politicization of U.S. diplomacy and global education.

The Marines lack civilian law enforcement training and may violate the Posse Comitatus Act. A federal judge is now reviewing a legal challenge to block the deployment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Using active-duty military for immigration enforcement is a major and possibly unlawful expansion of federal power, one used by authoritarian regimes.

Documents show the White House is pushing for mass arrests and removals without notifying foreign governments.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Detaining foreign nationals at Guant\\u00E1namo without due process will spark international outrage and violate global legal norms.

Some were disappeared without legal access or due process, with reports of racial profiling and constitutional violations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These are human rights abuses\\u2014Trump is criminalizing communities, denying civil rights and basic care, and using fear as official policy.

The deal is part of Trump\\u2019s expanding third-country deportation network aimed at migrants whose home countries refuse reentry.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is building a global patchwork of deportation deals to sidestep asylum laws and forcibly remove migrants. This mirrors authoritarian tactics\\u2014offloading vulnerable people into legal limbo with no protections.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kosovo-accept-u-s-deportations-of-migrants-from-other-countries/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Immigration Raid at Omaha Meat Plant Sparks Outrage and Fear</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE agents raided Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha, detaining around 70 workers in what\\u2019s being called Nebraska\\u2019s largest workplace immigration operation of Trump\\u2019s second term. Company officials say they complied with all federal rules and used E-Verify. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The raid signals a new phase of Trump\\u2019s immigration crackdown, targeting critical industries even when businesses follow federal verification protocols.

Under the plan, states will get less federal support and must handle most disasters independently, with only catastrophic events qualifying for federal intervention.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is dismantling another vital emergency agency and consolidating control over disaster aid, turning lifesaving relief into a political weapon.

Beginning in 2028, states would be responsible for up to 25% of benefit payouts and 75% of administrative costs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> More than 41 million Americans rely on SNAP. Experts warn the bill will force states to cut eligibility or exit the program entirely, potentially pushing over 4 million people off food aid. Critics call it an unsustainable move that endangers the poor and drains state resources.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/states-would-struggle-administer-food-stamp-benefits-under-republican-tax-bill-2025-06-11/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump EPA moves to repeal climate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from US power plants</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The EPA, led by Lee Zeldin, proposed repealing key rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas power plants and weakening mercury emissions standards. The agency claims the move will cut industry costs and \\u201Cunleash\\u201D American energy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These rollbacks reverse Obama and Biden-era protections and will disproportionately harm low-income, Black, and Latino communities already burdened by pollution.

Insiders say the purge was politically driven, part of Trump\\u2019s effort to shut down public-facing climate education.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is another direct attack on science communication. Experts warn that the move not only silences trusted climate data but opens the door for the site to be repurposed for propaganda, erasing decades of bipartisan scientific integrity.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/climate-website-shut-down-noaa\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Views of the U.S. under Trump dip sharply in many allied countries</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A new Pew poll shows global approval of the U.S. and confidence in Trump plummeting across allied nations.

Sweden\\u2019s approval alone fell from 47% to 19%.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The poll highlights collapsing global trust in U.S. leadership under Trump, straining alliances, and weakening America\\u2019s influence.

Lindsey Graham backed him, accusing Hegseth of underestimating Putin\\u2019s threats and enabling further Russian aggression.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The clash highlights GOP divisions over Ukraine.
