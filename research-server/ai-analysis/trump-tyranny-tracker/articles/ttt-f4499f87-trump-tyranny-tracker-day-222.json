Its aim: to sow discord, promote Donald Trump, and damage Hillary Clinton\u2026Read more6 days ago \u00b7 83 likes \u00b7 8 comments \u00b7 Olga Lautman and Julie Roginsky\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsThe White House Apparently Ordered Federal Workers to Roll Out Grok \u2018ASAP\u2019What Happened: Despite a collapsed partnership after Grok praised Hitler on X, the White House ordered the GSA to add Musk\u2019s chatbot back onto its approved vendor list \u201cASAP,\u201d internal emails show. With the update, Grok 3 and 4 are now available for rollout across federal agencies through Carahsoft.Why It Matters: Trump is forcing Musk\u2019s unstable AI into federal systems after it already spewed antisemitic content. Again Trump puts loyalty over security as he puts workers and citizens at risk.Source: WIRED\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump moves to rescind $4.9 billion in foreign aid, earning pushback from Capitol HillWhat Happened: Trump invoked a rarely used \u201cpocket rescission\u201d to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid already approved by Congress, targeting State Department and USAID programs. Lawmakers from both parties blasted the move as unlawful, with Sen. Susan Collins warning it violates Congress\u2019s constitutional power of the purse.Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying Congress to gut foreign aid, breaking decades of precedent and edging toward one-man rule over federal spending. By seizing budget powers reserved for lawmakers, he risks a constitutional crisis and a government shutdown.Source: CBS NewsTrump Administration Weighs Having Military Lawyers Work as Immigration JudgesWhat Happened: Trump is weighing a plan to deploy about 600 military lawyers as temporary immigration judges to accelerate deportations. A new DOJ rule already loosened requirements so \u201cany lawyer\u201d can serve as a judge, clearing the way for JAG officers with no immigration law training to take the bench.Why It Matters: Militarizing civilian courts shreds judicial independence and due process in immigration cases. It\u2019s another step in Trump\u2019s push to use the military for domestic enforcement \u2014 a dangerous authoritarian overreach that weaponizes immigration policy.Source: New York TimesMissouri's GOP governor calls special session to redraw congressional districtsWhat Happened: Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map, following Trump\u2019s push for mid-decade redistricting like Texas. His proposed \u201cMissouri First Map\u201d significantly reshapes Rep. Emanuel Cleaver\u2019s Democratic 5th District, aiming to hand Republicans another seat ahead of the 2026 midterms.Why It Matters: By carving up Democratic districts, Republicans are entrenching minority rule, silencing voters, and normalizing unconstitutional power grabs to lock in MAGA power.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s CDC fight is about stamping out dissentWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s dismissal of CDC Director Susan Monarez \u2014 pushed by RFK Jr. and followed by mass resignations \u2014 is less about vaccines and more about eliminating dissent. Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader campaign to consolidate power by sidelining experts across government. By gutting institutions like the CDC, Fed, and FEMA, Trump is replacing empirical science and oversight with loyalty tests. The result isn\u2019t efficiency \u2014 it\u2019s a state where evidence is irrelevant and ideology rules.Source: NBC NewsTrump Asserts Expansive Power to Fire Fed GovernorWhat Happened: In court Friday, Trump\u2019s lawyers claimed the president has broad authority to fire Federal Reserve governors \u201cfor cause\u201d with little judicial review, as they defended his dismissal of Lisa Cook over unproven mortgage fraud allegations. Cook\u2019s attorneys argued the firing was politically motivated, tied to Trump\u2019s push to force the Fed to cut interest rates.Why It Matters: The case will decide whether the Fed remains independent or becomes a White House tool. If Trump prevails, presidents could fire central bank officials for political reasons \u2014 gutting the Fed\u2019s independence, destabilizing U.S. markets, and eroding global confidence in the dollar.Source: New York TimesIn Budget Logs It Tried to Hide, White House Wrests More Control Over SpendingWhat Happened: Newly released budget logs show Trump\u2019s OMB, led by Russell Vought, seizing control over billions Congress had appropriated for health, education, housing, and foreign aid. Political appointees quietly inserted conditions into more than 100 budget accounts, effectively blocking or delaying funds unless agencies prove they align with Trump\u2019s priorities.Why It Matters: This is a constitutional power grab. Trump is undermining Congress\u2019s power of the purse, choking off programs from energy aid for poor families to global health, and funneling the budget process through his political agenda. Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump revokes Kamala Harris' Secret Service detail extended by BidenWhat Happened: Trump ordered the Secret Service to end protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, overriding Biden\u2019s extension of her detail by one year. Harris\u2019 protection will end September 1, just eight months after leaving office, as Trump continues canceling security for Biden officials and critics.Why It Matters: Stripping protection from a recent vice president exposes Harris to potential danger. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader pattern of using security decisions as political punishment, undermining norms meant to safeguard former officials from threats.Source: ABC NewsSSA Whistleblower\u2019s Resignation Email Mysteriously Disappeared From InboxesWhat Happened: Chuck Borges, the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief data officer, resigned after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging that unauthorized DOGE operatives mishandled sensitive SSA data. Within 30 minutes, his resignation email disappeared from employee inboxes, raising suspicions of deliberate suppression.Why It Matters: The vanishing email suggests a cover-up of explosive claims that DOGE exposed millions of Americans\u2019 Social Security data to security risks and points to systemic violations of privacy laws.Source: WIREDEmil Bove Continued to Work at Justice Dept. After Judicial ConfirmationWhat Happened: Emil Bove, narrowly confirmed last month to a federal appeals court, has continued working at the Justice Department even after receiving his judicial commission. He attended DOJ events alongside Trump and Bondi and reportedly joined internal meetings, raising concerns he could influence cases that may later come before him.hy It Matters: A confirmed judge moonlighting at DOJ erases the line between an independent judiciary and a political enforcement arm. By staying inside the department, Bove shreds trust in judicial impartiality and shows how the regime is fusing courts with executive power.Source: New York TimesEPA fires employees who publicly criticized agency policies under TrumpWhat Happened: The EPA fired at least 8 employees who signed a letter criticizing Trump\u2019s environmental rollbacks under Administrator Lee Zeldin. More than 170 staff had joined the dissent, warning the agency was abandoning its mission to protect health and the environment. EPA leaders accused them of \u201csabotage,\u201d while the union called the firings retaliation and an assault on free speech and labor rights.Why It Matters: By silencing internal critics, Trump is accelerating the dismantling of environmental protections and eroding democratic norms. Science-driven governance is being replaced with loyalty tests and political obedience.Source: Associated PressSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsConservatives and economists warn Trump admin. against buying stakes in U.S. companies beyond IntelWhat Happened: After taking a 10% stake in Intel, Trump officials floated expanding government ownership to other U.S. companies. Critics blasted the move as state capitalism, warning it fuels cronyism and puts taxpayers on the hook. Intel, which got $11 billion in federal support but failed its benchmarks, had them waived by Trump.Why It Matters: Trump is breaking with free-market tradition, turning the government into a shareholder that rewards loyalty over innovation. It\u2019s state capitalism straight out of Russia.Source: CBS News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsDetainees report alleged uprising at \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019: \u2018A lot of people have bled\u2019What Happened: Migrants at Florida\u2019s Everglades internment camp say guards beat detainees with batons and fired teargas during protests, leaving \u201ca lot of people\u201d bloodied. Officials denied the reports as fabricated, even as abuse and hunger strikes at the camp continue.Why It Matters: The crackdown shows Trump\u2019s detention system is operating like an authoritarian prison camp \u2014 caging immigrants in brutal conditions and beating them into silence. Even after a judge ordered the site shut, Trump is racing to expand copycat jails with mocking names like \u201cDeportation Depot,\u201d echoing the cruelty of regimes America once condemned.Source: The GuardianFeds charge man who burned U.S. flag outside White House in protest of Trump's executive orderWhat Happened: Federal prosecutors charged a veteran who burned a U.S. flag outside the White House in protest of Trump\u2019s new executive order targeting flag burning. The charges\u2014framed as fire safety violations\u2014follow Trump\u2019s directive to DOJ to find ways around the Supreme Court\u2019s 1989 ruling that protects flag burning as free speech.Why It Matters: Trump is using executive power to criminalize constitutionally protected dissent. By reframing protest as a prosecutable offense, he\u2019s testing the limits of the First Amendment and laying the groundwork to erode core civil liberties.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFEMA\u2019s Chaotic Summer Has Gone From Bad to WorseWhat Happened: Kristi Noem ordered FEMA employees to publicly praise Trump\u2019s leadership even as the agency reels from mass resignations, contract delays, and disaster mismanagement. More than 190 staff signed a letter blasting the agency\u2019s dysfunction; dozens were swiftly placed on leave in what workers call retaliation.Why It Matters: FEMA is crippled as peak hurricane season begins. Instead of fixing bottlenecks and restoring trust, the regime is silencing whistleblowers and demanding loyalty oaths. The result: stalled disaster funds, gutted expertise, and Americans left exposed to catastrophe.Source: WIREDUS Homeland Security chief reports breach at FEMA, fires 23 employeesWhat Happened: Kristi Noem announced an IT breach at FEMA, blaming staff and purging 23 employees. While she claimed no sensitive citizen data was stolen, she accused FEMA\u2019s IT team of \u201cfailure\u201d and \u201cincompetence.\u201d The news comes amid Trump\u2019s push to dismantle FEMA, which is already under a hiring freeze.Why It Matters: Purging FEMA staff in the middle of hurricane season cripples America\u2019s disaster response capacity. By gutting the agency under political pretexts, Trump and Noem are leaving millions exposed to storms, floods, and fires with fewer resources and less expertise to respond.Source: ReutersFormer FEMA leaders have a warning: Lessons from Katrina are being forgotten under TrumpWhat Happened: Ex-FEMA leaders from both parties warn Trump\u2019s plan to dismantle the agency and dump disaster response on states is wiping out two decades of progress since Katrina. They say morale is collapsing, leadership is unqualified, and old red tape is back \u2014 the same failures that fueled the 2005 catastrophe.Why It Matters: FEMA reforms after Katrina were built to stop deadly delays. Trump is tearing them down, leaving the U.S. exposed as climate disasters intensify. Past administrators warn he\u2019s discarding hard-won lessons for politics, risking another Katrina-scale failure.Source: CNNVaccine disputes and agency departures put U.S. at risk, a former CDC official saysWhat Happened: RFK Jr. purged CDC Director Susan Monarez after less than a month on the job, prompting several top officials to resign. Former Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat warned that politicized vaccine decisions and the loss of experienced leaders leave the U.S. \u201creally at risk\u201d during future health crises.Why It Matters: Trump is sidelining science and stacking CDC panels with loyalists to predetermine outcomes on vaccines. That guts programs like Vaccines for Children, erodes trust in public health, and leaves Americans exposed to preventable outbreaks.Source: NPRNumber of Meteorologists at F.A.A. Is Critically Low, a Federal Watchdog WarnsWhat Happened: A GAO report warns the number of aviation meteorologists working with the FAA has fallen to a \u201ccritical low.\u201d Just 69 are on staff, down from 90 under a 2016 agreement, leaving fewer than half of U.S. control centers fully covered \u2014 with some of the busiest hubs staffed by only one or two.Why It Matters: These specialists are essential for keeping planes away from dangerous storms. With staff shortages and Trump\u2019s cuts straining the system, air safety is at risk as overworked meteorologists face burnout and the FAA has no plan to address the danger.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchWhat to Know About the US Warships Sent to South America and the Reaction in VenezuelaWhat Happened: The U.S. sent Aegis destroyers and amphibious assault ships with 4,000 sailors and Marines to waters near Venezuela, framing the move as part of Trump\u2019s war on \u201cdrug cartels.\u201d The show of force has fueled speculation of an invasion, which U.S. officials deny, while Nicol\u00e1s Maduro calls the deployment a hostile provocation and urges Venezuelans to enlist in militias.Why It Matters: Trump is using the Navy to rattle Maduro, cloaking regime-change pressure in anti-drug propaganda. The buildup heightens instability in Venezuela and stirs invasion fears across the region.Source: Military.com Norway seeks to defuse clash with Trump ally over fund's Caterpillar exitWhat Happened: Norway\u2019s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund dumped Caterpillar shares over ethical concerns tied to Israel\u2019s occupation. Sen. Lindsey Graham lashed out, threatening tariffs and visa bans, forcing Norway\u2019s prime minister to stress the decision wasn\u2019t political.Why It Matters: Trump allies are weaponizing trade to carry out their political objectives, using tariffs and threats to punish critics. With over $1 trillion of Norwegian assets in America, the clash risks politicizing global investment and destabilizing financial flows.Source: ReutersTrump Administration Bars Palestinian Officials From U.N. Meeting in New YorkWhat Happened: Marco Rubio announced Palestinian Authority and P.L.O. officials will be denied visas to attend next month\u2019s U.N. General Assembly in New York. The move comes as France, Canada, and potentially Britain prepare to recognize a Palestinian state, marking a major diplomatic shift.Why It Matters: The U.S. is breaking precedent by blocking Palestinian participation at the U.N., undermining the headquarters agreement that guarantees access. It\u2019s a clear effort to silence debate on Palestinian statehood and tilt diplomacy firmly in Israel\u2019s favor.Source: New York TimesXi Prepares Meeting of Security Bloc to Rival US-Led World OrderWhat Happened: Xi Jinping will host a major Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, uniting leaders from Russia, India, Pakistan, Iran, and others to approve a 10-year plan. The gathering will spotlight China\u2019s push to build a counterweight to NATO and U.S. alliances.Why It Matters: Even with internal rifts, the summit marks a coordinated challenge to America\u2019s order \u2014 and Trump\u2019s tariffs and fractured alliances are handing Russia and China a strategic win.Source: Bloomberg News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchMerz, Macron Push for Secondary Sanctions on Russian BackersWhat Happened: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron urged secondary sanctions on companies in third countries that help bankroll Russia\u2019s genocidal war. Their joint push targets Moscow\u2019s oil revenues and pressures Trump to align with Europe\u2019s expanded sanctions strategy.Why It Matters: Europe\u2019s biggest powers are losing patience with Trump\u2019s reluctance to confront Putin. By escalating sanctions and pledging Ukraine new security guarantees, Paris and Berlin aim to choke Russia\u2019s war economy.Source: Bloomberg NewsWhen the Kremlin Failed to Brainwash Them as Children, They Plotted Their EscapeWhat Happened: Despite years of Russian indoctrination in occupied Ukraine, dozens of young people have resisted propaganda and fled to Kyiv-controlled territory. Raised to believe Ukraine didn\u2019t exist, many secretly learned the truth online, saved money, and risked perilous escapes once they turned 18.Why It Matters: Russia has tried to erase Ukrainian identity in occupied regions by rewriting history and glorifying Moscow\u2019s rule. These escapes show the Kremlin\u2019s brainwashing campaign is failing\u2014Ukrainian identity endures, even among those raised under occupation, fueling resilience in the face of Russia\u2019s genocidal aggression.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn News\"De minimis\" U.S. tariffs exemption ends for low-value importsWhat Happened: Trump ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, which allowed parcels under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free. Why It Matters: Ending the exemption is a populist trade war move that shifts costs onto U.S. consumers. Framed as cracking down on China and drugs, it means higher prices on everyday goods.Source: CBS NewsWhen Mailing a Letter to the U.S. Becomes a Global HeadacheWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s rule ending duty exemptions for imports under $800 has led postal services worldwide to suspend shipments to the U.S. Ordinary letters, gifts, and small packages are caught in the chaos, forcing senders to rely on costly couriers like UPS and FedEx.Why It Matters: The policy has blindsided ordinary people and small businesses abroad. From driver\u2019s license renewals to Christmas gifts, everyday mail is snarled\u2014showing how Trump\u2019s tariff war is rippling into daily life worldwide.Source: New York Times\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/6- Next Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Appeals court finds Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs unconstitutional but leaves them in place for nowWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled that Trump had no legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs under emergency powers, calling his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d levies unconstitutional. But in a 7\u20134 decision, the court let the tariffs stay while Trump appeals to the Supreme Court.Source: Associated PressAppeals court blocks Trump administration from ending legal protections for 600,000 VenezuelansWhat Happened: A federal appeals court stopped Trump\u2019s bid to terminate Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans, ruling that DHS lacked authority to override prior extensions. The panel found Congress designed TPS to be shielded from politics, siding with plaintiffs who argued the rollback was unlawful and discriminatory.Source: CBS NewsLisa Cook begins court fight to keep her job at the FedWhat Happened: Lisa Cook is in court challenging Trump\u2019s attempt to fire her over unsubstantiated mortgage fraud claims pushed by a political appointee. A federal judge heard arguments Friday but did not rule on Cook\u2019s request for an emergency order blocking her removal. Cook\u2019s lawyers call the allegations a smear campaign meant to give Trump a majority on the Fed.Source: NBC NewsJudge blocks enforcement of Texas law restricting DEI and ESG adviceWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Texas from enforcing a new law that restricted proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS from giving guidance on DEI and environmental, social, and governance issues. The firms argued the law violated their First Amendment rights, and the court agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction against Attorney General Ken Paxton.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers9/6 \u2014 Next Day of Action8 \u2014 EPA employees purged for criticizing Trump\u2019s environmental rollbacks10% \u2014 Stake Trump officials took in Intel, with talk of expanding government ownership to other U.S. firms190+ \u2014 FEMA staff who signed a dissent letter; dozens placed on leave in retaliation23 \u2014 FEMA employees purged after Kristi Noem blamed them for an IT breach69 \u2014 Aviation meteorologists still working at the FAA, down from 90 under a 2016 agreement \u2014 a \u201ccritical low\u201d per GAO watchdog$4.9 billion \u2014 Foreign aid clawed back by Trump in a single \u201cpocket rescission\u201d2,400 \u2014 CDC employees purged under RFK Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d push600 \u2014 Military lawyers Trump plans to deploy as immigration judges100+ \u2014 Budget accounts Trump\u2019s OMB altered with political conditions$2 trillion \u2014 Size of Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund caught in Caterpillar clash\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?Trump\u2019s ICE is disappearing American citizens \u2014 How far will the regime be allowed to go in bypassing due process and constitutional protections?Trump is moving to seize the Fed \u2014 Will he succeed in packing it with loyalists before Powell\u2019s exit \u2014 and how will markets react if independence collapses?FEMA is being hollowed out \u2014 Will climate-driven disasters expose the dangers of dismantling federal response capacity?State sovereignty is under attack \u2014 Will Democratic governors block Trump in court, or will he succeed in deploying Guard troops to cities over their objections?Europe is escalating pressure on Russia \u2014 Can Paris and Berlin force Trump\u2019s hand on tougher sanctions, or will the U.S. fracture further from its allies?Immigration courts are being politicized \u2014 Will inexperienced loyalist judges erode due process, or can lawsuits slow Trump\u2019s judicial takeover?Trump\u2019s trade wars are spreading pain \u2014 Will rising costs on basics like food and household items finally trigger a backlash from Americans?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.Institutional Capture \u2014 From the Fed to the CDC to the Surface Transportation Board, Trump is purging independent experts and replacing them with loyalists, collapsing checks on executive power.Militarization of Governance \u2014 Immigration courts, ICE raids, and even disaster response are being militarized, blurring lines between civilian authority and armed forces.Erosion of Rights \u2014 From flag-burning prosecutions to trans student crackdowns, Trump is weaponizing law to silence dissent and roll back civil liberties.Authoritarian Budgets \u2014 By hijacking OMB and clawing back funds, Trump is seizing Congress\u2019s power of the purse and centralizing financial control in the White House.Geopolitical Fallout \u2014 Trump\u2019s tariffs and erratic diplomacy are fracturing alliances, handing wins to Russia and China as they consolidate blocs against the U.S.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Lawmakers from both parties blasted the move as unlawful, with Sen. Susan Collins warning it violates Congress\\u2019s constitutional power of the purse.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly defying Congress to gut foreign aid, breaking decades of precedent and edging toward one-man rule over federal spending.

Cook\\u2019s attorneys argued the firing was politically motivated, tied to Trump\\u2019s push to force the Fed to cut interest rates.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The case will decide whether the Fed remains independent or becomes a White House tool.

Political appointees quietly inserted conditions into more than 100 budget accounts, effectively blocking or delaying funds unless agencies prove they align with Trump\\u2019s priorities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a constitutional power grab.
