Most pardons bypass DOJ review and often go to allies and donors.Why It Matters: This \"Wild West\" pardon economy deepens a two-tier justice system where wealth buys freedom. This erodes public trust and turns presidential clemency into a transactional favor.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Taps Palantir to Compile Data on AmericansWhat Happened: Trump expanded Palantir\u2019s role across federal agencies to merge data on Americans into a centralized system. The company\u2019s Foundry platform is being used at DHS, HHS, and the IRS, with talks underway at the SSA and the Education Department. Why It Matters: The centralized system could be weaponized to build target lists, punish dissent, and cement authoritarian control\u2014mirroring tactics used in Russia.Source: New York TimesI covered this in more depth in a recent article.Unmasking RussiaThe Authoritarian Playbook: DOGE, Surveillance, and the Collapse of DemocracyIt has been a long 86 days\u2014 and feels like a decade\u2014since Trump returned to power.

The rule applies retroactively, threatening to void existing court orders that limit Trump\u2019s executive power.Why It Matters: Legal experts say this strips courts of the power to hold the government accountable. It would allow Trump officials to ignore court rulings with no consequences, undermining judicial authority and leaving Americans defenseless when federal agencies break the law.

Federal employees across at least six agencies say DOGE activity is ramping up, with new operatives, surprise purges, and aggressive contract cuts.Why It Matters: Musk is dismantling federal programs while building a surveillance machine. Loyalists are embedded, workers are purged, and DOGE is screening new hires for allegiance. Source: WIREDWhite House budget office rebukes watchdog over \u2018invasive\u2019 probesWhat Happened: The Trump White House budget office attacked the Government Accountability Office for its investigations into unilateral spending cuts, including the cancellation of a $5 billion EV program. OMB\u2019s top lawyer called the probes \u201cinvasive\u201d and said the office would limit cooperation moving forward.Why It Matters: This escalates a constitutional showdown. The GAO says only Congress controls the purse\u2014but Trump is defying that, grabbing power, and ignoring the law.Source: Washington PostTrump says he fired museum director as his budget targets SmithsonianWhat Happened: Trump announced he fired National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet for being \u201chighly partisan\u201d and backing DEI initiatives. He also proposed a 12% budget cut to the Smithsonian and defunded its Anacostia and Latino museums. But legal experts say he likely doesn\u2019t have the authority to fire Sajet, as staffing is controlled by the Smithsonian, not the White House.Why It Matters: This is another attack on cultural institutions under the banner of \u201canti-woke\u201d politics. Trump\u2019s executive order to purge \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d threatens the independence of the Smithsonian and targets efforts to diversify U.S. history and art.Source: The Washington PostTrump nominates former podcast host with history of inflammatory comments for top ethics jobWhat Happened: Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia\u2014a far-right former podcaster who praised Andrew Tate and called Jan. 6 a \u201cnational holiday\u201d\u2014to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, the federal agency meant to protect whistleblowers and enforce ethics laws.Why It Matters: Ingrassia\u2019s far-right views and loyalty to Trump will turn a neutral oversight office into a partisan weapon. His nomination, after Trump purged the previous watchdog, is part of an aggressive dismantling of oversight and accountability across the government.Source: NBC News\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsThe State Department Published A Substack Manifesto On \u2018Western Civilizational Heritage\u2019What Happened: A top Trump State Department official posted a manifesto on Substack urging the U.S. and Europe to defend \u201cWestern heritage\u201d from \u201cmass migration\u201d and \u201cdigital censorship.\u201d The essay echoed white nationalist rhetoric and praised far-right parties like AfD and Le Pen\u2019s National Rally.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s State Department is now a platform for extremist alt-right and white nationalist ideology. Racist, anti-immigrant agendas are being pushed through official channels, with a reorganization underway to hardwire these views into U.S. foreign policy.Source: TPMHomeland Security Cops Invade NY Congressman\u2019s Office, Handcuff AideWhat Happened: DHS agents stormed Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s Manhattan office, handcuffed a staffer, and accused them of \u201charboring rioters\u201d after immigration advocates were let in to escape ICE threats. The confrontation, caught on video, follows the arrest of Newark\u2019s mayor and highlights an escalation of federal intimidation tactics.Why It Matters: DHS agents storming a congressman\u2019s office is authoritarian thuggery\u2014something you expect in Russia, not the U.S. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s broader campaign to crush dissent, intimidate opponents, and normalize police-state tactics.Source: Mother JonesTrump intensifies vetting for all visas linked to HarvardWhat Happened: Trump ordered intense visa vetting for anyone affiliated with Harvard\u2014students, staff, speakers, even tourists. The policy includes full social media checks and flags private accounts as suspicious.Why It Matters: This is more political revenge, as Trump continues to punish Harvard for challenging him in court. It\u2019s a direct attack on academic freedom that threatens to gut international education, intimidate other universities, and turn visas into weapons of control.Source: The Washington PostState Dept. Launches \u201cRemigration\u201d Office to Advance Trump Deportation AgendaWhat Happened: The State Department is replacing its refugee bureau with an \u201cOffice of Remigration\u201d to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda. The plan slashes 300 offices and purges over 3,400 jobs, gutting refugee support in favor of expulsion.Why It Matters: This is yet another sign that Trump is embedding white nationalist ideology into official policy. Extremist far-right groups use the term \u201cremigration\u201d as coded language for ethnic cleansing. Now, Trump wants to institutionalize it through a federal office that will work with DHS to carry it out.Source: The GuardianTrump Tyranny Tracker is a reader-supported publication.

The order came after VA doctors warned in The New England Journal of Medicine that staff purges threatened care for veterans exposed to toxins. Internal emails reveal political aides quickly moved to clamp down, citing potential \u201cnegative national exposure.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is another attack on science and free speech, and a classic authoritarian tactic. By censoring medical experts, Trump is putting veterans at risk and turning the VA into a propaganda arm.Source: The GuardianUnions representing Harvard workers fear Trump\u2019s \u2018authoritarian turn\u2019What Happened: Trump is trying to block Harvard from enrolling international students, also putting scholars and workers at risk. A judge has temporarily halted the move, but the chilling effect is already being felt.Why It Matters: This is another crackdown on immigrants, labor, and academic freedom. Visas are disappearing, scientists are silencing themselves, and the message is clear that dissent will be punished.Source: The GuardianPBS Sues Trump Over Defunding Order, Days After NPRWhat Happened: PBS filed a federal lawsuit against Trump, accusing him of \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d for cutting public funding over perceived bias. The move follows NPR\u2019s legal challenge earlier this week. PBS says that the cuts endanger educational shows, rural journalism, and vital emergency broadcasts.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing executive power to silence independent media, threatening trusted public services that millions rely on, especially in rural and underserved communities.Source: Associated PressAs Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger retires, he's concerned about spike in threats against lawmakersWhat Happened: Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger retired Friday, warning that threats against lawmakers have surged to 10,000 a year\u2014ten times higher than in 2017. He said the force is now stretched thin investigating threats nationwide. His final ask was a $1 billion budget for 2026.Why It Matters: Political violence is surging\u2014fueled by MAGA rhetoric and extremism\u2014and lawmakers and their families are in the crosshairs. Manger\u2019s warning is stark: the threat is national and accelerating. If Congress fails to act, it becomes complicit in the danger.Source: CBS NewsArmy says Trump's military parade could cause $16 million in damage to Washington streetsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s military parade is scheduled for June 14\u2014his 79th birthday and the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary. It will include tanks, helicopters, and 9,000 troops, with a projected cost of $45 million and up to $16 million for street damage.Why It Matters: It\u2019s an authoritarian-style spectacle that misuses military power for Trump\u2019s personal glorification. The event\u2019s cost and infrastructure damage come as federal programs face deep cuts, grants are gutted, and federal workers are purged.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsImmigration arrests in courthouses have become the new deportation tool, stripping migrants of a legal processWhat Happened: ICE agents have shifted to a new tactic and are arresting immigrants in courthouses\u2014often after their cases are dismissed\u2014bypassing due process. Why It Matters: DHS is carrying out mass deportation dragnets targeting immigrants who are complying with the legal system. These courthouse arrests undermine the legal system and strip migrants of basic rights. Advocates say this transforms legal pathways into traps, endangering families and weaponizing the courts for mass removals.Source: NBC NewsTrump Officials Knew Vast Majority of Venezuelans Sent to Salvadoran Prison Had Not Been Convicted of U.S. CrimesWhat Happened: Trump disappeared 238 Venezuelan men to a Salvadoran gulag using the Alien Enemies Act, labeling them \u201cgang members\u201d or \u201cterrorists.\u201d But DHS data shows only 32 had U.S. convictions, mostly minor, and over 130 had no criminal record. Many were asylum seekers targeted for tattoos.Why It Matters: This is more evidence that due process was erased and asylum cases ignored. With no real ties to gangs or Maduro, advocates say the disappearances were illegal and abusive.Source: ProPublicaA Missouri Town Was Solidly Behind Trump. Then Carol Was Detained.What Happened: Ming Li Hui\u2014known as Carol to residents of Kennett, Missouri\u2014was detained by ICE on April 30 and faces deportation to Hong Kong after 20 years in the U.S. Carol had no criminal record, worked multiple jobs, raised a family, and was embraced by her conservative community.Why It Matters: Trump won 80% of the vote in Kennett. Now, his deportation policy is directly impacting the neighbors whom many locals love and support. The community is divided\u2014some rally for Carol\u2019s release, while others back Trump\u2019s hardline approach. Her detention reveals the real-life consequences of Trump\u2019s cruel deportation push.Source: New York TimesFlock Backs Off Using Hacked Data in People Search Tool After BacklashWhat Happened: After backlash from employees and reporting by 404 Media, surveillance firm Flock dropped plans to use hacked data in its new tool, Nova, which links license plate scans to public records. Earlier drafts considered breached data like the Park Mobile hack.Why It Matters: This rare reversal shows growing resistance to unchecked surveillance. Public pressure forced Flock to walk back its most dystopian features, though the company still fuels expansive police data-sharing nationwide.Source: 404 MediaSupreme Court allows Trump to begin removing 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and VenezuelaWhat Happened: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Trump, allowing it to end humanitarian parole for over 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The move clears the way for mass deportations, despite ongoing legal challenges.Why It Matters: This accelerates one of Trump\u2019s largest deportation efforts\u2014targeting migrants fleeing authoritarian regimes. Critics say it violates due process and humanitarian norms. Justices Jackson and Sotomayor dissented, warning of devastating harm. Source: ABC NewsArmy document outlines plans for expelling transgender troops from militaryWhat Happened: The Army ordered transgender troops to leave by June 6 or face forced removal, using Trump\u2019s executive order to justify expulsion under \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. Soldiers will be misgendered, flagged in records, and discharged with codes that may block future security clearances.Why It Matters: This is a targeted purge of transgender troops under the false guise of \u201cnational security.\u201d It strips them of dignity, ends their service, and brands them in ways that threaten future jobs, safety, and basic civil rights.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDeep cuts erode the foundations of US public health system, end progress, threaten worse to comeWhat Happened: Trump cut $11 billion in public health funding, purged 20,000 federal workers, and ended key programs for vaccinations, outbreak tracking, and mobile clinics. The move has gutted local health departments nationwide.Why It Matters: As measles, whooping cough, and bird flu threats rise, the U.S. is dismantling the infrastructure meant to prevent outbreaks. Experts warn these cuts risk lives and are an intentional war on public health.Source: Associated PressCDC removes language that says healthy kids and pregnant women should get COVID shotsWhat Happened: The CDC quietly downgraded its COVID vaccine guidance, now saying healthy children and pregnant women may get vaccinated\u2014no longer recommending it. The change came after RFK Jr. announced the shift, sidestepping the CDC scientific review.Why It Matters: Experts warn it will sow confusion, lower vaccination rates, erode trust in public health, and endanger lives.Source: Associated PressTrump cuts threaten safety training for America\u2019s most dangerous jobsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s deep cuts to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are forcing safety programs for fishermen, farmers, and loggers to shut down. Nearly 900 NIOSH staff were purged in April, and key training centers say they\u2019ll run out of funds by summer or fall.Why It Matters: These industries have fatality rates seven times the national average. Without federally funded safety training, workers in high-risk, rural jobs will be more vulnerable to deadly accidents, addiction, and mental health issues. Source: ReutersShort-staffed NWS enters hurricane season in \"uncharted territory.\" Meteorologists share their concerns.What Happened: The National Weather Service has purged over 10% of its workforce\u2014about 550 staff\u2014 just as the 2025 hurricane season begins. Key forecast offices and the National Hurricane Center are critically understaffed.Why It Matters: With a busier-than-normal hurricane season expected, experts warn these cuts will put lives at risk. Forecasts may be inaccurate, and staff shortages are straining the system nationwide, leaving parts of the country dangerously exposed.Source: CBS NewsThe Department of Energy axes $3.7 billion in clean energy project grantsWhat Happened: Energy Secretary Chris Wright cut $3.7 billion in clean energy grants, gutting 24 major projects focused on carbon capture, cleaner cement, and low-emission tech. Most were awarded under Biden\u2019s final months and funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. Why It Matters: This is another Trump assault on U.S. climate progress, domestic manufacturing, and clean tech jobs. It will raise energy costs, kill union jobs, and hand global clean energy leadership to China\u2014all to appease Big Oil.Source: Associated PressMedicaid Cuts Could Force More Kids Into Caregiver RolesWhat Happened: As Trump pushes deep Medicaid cuts, experts warn millions more children may be forced to become unpaid caregivers. Programs that fund in-home care are on the chopping block, and without that support, students are left juggling caregiving, school, and work.Why It Matters: Cuts to home and community-based services mean kids will have to step in. Studies show young caregivers suffer academically and emotionally. The cuts will disproportionately affect Black, Hispanic, and Asian students. Source: CBS NewsTrump ending multiple HIV vaccine studies, scientists and officials sayWhat Happened: Trump has cut funding for key HIV vaccine programs, including efforts at Duke and Scripps, saying current treatments are sufficient. NIH officials confirmed the shutdown will halt most new research, citing a budget rule change that blocks multi-year grants.Why It Matters: Scientists warn this will delay HIV vaccine progress by a decade. While prevention drugs like lenacapavir show promise, researchers say a vaccine is still essential to end the global epidemic.Source: CBS News\u2018Going to increase prices on everybody\u2019: US energy department workers sound alarm over cutsWhat Happened: Department of Energy workers say Trump\u2019s $19.3 billion in budget cuts and deregulation will spike household energy costs, slash innovation, and dismantle efficiency programs. Thousands have already left or been forced out, and 47 energy standards are being eliminated.Why It Matters: Experts warn the rollback will cost families and cripple U.S. competitiveness. Internal morale has plummeted amid purges, and clean energy research is collapsing just as demand surges.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchUnder Trump, State Department questions Europe\u2019s commitment to \u201cdemocracy\u201dWhat Happened: Trump is accusing key European allies of \u201cfree speech backsliding\u201d and plans to impose visa bans on officials tied to online content moderation. A new \u201cOffice of Natural Rights\u201d is being created to push this line, while Trump praises far-right leaders like Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orb\u00e1n.Why It Matters: Trump continues turning U.S. policy against liberal democracies while aligning with autocrats. By threatening visa bans over content moderation and praising far-right extremist leaders, he\u2019s again undermining allies and promoting an authoritarian agenda.Source: Washington Post\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence Watch'Russian Bombers Are Burning En Masse' \u2014 Ukraine Hits 41 Planes in Deep StrikeWhat Happened: Ukraine\u2019s SBU carried out a long-range drone strike deep into Russia\u2014codenamed Spiderweb\u2014hitting five airbases and disabling or destroying 41 strategic bombers, including A-50s, Tu-95s, and Tu-22M3s. \"The SBU first transported FPV drones to Russia, and later, on the territory of the Russian Federation, the drones were hidden under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins, already placed on trucks.\u201d Why It Matters: The strike cripples 34% of Russia\u2019s cruise missile fleet and inflicts $7 billion in damage. It destroys the myth that Russia is untouchable\u2014and rewrites the rules of modern long-range warfare.Source: The Kyiv IndependentCPAC Expands to Europe as Trump Aligns with Far-Right LeadersWhat Happened: MAGA leaders and far-right politicians gathered at CPAC events in Poland and Hungary, strengthening ties between Trump\u2019s White House and Europe\u2019s authoritarian right. Trump praised Viktor Orb\u00e1n in a video address, while Kristi Noem campaigned for Poland\u2019s far-right presidential candidate. Orb\u00e1n called Trump\u2019s return a \u201ctsunami\u201d for global conservatism.Why It Matters: Trump is openly aligning with authoritarian regimes and meddling in European elections. CPAC\u2019s global push continues exporting MAGA politics abroad\u2014undermining democratic norms and threatening the transatlantic alliance.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsA New \u2018Revenge Tax\u2019 Aimed at Foreign Investors Is Rattling Wall StreetWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax bill includes a new \u201cSection 899\u201d provision allowing the U.S. to impose retaliatory taxes of up to 20% on foreign investors, governments, and companies if their countries are deemed to be taxing U.S. firms unfairly, especially in tech.Why It Matters: Analysts warn the tax could spark a \u201ccapital war,\u201d discourage foreign investment, and further shake U.S. markets. Critics argue it risks long-term damage to America's financial standing.Source: Wall Street JournalWall Street Warns Trump Tax Plan Could Rattle Bond MarketsWhat Happened: Top bankers have privately warned Trump aides that the GOP\u2019s $2.3 trillion tax bill\u2014set to extend 2017 cuts and boost military and immigration spending\u2014could destabilize the bond market and spike interest rates. Treasury yields have already jumped past 5%, and fears are mounting that U.S. debt will become harder and costlier to finance.Why It Matters: As deficits soar and borrowing costs rise, investor confidence in U.S. fiscal stability is wavering. Source: Washington PostTrump says he plans to double steel, aluminum tariffs to 50%What Happened: Trump announced a 50% tariff on imported steel and aluminum, up from 25%, set to take effect June 4. Why It Matters: This escalation deepens Trump\u2019s global trade war and threatens cross-border supply chains. Allies like Canada, the EU, and Australia condemned the hike and warned of retaliation. Experts say the tariffs will raise prices, disrupt industries, and fuel more global economic instability.Source: ReutersU.S. Consumer Spending Slows as Tariff Chaos and Uncertainty Take HoldWhat Happened: Consumer spending rose just 0.2% in April as Americans pulled back and saved more amid growing economic uncertainty. Personal income rose 0.8%, with core PCE up just 2.5% year-over-year\u2014the slowest pace in four years. Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs and trade policy shifts are distorting the economy, complicating forecasts, and delaying Fed rate cuts.Why It Matters: Consumers are tightening their wallets and imports are slowing down under Trump\u2019s tariff regime. But experts warn it\u2019s the \u201ccalm before the storm,\u201d with delayed inflation and reduced inventories likely to shake the economy later this year.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans Unite on June 6th in D.C.\u2018We All Are Going to Die\u2019: Sen.
