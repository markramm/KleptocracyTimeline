This marks the third delay, despite the U.S. Supreme Court upholding a Biden-era law requiring the app\u2019s divestment or ban over national security concerns.Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying the law\u2014and it barely registers in the news. He\u2019s protecting a platform linked to China to court young voters, even as he claims to be tough on Beijing. Once again, he puts personal gain over national security, aiding a foreign adversary to boost his political standing.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsDemocrats Say Trump Is Weaponizing Law Enforcement to Silence FoesWhat Happened: Congressional Democrats are accusing Trump of using federal law enforcement to intimidate and silence political opponents, activists, and critics. The accusations follow a string of high-profile arrests, raids, and investigations targeting progressive organizations, Democratic officials, and immigrant advocacy groups.Why It Matters: This is textbook authoritarianism. Trump is weaponizing the justice system to try and crush dissent and punish his enemies. The rule of law is being twisted into a tool for revenge.Source: CBS NewsTrump using National Guard for deportation work could go into 'uncharted territory'What Happened: Trump is weighing a plan to deploy 20,000 National Guard troops\u2014under red-state control\u2014for immigration crackdowns in blue states, even without their consent. The troops would operate under ICE\u2019s 287(g) framework, reviving tactics previously ended due to racial profiling. Legal experts call this an unprecedented use of state militias across state lines.Why It Matters: This would shatter the balance between state and federal power. Deploying red-state troops into blue states without consent is provocation. If Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, it would clear the path for a full-blown military police state.Source: USA TodayDemocrats Raise War Powers Concerns as Trump Mulls Iran StrikeWhat Happened: Senate Democrats warn Trump is preparing to launch military strikes on Iran without congressional approval or credible intelligence. Sen. Tim Kaine is pushing a resolution to block unilateral action, while only one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, has backed a similar measure. Source: Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Allowed to Keep Using National Guard in LA for NowWhat Happened: A federal appeals court ruled that Trump can continue using California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to suppress protests while the legal challenge from Governor Gavin Newsom proceeds. The panel, which includes two Trump-appointed judges, sided with Trump\u2019s claim that he acted within his authority.Why It Matters: This ruling gives Trump a blank check to send troops into states against their will. It shreds federalism, sidelines governors, and opens the door to military crackdowns on protests. Source: BloombergTrump Threatens Troop Expansion After Court Victory Over CaliforniaWhat Happened: After a federal appeals court sided with Trump, allowing him to keep National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, Trump warned he may deploy troops to other Democrat-led cities if local police \u201ccan\u2019t get the job done.\u201dWhy It Matters: The ruling reinforces Trump\u2019s power to override state authority and militarize immigration enforcement. \u201cBIG WIN,\u201d he declared, turning the legal green light into a broader threat of federal force against dissent.Source: The New RepublicOutrage as DHS moves to restrict lawmaker visits to detention centersWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security issued new guidance requiring lawmakers to give 72 hours' notice before visiting immigration detention centers. Some ICE sites are now off-limits entirely, despite laws guaranteeing congressional access. Recent weeks have seen multiple Democratic lawmakers arrested, denied entry, or physically assaulted while attempting oversight visits.Why It Matters: DHS is blocking lawmakers from doing their jobs and hiding what\u2019s happening inside ICE detention centers. This is part of Trump\u2019s broader effort to strip rights from Democrats, silence oversight, and punish political opposition.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsMusk Calls Trump Adviser Sergio Gor a \u201cSnake\u201d Amid White House FeudWhat Happened: Musk publicly attacked top Trump adviser Sergio Gor, calling him a \u201csnake\u201d for allegedly sabotaging Musk\u2019s NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman. Musk\u2019s tirade followed a New York Post report\u2014almost certainly leaked by Musk\u2014claiming Gor failed to complete his security clearance. Why It Matters: This is Kremlin-style infighting, now unfolding in Trump\u2019s White House. Musk\u2019s attack on Gor exposes the fractures and dysfunction tearing through Trump\u2019s inner circle. In Russia, some of the dirtiest secrets come out when Kremlin insiders and oligarchs turn on each other.Source: PoliticoFrom yesterday\u2019s tracker\u2026Powerful Trump aide who\u2019s in charge of vetting thousands of staffers still hasn\u2019t been fully vetted himself: sourcesWhat Happened: Sergio Gor, Trump\u2019s personnel director in charge of vetting over 4,000 executive branch staffers, has not submitted the mandatory SF-86 form required for permanent security clearance, sources say. Despite holding an interim clearance and immense influence over appointments, Gor has resisted the process, citing distrust of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and the FBI.Why It Matters: Gor isn\u2019t even his real name, and he refused basic vetting. A Russian-born operative holds major power in Trump\u2019s government with no transparency or accountability. This is a massive national security failure.Source: New York Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsPregnant U.S. Citizen Detained by Border Patrol: 'We Didn\u2019t Do Anything Wrong'What Happened: Cary L\u00f3pez Alvarado, a nine-month pregnant U.S. citizen, was violently arrested by Border Patrol in Hawthorne, CA, while defending her boyfriend and cousin\u2014both Latino, one also a citizen. Agents chained her under her belly, reportedly assumed she was undocumented, and only released her after she complained of stomach pain. She gave birth days later. Her boyfriend, who has no criminal record, remains locked up in Texas.Why It Matters: This is what Trump\u2019s war on immigrants looks like\u2014indiscriminate, racist, and cruel. A pregnant American citizen was shackled and humiliated. The regime is erasing rights, one brutal raid at a time.Source: KTLARepublicans\u2019 Social Security Attacks Disproportionately Harm Retirees of ColorWhat Happened: Trump continues gutting Social Security\u2014closing field offices, cutting phone verification, and prepping mass purges\u2014 as Musk spread false claims about noncitizen fraud. The result? Millions of seniors, especially in poor or rural areas, will be forced to verify their identities in person, even if the nearest office is hours away.Why It Matters: Older Americans without internet, transportation, or savings will be pushed to the brink. One missed check can mean eviction, hunger, or worse. These barriers are a deliberate attack on the most vulnerable to dismantle the safety net piece by piece.Source: Mother JonesHegseth Orders 'Passive Approach' to Juneteenth as Trump Kills DEIWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth reportedly told Pentagon officials to take a \u201cpassive approach\u201d to Juneteenth, the federal holiday marking the end of slavery. The internal directive comes amid Trump\u2019s broader war on DEI, which Hegseth declared \u201cdead.\u201d Why It Matters: Erasing Juneteenth and gutting DEI is a deliberate attack on racial justice and historical truth. Trump is trying to rewrite what the military stands for, silencing progress and pushing a whitewashed agenda that distorts America\u2019s past.Source: The GuardianTensions Flare as Agents Arrest Another U.S. Citizen for \u201cInterfering\u201d in Immigration ArrestsWhat Happened: Adrian Martinez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was violently arrested by Border Patrol during an immigration raid in Pico Rivera. Video shows him defending a man being detained before agents tackled and dragged him into a truck. His arrest is one of several in L.A. where Latino U.S. citizens have been caught in sweeping federal raids.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s deportation machine continues targeting American citizens\u2014based on skin color and zip code. Racial profiling, constitutional abuse, and brute force are turning Latino neighborhoods into militarized zones.Source: Los Angeles Times\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchJustice Dept. to Cut Two-Thirds of Inspectors Monitoring Gun SalesWhat Happened: Trump is slashing 541 of the roughly 800 inspectors who monitor gun dealers, gutting the ATF\u2019s oversight capacity as part of a broader plan to weaken the agency and possibly merge it with the DEA. This follows the rollback of multiple Biden-era gun control rules and comes amid rising pressure to cut the ATF\u2019s budget by nearly a third.Why It Matters: This guts protections that keep guns out of the wrong hands. Trump is siding with shady dealers and the gun lobby over basic public safety. By slashing inspections, he\u2019s opening the floodgates for illegal sales\u2014and more deadly violence in our communities and schools.Source: New York TimesUS Wildfire Response Crippled by Trump Cuts, Say InsidersWhat Happened: As wildfire season ramps up, firefighters say the U.S. is dangerously exposed. Trump\u2019s purges and agency dismantling have hollowed out support staff, delayed pay and healthcare, and left crews under-equipped. His chaotic plan to merge fire agencies under a new Interior Department unit has sown confusion, while critical science and prevention funding have been slashed or frozen.Why It Matters: With record heat and dry conditions already fueling fires, the country is heading into crisis with weakened defenses. Trump\u2019s war on science and government is putting lives, homes, and entire communities at risk.Source: The GuardianNew Report Highlights Air Traffic Control Staffing WoesWhat Happened: A new Congressional report warns of dangerous staffing shortages in the FAA, blaming excessive overtime, burnout, and outdated training pipelines. While Trump\u2019s FAA bill includes $12.5 billion to fix it, the funding comes with steep cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and clean energy\u2014sparking fierce opposition from Democrats.Why It Matters: America\u2019s air traffic system is on the edge. Near-misses are up, crashes are rising, and exhausted controllers are being stretched to the limit. Fixing it shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of basic social safety nets.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchHow Netanyahu Pushed Trump Toward WarWhat Happened: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persuaded Trump to support a military strike on Iran after a failed diplomatic effort. Initially resistant, Trump changed course, and Israeli officials presented intelligence claiming Iran was secretly advancing its nuclear weapons program.Why It Matters: Netanyahu\u2019s maneuvering marks a pivotal shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump now backing war against Iran. Despite U.S. intelligence doubting Iran\u2019s political intent to build a bomb, Israel\u2019s influence set the stage for a regional war with unpredictable consequences.Source: TIMEIn Crisis With Iran, U.S. Military Officials Focus on Strait of HormuzWhat Happened: As Trump considers entering Israel\u2019s war with Iran, the Pentagon is preparing for Tehran to mine the Strait of Hormuz\u2014a chokepoint for 25% of global oil. Iran has done it before and retains the missiles, drones, and regional proxies to strike. Military officials warn U.S. forces could be directly targeted.Why It Matters: Blocking the strait would detonate a global energy crisis and drag the U.S. into another endless war. Trump is playing with fire with no strategy or plan.Source: New York TimesSpain Rejects Trump\u2019s NATO Spending Demands Ahead of SummitWhat Happened: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against Trump\u2019s demand that NATO countries rapidly meet higher defense spending targets, calling the request \u201cunreasonable\u201d and warning it could harm economic growth. The rejection has disrupted careful diplomatic planning ahead of the NATO summit.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s bullying is straining NATO from within. As Russia\u2019s genocidal war grinds on and Europe is under threat from further Russian aggression, his demands are straining unity and pushing allies like Spain to push back. Source: Associated PressTrying to Satisfy Trump, NATO Is Running Into DifficultiesWhat Happened: In a rush to placate Trump before next week\u2019s NATO summit, allies are inflating defense spending to hit his arbitrary 5% of GDP demand. NATO chief Mark Rutte is proposing creative accounting\u2014counting infrastructure, health spending, and Ukraine aid as \u201cmilitary-adjacent\u201d\u2014to make the numbers work, though there\u2019s no clear timeline or enforcement plan.Why It Matters: Trump is bullying NATO into flashy metrics while ignoring the alliance\u2019s actual defense needs. It\u2019s a dangerous charade that leaves Europe vulnerable\u2014and puts collective security at the mercy of Trump\u2019s ego.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchU.S. Pushing Allies to Limit Focus on Ukraine in NATO Summit CommuniqueWhat Happened: The U.S. is pressuring NATO allies to downplay Ukraine in next week\u2019s summit communique, pushing for only a brief mention of Kyiv\u2019s defense capabilities and excluding any broad statement of support. The current draft marks a sharp break from past summits, where NATO strongly backed Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia.Why It Matters: Trump continues weakening NATO and betraying Ukraine while cozying up to Putin. European officials see it for what it is: a gift to Moscow. Trump continues doing Russia\u2019s work for them.Source: NewsweekRogue states Russia and Iran attempting to destroy MAGA movement with disinformation bot armyWhat Happened: Russia and Iran are running tens of thousands of bots impersonating MAGA supporters to destabilize the movement from within, according to a new report. The bot network amplifies conspiracy narratives within right-wing spaces to spread confusion, attack Trump, and discredit U.S. institutions.Why It Matters: This information warfare operation mirrors identical tactics previously used against Democrats. \u201cIt destroyed the Democratic party, and now they are going after MAGA,\u201d one NCRI analyst warned.Source: New York PostArgentina Uncovers Russian Disinformation NetworkWhat Happened: Argentine authorities say they\u2019ve exposed a covert Russian spy operation known as \u201cThe Company,\u201d linked to Kremlin-run Project Lakhta. Led by Russian nationals Lev Andriashvili and Irina Yakovenko, the network allegedly funneled money, ran focus groups, and spread disinformation through civic groups and social media to manipulate public opinion and influence politics in Argentina.Why It Matters: Russia always does this\u2014it\u2019s baked into the Kremlin\u2019s playbook. For every influence operation exposed, hundreds more are already in motion. The goal is division, confusion, and chaos. By flooding democracies with disinformation, Russia destroys trust, tears societies apart, and buries the truth under a mountain of lies.Source:  Moscow TimesTrump\u2019s Base in Uproar Over His Openness to Joining Iran FightWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s openness to military action against Iran has triggered fierce backlash among his base. Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and others accuse Trump of betraying his isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d promise, while GOP hawks like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham push for full support of Israel\u2019s war, including U.S. bombers and joint strikes.Why It Matters: The MAGA base is fracturing. Trump is caught between his anti-war brand and the push for war with Iran. If he caves to hawks, he risks losing his core supporters. If he resists, he faces rebellion inside the GOP. Source: New York Times\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsChina Learned a Valuable Lesson in U.S. Trade Talks: The Value of Its LeverageWhat Happened: Despite Trump claiming victory in a new U.S.-China trade deal, Beijing emerged emboldened. The agreement mostly restores a prior truce, while leaving Trump\u2019s tariffs in place. China, however, has gained key concessions\u2014like access to U.S. markets for rare earths\u2014after strategically throttling exports and exploiting Trump\u2019s eagerness for a deal.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s bluster is masking a strategic loss. China is turning the trade war into a geopolitical advantage, weaponizing critical minerals and exposing Trump\u2019s volatility. Instead of weakening Beijing, this deal strengthens its hand.Source: CNNUS Consumers Grow More Pessimistic Amid Tariff-Driven Price FearsWhat Happened: A TransUnion survey found that 27% of Americans feel pessimistic about their finances, up from 21% last quarter. The spike in concern is closely tied to Trump\u2019s erratic tariffs, which are fueling fears of rising costs and economic instability.Why It Matters: Consumers are cutting back on spending and turning to credit, with inflation and recession fears reaching two-year highs. The findings signal weakening confidence and growing financial stress under Trump\u2019s economic policies.Source: ReutersTrump Is Driving Off Investors and Threatening the Dollar\u2019s ReignWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s return to power, the U.S. dollar has plunged over 10% against major currencies. Soaring deficits, tariff chaos, and Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on the Fed have spooked investors. Foreign creditors are taking hits, and hedge funds have stacked up $16 billion in bets against the dollar. Analysts warn the freefall isn\u2019t over.Why It Matters: The dollar is no longer the world\u2019s safe bet and is becoming a liability. Trump\u2019s erratic economic moves are driving the U.S. toward a self-inflicted debt crisis with global consequences. Source: BloombergSwiss Exports to U.S. Collapse as Shippers Wait for Tariff DealWhat Happened: Swiss exports to the U.S. plunged 42% in May as companies paused shipments, waiting for a new trade deal with Trump. The sharp drop pushed Switzerland\u2019s trade surplus to a five-year low, while U.S. exports to Switzerland rose 6.5%. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic tariff war is shaking global markets and straining relationships with key allies. The Swiss export collapse is a red flag\u2014proof that even stable, high-end economies are scrambling to shield themselves. If this continues, Trump\u2019s trade tactics could tip the world into a recession.Source: Bloomberg\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Dodgers Deny ICE Entry Amid Immigration Protests at StadiumWhat Happened: The Los Angeles Dodgers blocked federal immigration agents from accessing stadium grounds during an anti-ICE protest.

He\u2019s protecting a platform linked to China to court young voters, even as he claims to be tough on Beijing. Once again, he puts personal gain over national security, aiding a foreign adversary to boost his political standing.</span></p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><span> </span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/trump-extends-tiktok-ban-deadline-another-90-days-rcna213720\" rel=\"\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr/></div><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\"><strong>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation News</strong><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7in-power-consolidation-news\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/166339989/in-power-consolidation-news\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p></p><h3 class=\"header-anchor-post\">Democrats Say Trump Is Weaponizing Law Enforcement to Silence Foes<div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top\" id=\"\u00a7democrats-say-trump-is-weaponizing-law-enforcement-to-silence-foes\"></div><button aria-label=\"Link\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft iconButton-mq_Et5 iconButtonBase-dJGHgN buttonBase-GK1x3M buttonStyle-r7yGCK size_sm-G3LciD priority_secondary-S63h9o\" data-href=\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/i/166339989/democrats-say-trump-is-weaponizing-law-enforcement-to-silence-foes\" tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-link\" fill=\"none\" height=\"18\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"18\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71\"></path><path d=\"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71\"></path></svg></button></div></div></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong><span> Congressional Democrats are accusing Trump of using federal law enforcement to intimidate and silence political opponents, activists, and critics.

Every one of the stories in your tracker is highly disturbing and important that we know about. I want to see lawmakers investigating these ICE abuses. Who are these masked people?

This marks the third delay, despite the U.S. Supreme Court upholding a Biden-era law requiring the app\\u2019s divestment or ban over national security concerns.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly defying the law\\u2014and it barely registers in the news. He\\u2019s protecting a platform linked to China to court young voters, even as he claims to be tough on Beijing. Once again, he puts personal gain over national security, aiding a foreign adversary to boost his political standing.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/trump-extends-tiktok-ban-deadline-another-90-days-rcna213720\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Democrats Say Trump Is Weaponizing Law Enforcement to Silence Foes</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Congressional Democrats are accusing Trump of using federal law enforcement to intimidate and silence political opponents, activists, and critics. The accusations follow a string of high-profile arrests, raids, and investigations targeting progressive organizations, Democratic officials, and immigrant advocacy groups.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is textbook authoritarianism. Trump is weaponizing the justice system to try and crush dissent and punish his enemies. The rule of law is being twisted into a tool for revenge.</p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-trump-administration-weaponizing-law-enforcement-silence-political-foes/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump using National Guard for deportation work could go into 'uncharted territory'</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is weighing a plan to deploy 20,000 National Guard troops\\u2014under red-state control\\u2014for immigration crackdowns in blue states, even without their consent. The troops would operate under ICE\\u2019s 287(g) framework, reviving tactics previously ended due to racial profiling. Legal experts call this an unprecedented use of state militias across state lines.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This would shatter the balance between state and federal power. Deploying red-state troops into blue states without consent is provocation. If Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, it would clear the path for a full-blown military police state.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/06/19/trump-national-guard-immigration-enforcement-states/84190706007/\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Democrats Raise War Powers Concerns as Trump Mulls Iran Strike</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Senate Democrats warn Trump is preparing to launch military strikes on Iran without congressional approval or credible intelligence.

Thomas Massie, has backed a similar measure. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/19/congress-war-powers-military-iran-trump/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Allowed to Keep Using National Guard in LA for Now</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A federal appeals court ruled that Trump can continue using California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to suppress protests while the legal challenge from Governor Gavin Newsom proceeds. The panel, which includes two Trump-appointed judges, sided with Trump\\u2019s claim that he acted within his authority.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This ruling gives Trump a blank check to send troops into states against their will. It shreds federalism, sidelines governors, and opens the door to military crackdowns on protests. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/trump-can-keep-using-troops-in-la-for-now-appeals-court-says?srnd=phx-us-politics\\\\\\\">Bloomberg</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Threatens Troop Expansion After Court Victory Over California</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> After a federal appeals court sided with Trump, allowing him to keep National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, Trump warned he may deploy troops to other Democrat-led cities if local police \\u201Ccan\\u2019t get the job done.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The ruling reinforces Trump\\u2019s power to override state authority and militarize immigration enforcement. \\u201CBIG WIN,\\u201D he declared, turning the legal green light into a broader threat of federal force against dissent.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://newrepublic.com/post/197049/donald-trump-threatens-troops-more-cities\\\\\\\">The New Republic</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Outrage as DHS moves to restrict lawmaker visits to detention centers</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security issued new guidance requiring lawmakers to give 72 hours' notice before visiting immigration detention centers. Some ICE sites are now off-limits entirely, despite laws guaranteeing congressional access. Recent weeks have seen multiple Democratic lawmakers arrested, denied entry, or physically assaulted while attempting oversight visits.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> DHS is blocking lawmakers from doing their jobs and hiding what\\u2019s happening inside ICE detention centers. This is part of Trump\\u2019s broader effort to strip rights from Democrats, silence oversight, and punish political opposition.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/dhs-immigration-detention-center-visits-new-guidance\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Musk Calls Trump Adviser Sergio Gor a \\u201CSnake\\u201D Amid White House Feud</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk publicly attacked top Trump adviser Sergio Gor, calling him a \\u201Csnake\\u201D for allegedly sabotaging Musk\\u2019s NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman. Musk\\u2019s tirade followed a New York Post report\\u2014almost certainly leaked by Musk\\u2014claiming Gor failed to complete his security clearance. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is Kremlin-style infighting, now unfolding in Trump\\u2019s White House. Musk\\u2019s attack on Gor exposes the fractures and dysfunction tearing through Trump\\u2019s inner circle. In Russia, some of the dirtiest secrets come out when Kremlin insiders and oligarchs turn on each other.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/19/musk-sergio-gor-feud-00414246\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></code></pre><h4>From yesterday\\u2019s tracker\\u2026</h4><h3>Powerful Trump aide who\\u2019s in charge of vetting thousands of staffers still hasn\\u2019t been fully vetted himself: sources</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Sergio Gor, Trump\\u2019s personnel director in charge of vetting over 4,000 executive branch staffers, has not submitted the mandatory SF-86 form required for permanent security clearance, sources say. Despite holding an interim clearance and immense influence over appointments, Gor has resisted the process, citing distrust of the \\u201Cdeep state\\u201D and the FBI.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Gor isn\\u2019t even his real name, and he refused basic vetting. A Russian-born operative holds major power in Trump\\u2019s government with no transparency or accountability. This is a massive national security failure.</p><pre><code>Source: <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/us-news/sergio-gor-trump-aide-who-vets-thousands-of-staffers-hasnt-been-fully-vetted-himself-sources/\\\\\\\">New York Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Pregnant U.S. Citizen Detained by Border Patrol: 'We Didn\\u2019t Do Anything Wrong'</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Cary L\\u00F3pez Alvarado, a nine-month pregnant U.S. citizen, was violently arrested by Border Patrol in Hawthorne, CA, while defending her boyfriend and cousin\\u2014both Latino, one also a citizen. Agents chained her under her belly, reportedly assumed she was undocumented, and only released her after she complained of stomach pain. She gave birth days later. Her boyfriend, who has no criminal record, remains locked up in Texas.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is what Trump\\u2019s war on immigrants looks like\\u2014indiscriminate, racist, and cruel. A pregnant American citizen was shackled and humiliated. The regime is erasing rights, one brutal raid at a time.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/pregnant-u-s-citizen-detained-by-border-patrol-agents-in-l-a-county-we-didnt-do-anything-wrong/\\\\\\\">KTLA</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Republicans\\u2019 Social Security Attacks Disproportionately Harm Retirees of Color</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump continues gutting Social Security\\u2014closing field offices, cutting phone verification, and prepping mass purges\\u2014 as Musk spread false claims about noncitizen fraud. The result? Millions of seniors, especially in poor or rural areas, will be forced to verify their identities in person, even if the nearest office is hours away.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Older Americans without internet, transportation, or savings will be pushed to the brink. One missed check can mean eviction, hunger, or worse. These barriers are a deliberate attack on the most vulnerable to dismantle the safety net piece by piece.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/trump-musk-doge-social-security-race/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Hegseth Orders 'Passive Approach' to Juneteenth as Trump Kills DEI</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Pete Hegseth reportedly told Pentagon officials to take a \\u201Cpassive approach\\u201D to Juneteenth, the federal holiday marking the end of slavery. The internal directive comes amid Trump\\u2019s broader war on DEI, which Hegseth declared \\u201Cdead.\\u201D </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Erasing Juneteenth and gutting DEI is a deliberate attack on racial justice and historical truth. Trump is trying to rewrite what the military stands for, silencing progress and pushing a whitewashed agenda that distorts America\\u2019s past.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/hegseth-juneteenth-military-passive-approach\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Tensions Flare as Agents Arrest Another U.S. Citizen for \\u201CInterfering\\u201D in Immigration Arrests</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Adrian Martinez, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was violently arrested by Border Patrol during an immigration raid in Pico Rivera. Video shows him defending a man being detained before agents tackled and dragged him into a truck. His arrest is one of several in L.A. where Latino U.S. citizens have been caught in sweeping federal raids.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s deportation machine continues targeting American citizens\\u2014based on skin color and zip code. Racial profiling, constitutional abuse, and brute force are turning Latino neighborhoods into militarized zones.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-18/a-us-citizen-confronting-agents-during-a-sweep-is-arrested-as-tension-continue-to-simmer-on-la-strets\\\\\\\">Los Angeles Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCC9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Justice Dept. to Cut Two-Thirds of Inspectors Monitoring Gun Sales</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is slashing 541 of the roughly 800 inspectors who monitor gun dealers, gutting the ATF\\u2019s oversight capacity as part of a broader plan to weaken the agency and possibly merge it with the DEA. This follows the rollback of multiple Biden-era gun control rules and comes amid rising pressure to cut the ATF\\u2019s budget by nearly a third.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This guts protections that keep guns out of the wrong hands. Trump is siding with shady dealers and the gun lobby over basic public safety. By slashing inspections, he\\u2019s opening the floodgates for illegal sales\\u2014and more deadly violence in our communities and schools.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/justice-dept-guns-atf-trump.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>US Wildfire Response Crippled by Trump Cuts, Say Insiders</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As wildfire season ramps up, firefighters say the U.S. is dangerously exposed. Trump\\u2019s purges and agency dismantling have hollowed out support staff, delayed pay and healthcare, and left crews under-equipped. His chaotic plan to merge fire agencies under a new Interior Department unit has sown confusion, while critical science and prevention funding have been slashed or frozen.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With record heat and dry conditions already fueling fires, the country is heading into crisis with weakened defenses. Trump\\u2019s war on science and government is putting lives, homes, and entire communities at risk.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/summer-wildfire-preparedness\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>New Report Highlights Air Traffic Control Staffing Woes</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A new Congressional report warns of dangerous staffing shortages in the FAA, blaming excessive overtime, burnout, and outdated training pipelines. While Trump\\u2019s FAA bill includes $12.5 billion to fix it, the funding comes with steep cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and clean energy\\u2014sparking fierce opposition from Democrats.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> America\\u2019s air traffic system is on the edge. Near-misses are up, crashes are rising, and exhausted controllers are being stretched to the limit. Fixing it shouldn\\u2019t come at the cost of basic social safety nets.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/faa-report-staffing.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>How Netanyahu Pushed Trump Toward War</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persuaded Trump to support a military strike on Iran after a failed diplomatic effort. Initially resistant, Trump changed course, and Israeli officials presented intelligence claiming Iran was secretly advancing its nuclear weapons program.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Netanyahu\\u2019s maneuvering marks a pivotal shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Trump now backing war against Iran. Despite U.S. intelligence doubting Iran\\u2019s political intent to build a bomb, Israel\\u2019s influence set the stage for a regional war with unpredictable consequences.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://time.com/7295726/netanyahu-trump-israel-iran-nuclear-strikes/\\\\\\\">TIME</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>In Crisis With Iran, U.S. Military Officials Focus on Strait of Hormuz</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> As Trump considers entering Israel\\u2019s war with Iran, the Pentagon is preparing for Tehran to mine the Strait of Hormuz\\u2014a chokepoint for 25% of global oil. Iran has done it before and retains the missiles, drones, and regional proxies to strike. Military officials warn U.S. forces could be directly targeted.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Blocking the strait would detonate a global energy crisis and drag the U.S. into another endless war. Trump is playing with fire with no strategy or plan.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/us/politics/iran-us-military-strait-of-hormuz.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Spain Rejects Trump\\u2019s NATO Spending Demands Ahead of Summit</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\\u00E1nchez pushed back against Trump\\u2019s demand that NATO countries rapidly meet higher defense spending targets, calling the request \\u201Cunreasonable\\u201D and warning it could harm economic growth. The rejection has disrupted careful diplomatic planning ahead of the NATO summit.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s bullying is straining NATO from within. As Russia\\u2019s genocidal war grinds on and Europe is under threat from further Russian aggression, his demands are straining unity and pushing allies like Spain to push back. </p><pre><code><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-nato-spending-increase-f9d105eb41d708acc78356599032b95a\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trying to Satisfy Trump, NATO Is Running Into Difficulties</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a rush to placate Trump before next week\\u2019s NATO summit, allies are inflating defense spending to hit his arbitrary 5% of GDP demand. NATO chief Mark Rutte is proposing creative accounting\\u2014counting infrastructure, health spending, and Ukraine aid as \\u201Cmilitary-adjacent\\u201D\\u2014to make the numbers work, though there\\u2019s no clear timeline or enforcement plan.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is bullying NATO into flashy metrics while ignoring the alliance\\u2019s actual defense needs. It\\u2019s a dangerous charade that leaves Europe vulnerable\\u2014and puts collective security at the mercy of Trump\\u2019s ego.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/world/europe/nato-spending-russia-trump.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF0D Far-Right &amp; Russian Influence Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>U.S. Pushing Allies to Limit Focus on Ukraine in NATO Summit Communique</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. is pressuring NATO allies to downplay Ukraine in next week\\u2019s summit communique, pushing for only a brief mention of Kyiv\\u2019s defense capabilities and excluding any broad statement of support. The current draft marks a sharp break from past summits, where NATO strongly backed Ukraine\\u2019s fight against Russia.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump continues weakening NATO and betraying Ukraine while cozying up to Putin.

Led by Russian nationals Lev Andriashvili and Irina Yakovenko, the network allegedly funneled money, ran focus groups, and spread disinformation through civic groups and social media to manipulate public opinion and influence politics in Argentina.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Russia always does this\\u2014it\\u2019s baked into the Kremlin\\u2019s playbook. For every influence operation exposed, hundreds more are already in motion. The goal is division, confusion, and chaos.

Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and others accuse Trump of betraying his isolationist \\u201CAmerica First\\u201D promise, while GOP hawks like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham push for full support of Israel\\u2019s war, including U.S. bombers and joint strikes.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The MAGA base is fracturing. Trump is caught between his anti-war brand and the push for war with Iran. If he caves to hawks, he risks losing his core supporters. If he resists, he faces rebellion inside the GOP. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/trump-maga-base-iran-israel.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCB5 In Trump Economic Downturn News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>China Learned a Valuable Lesson in U.S. Trade Talks: The Value of Its Leverage</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Despite Trump claiming victory in a new U.S.-China trade deal, Beijing emerged emboldened. The agreement mostly restores a prior truce, while leaving Trump\\u2019s tariffs in place. China, however, has gained key concessions\\u2014like access to U.S. markets for rare earths\\u2014after strategically throttling exports and exploiting Trump\\u2019s eagerness for a deal.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s bluster is masking a strategic loss.

The spike in concern is closely tied to Trump\\u2019s erratic tariffs, which are fueling fears of rising costs and economic instability.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Consumers are cutting back on spending and turning to credit, with inflation and recession fears reaching two-year highs. The findings signal weakening confidence and growing financial stress under Trump\\u2019s economic policies.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/us-consumers-more-pessimistic-tariff-costs-transunion-says-2025-06-18/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Is Driving Off Investors and Threatening the Dollar\\u2019s Reign</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Since Trump\\u2019s return to power, the U.S. dollar has plunged over 10% against major currencies. Soaring deficits, tariff chaos, and Trump\\u2019s pressure campaign on the Fed have spooked investors. Foreign creditors are taking hits, and hedge funds have stacked up $16 billion in bets against the dollar. Analysts warn the freefall isn\\u2019t over.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The dollar is no longer the world\\u2019s safe bet and is becoming a liability.

The sharp drop pushed Switzerland\\u2019s trade surplus to a five-year low, while U.S. exports to Switzerland rose 6.5%. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s erratic tariff war is shaking global markets and straining relationships with key allies. The Swiss export collapse is a red flag\\u2014proof that even stable, high-end economies are scrambling to shield themselves. If this continues, Trump\\u2019s trade tactics could tip the world into a recession.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a
