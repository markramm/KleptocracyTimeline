Trump, who flew in with Elon Musk and his son, praised the strikes while guests dined in luxury.Why It Matters: National security decisions were made over unencrypted text messages, violating federal protocols and potentially the Espionage Act. Then, instead of facing accountability, Trump\u2019s inner circle bragged about the strikes and celebrated at a private dinner with the ultra-wealthy. The regime isn't just reckless\u2014it\u2019s flaunting its impunity.Source: WIREDTrump Media Stock Surges on ETF Deal with Crypto.comWhat Happened: Trump Media shares jumped 9% in after-hours trading following the announcement of a partnership with Crypto.com to launch ETFs and related financial products under the brand Truth.Fi. The ETFs will have a \u201cMade in America\u201d focus and include a mix of cryptocurrencies and traditional securities.Why It Matters: This deepens Trump\u2019s business ties with the crypto industry while blurring the line between his presidency and financial ventures. Trump Media, despite a $4.6 billion market cap, reported a $400 million loss in 2024, raising concerns over its long-term viability.Source: CNBCTrump Donor John Phelan Confirmed as Navy SecretaryWhat Happened: The Senate confirmed John Phelan, a private investment firm founder and major Trump donor, as the new Navy secretary. Phelan, who has no prior military experience, donated nearly $1 million to Trump\u2019s fundraising committee and hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for him.Why It Matters: Phelan\u2019s appointment highlights his lack of qualifications and the increasing trend of major donors securing top government roles. While he claims his \"business experience will help fix Navy inefficiencies, he has zero military or defense sector leadership.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsJustice Dept. Refuses to Give Judge Flight Data, Citing State SecretsWhat Happened: Trump refused to provide a federal judge with details on deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants, invoking the \u201cstate secrets\u201d privilege. The move defies court orders and escalates tensions between the White House and the judiciary.Why It Matters: This is a blatant act of defiance against judicial oversight, setting a dangerous precedent where the executive branch can block courts from reviewing its actions. The regime\u2019s use of state secrets to shield deportations\u2014after posting a propaganda video of detainees\u2014 reiterates constitutional concerns over due process and separation of powers.Source: The New York TimesInside Elon Musk and Russ Vought\u2019s Quiet AllianceWhat Happened: Musk and Trump budget director Russ Vought have formed a strategic alliance to dismantle federal agencies and purge federal workers. Musk leads high-profile raids on government offices, using AI and tech under the guise of identifying \u201cwasteful spending,\u201d while Vought\u2019s Office of Management and Budget provides the bureaucratic framework to make the cuts permanent.Why It Matters: This coordinated assault on the federal government dismantles oversight and slashes public services. Agencies are crippled, understaffed, and wide open to corruption. Musk\u2019s headline-grabbing purges create chaos, while Vought quietly restructures the system to entrench far-right ideology. The goal isn\u2019t efficiency\u2014it\u2019s control.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsEd Martin Is Trampling the Rule of Law. And He Won\u2019t Shut Up About It.What Happened: Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney and extremist Ed Martin is aggressively reshaping the Justice Department into a political weapon, launching investigations into career prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases, threatening Trump\u2019s critics, and offering DOJ resources to protect Musk. He has also targeted journalists and sought to seize Biden-era climate funds under dubious legal claims.Why It Matters: Martin\u2019s actions are part of Trump\u2019s broader push to weaponize the DOJ for political retribution and against opposition. By dismantling independent prosecutions, targeting journalists, and shielding Musk\u2019s operations, he is eroding the rule of law and paving the way for authoritarian control. This isn\u2019t justice\u2014it\u2019s a power grab.Source: Mother JonesTrump Installs Loyalist Alina Habba as U.S. Attorney for New JerseyWhat Happened: Trump appointed his former personal attorney Alina Habba as interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a role traditionally reserved for experienced federal prosecutors. Habba, known for defending Trump in lawsuits against political enemies, has no background in criminal prosecution.Why It Matters: This is pure cronyism. Trump is stuffing the Justice Department with loyalists, turning prosecutors\u2019 offices into political weapons. Habba\u2019s appointment signals that the DOJ under Trump isn\u2019t about law and order\u2014it\u2019s about targeting his enemies and shielding his allies.Source: ABC NewsRepublicans Push to Impeach Two More Judges Blocking Trump\u2019s AgendaWhat Happened: House Republicans, led by Reps. Andrew Clyde and Andy Ogles filed impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges John McConnell and Theodore Chuang. McConnell had blocked Trump's freeze on federal grants, while Chuang ruled against the regime\u2019s move to shut down USAID.Why It Matters: This is an outright attack on judicial independence. Republicans have now targeted at least six judges who ruled against Trump, ignoring Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 warning that impeachment is not a tool for political retaliation. With little chance of conviction in the Senate, this is pure intimidation\u2014meant to chill opposition and bend the judiciary to Trump\u2019s will.Source: ReutersFBI says it is probing 'increase in violent activity toward Tesla'What Happened: FBI Director Kash Patel announced an intensified probe into an increase in violent incidents targeting Tesla. The bureau has taken additional steps to crack down on such activity, labeling it \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201dWhy It Matters: With countless national security threats facing the U.S., the decision to dedicate full federal resources to Tesla raises questions about political and corporate influence over law enforcement priorities.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Fuels a Disinformation Machine to Justify Policy AttacksWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s second term has institutionalized disinformation to justify sweeping policy changes. His regime is weaponizing lies to slash government programs. Officials including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have spread lies to attack everything from foreign aid to vaccines. Disinformation is now official White House policy, with Musk and far-right media amplifying the propaganda to tens of millions.Why It Matters: Just like Russia, the U.S. government is now built on a foundation of lies. Trump and his officials are using disinformation as a governing strategy, warping public perception to dismantle institutions and justify authoritarian policies. With Musk controlling X, these lies spread unchecked.Source: The New York TimesFight or cut a deal? Law firms face stark choice under TrumpWhat Happened: Trump issued executive orders targeting law firms Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie over their work for his political opponents and diversity policies. Paul Weiss cut a deal, pledging $40 million in pro bono work for Trump\u2019s agenda, while Perkins Coie is suing to block the order. Trump has since directed the DOJ to target firms handling immigration cases or those that sued the government in the past eight years.Why It Matters: This is an authoritarian attack on the legal profession. Trump is imposing a loyalty test on attorneys, silencing dissent, and punishing firms defending civil rights. This weaponization of executive power is unprecedented and threatens independent legal representation.Source: ReutersNew York Times denounces Trump\u2019s \u2018intimidation tactics\u2019 against reportersWhat Happened: The New York Times publicly denounced Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on its reporters following Trump\u2019s backlash against the paper\u2019s coverage of Elon Musk\u2019s planned secret briefing on China war plans at the Defense Department. Why It Matters: The Times warns that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is not just about personal grievances but part of a broader strategy to intimidate the press, suppress investigative reporting, and erode public trust in journalism. Source: Associated PressIn Karoline Leavitt\u2019s World, Trump\u2019s Word Is EnoughWhat Happened: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has fully embraced Trump\u2019s media war, enforcing loyalty tests, restricting access to reporters who challenge Trump, and promoting disinformation as official policy. Whether banning the Associated Press from the Oval Office over refusing to use \"Gulf of America\" or falsely claiming $50 million was spent on condoms in Gaza, Leavitt delivers Trump\u2019s agenda with unwavering conviction.Why It Matters: Leavitt represents the next generation of Trump loyalists, raised in an environment where truth is secondary to political loyalty. Her approach further cements the White House\u2019s authoritarian-style control over information, sidelining dissenting voices and rewarding sycophantic media.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsAppeals court judge says Nazis were treated better than Venezuelans under Alien Enemies ActWhat Happened: A federal appeals court judge slammed Trump\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, comparing their treatment to that of Nazis during World War II\u2014who at least got hearings before being removed. The court challenged the government\u2019s refusal to provide hearings for those deported to El Salvador\u2019s notorious maximum-security prison.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s weaponization of the Alien Enemies Act to bypass legal rights is unprecedented and a dangerous expansion of emergency powers. This is a test run\u2014next, it will be used to silence and target anyone critical of the regime.Source: CBS NewsTrump seeking to deport 21-year-old Columbia protester and green card holder, lawsuit saysWhat Happened: Trump is trying to deport 21-year-old Columbia student and green card holder Yunseo Chung, citing her pro-Palestinian activism as a threat to U.S. foreign policy. ICE issued an administrative warrant\u2014without judicial approval\u2014days after her campus arrest. Why It Matters: This is political repression\u2014Trump is weaponizing immigration enforcement to silence dissent and as a tool against free speech. Source: CBS NewsTrump rolls back restrictions on sharing migrant minor sponsors' immigration statusWhat Happened: Trump has rolled back restrictions on sharing the immigration status of sponsors of unaccompanied migrant minors with law enforcement. The Office of Refugee Resettlement will now provide this data to ICE, and it will no longer be barred from denying child releases based on a sponsor\u2019s immigration status. Trump also ended a federal legal aid program for migrant children.Why It Matters: This will deter undocumented parents from claiming their children, leaving more kids in detention. Immigration advocates say the legal aid shutdown violates due process and puts minors at greater risk of deportation without representation.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchThe Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War PlansWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s top national security officials, including Mike Waltz and Pete Hegseth, accidentally added The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat detailing classified military strikes on Yemen. The chat included weapons payloads, targets, and timing. Goldberg thought it was a prank\u2014until the bombs hit exactly as planned.Why It Matters: This is staggering incompetence and a national security disaster. Trump\u2019s team used an unsecured messaging app to plan a war, failed to notice a journalist in the chat, and openly discussed state secrets\u2014a reckless act that could violate the Espionage Act. What other secret chats exist?Source: The AtlanticUsing Starlink Wi-Fi in the White House Is a Slippery Slope for US Federal ITWhat Happened: Trump is installing Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet in the White House, claiming it will \"improve Wi-Fi connectivity.\" However, the system is being routed through an off-site data center miles away\u2014a setup security experts call unnecessary, inefficient, and alarmingly vulnerable.Why It Matters: This isn\u2019t about internet access\u2014it\u2019s about control. The move bypasses existing White House cybersecurity protocols, raising concerns that Musk's company, and adversaries, could gain unprecedented access to federal communications. This risks exposing sensitive government data while entrenching White House dependence on a private business controlled by Trump\u2019s closest ally.Source: WIREDDealing With Social Security Is Heading From Bad to WorseWhat Happened: The Social Security Administration is slashing staff, closing field offices, and restricting phone services as part of Musk\u2019s overhaul. Retirees and beneficiaries are experiencing record-long wait times, forcing many to navigate the system online or visit overwhelmed field offices.Why It Matters: With over 70 million Americans relying on Social Security, these cuts will erode trust in the program and create unnecessary hardships. Bottom line: this is laying the groundwork to dismantle Social Security.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump Education Cuts Spark Fears of Student Loan System CollapseWhat Happened: The mass firing of 300 employees from the Federal Student Aid office has triggered concerns about fraud, errors, and system failures in the $1.6 trillion student loan program. Why It Matters: With the removal of compliance teams, experts warn that for-profit colleges now have a free pass to engage in fraud and abuse, reminiscent of the 1980s crisis that led to a 41% student loan default rate. Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchGreenland to Trump: We Didn\u2019t Invite YouWhat Happened: Greenland\u2019s government forcefully denied Trump\u2019s claim that it invited a U.S. delegation led by Second Lady Usha Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. Outgoing Prime Minister M\u00fate B. Egede condemned the visit as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cvery aggressive\u201d push to seize the Arctic island. Protesters in Sisimiut are planning demonstrations against the delegation\u2019s arrival, following weeks of backlash over Trump\u2019s threats to take control of Greenland through military force or economic coercion.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s renewed push for Greenland mirrors Putin\u2019s imperial ambitions\u2014ignoring sovereignty, straining U.S.-Denmark relations, and fueling a backlash. Greenlanders have made it clear: they won\u2019t be bought or annexed.Source: PoliticoTrump Prompts European Calls for a Homegrown Nuclear UmbrellaWhat Happened: European leaders are increasingly questioning the reliability of U.S. nuclear protection as Trump shifts his stance on NATO, moves towards Russia, and pressures Europe to take on more of its defense. This uncertainty has led to renewed discussions about a European nuclear umbrella, possibly relying on France and the U.K.\u2019s existing arsenals.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s abandonment of Europe is pushing allies toward nuclear self-reliance, fueling a new arms race. Germany and Poland are exploring independent deterrence as trust in U.S. security guarantees collapses. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s Pentagon clings to control, ensuring maximum chaos while allies scramble for alternatives.Source: Wall Street JournalVance on Trump Admin\u2019s Plans to Bomb Houthis: \u2018I Just Hate Bailing Europe Out Again\u2019What Happened: Vice President Vance privately expressed skepticism about Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to leaked messages from a Signal group chat with regime officials. In the chat, Vance questioned why the U.S. should act when European trade relies more heavily on the Suez Canal, stating, \u201cI just hate bailing Europe out again.\u201dWhy It Matters: Vance\u2019s reluctance exposes Trump\u2019s escalating betrayal of Europe\u2014hesitating to defend allies while embracing isolationism. Trump\u2019s erratic stance fuels instability, weakens NATO, and hands strategic victories to Russia, all while actively undermining European security.Source: The Hill\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchSteve Witkoff Takes the Kremlin\u2019s SideWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy, Steve Witkoff, echoed Russian propaganda in an interview with Tucker Carlson, downplaying Putin\u2019s bloody imperialist territorial ambitions and legitimizing sham referendums\u2014under gunpoint\u2014 in illegally occupied Ukraine. He dismissed European security concerns and mocked allied peacekeeping efforts as \u201cposturing.\u201dWhy It Matters: Witkoff\u2019s rhetoric highlights the Trump regime's loyalty to Moscow, undermines Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and alienates U.S. allies. By echoing Putin\u2019s demands, Trump\u2019s team is trying to strong-arm Ukraine into surrender, emboldening Russian aggression.Source: The Wall Street JournalPutin Gifts Trump a Portrait What Happened: Putin gifted Trump a portrait of himself, personally commissioned by the Kremlin. The painting was delivered by Steve Witkoff, during his visit to Moscow for sham \u201cnegotiations\u201d on Ukraine.Why It Matters: A war criminal who is orchestrating genocide in Ukraine is personally honoring Trump with a gift, and his envoy is celebrating it. This mirrors Soviet-era espionage tactics, raising grave national security concerns\u2014yet the White House won\u2019t even confirm if they\u2019ve checked the portrait for surveillance devices. Source: Associated Press \ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrade War Explodes Across World at Pace Not Seen in DecadesWhat Happened: Trade barriers are rising worldwide at a pace not seen since the 1930s, as Trump\u2019s aggressive tariffs trigger retaliatory measures from China, Canada, and the European Union. Countries are imposing new restrictions to protect their industries, fearing economic fallout from Trump\u2019s escalating trade war.Why It Matters: Economists warn this surge in protectionism could slow global growth, increase inflation, and fracture alliances, with the World Trade Organization struggling to maintain order. Trump\u2019s upcoming trade plan threatens to escalate tensions further by imposing \"reciprocal\" levies against major U.S. trading partners. If fully enacted, U.S. tariffs could reach their highest levels in 90 years.Source: Wall Street JournalCanadian Tourists Boycott U.S. Over Trump\u2019s Annexation ThreatsWhat Happened: Canadian travelers are canceling U.S. vacations at unprecedented rates in response to Trump\u2019s threats of annexation and increased tariffs on Canada. Airline bookings and border crossings have declined sharply, with many opting for travel to Europe, Mexico, or domestic destinations instead.Why It Matters: Canada is the top source of international visitors to the U.S., and their boycott threatens local economies across major tourist destinations. A 10% drop in Canadian tourism could cost the U.S. economy $2 billion and 14,000 jobs. Despite this, Trump\u2019s regime continues to threaten annexation, with a White House spokesperson claiming Canadians will eventually \u201cbecome American citizens\u201d as part of a 51st state.Source: Wall Street JournalTesla\u2019s Europe Sales Collapse Amid Anti-Musk BacklashWhat Happened: Tesla's share of European EV sales plummeted by 58% in the first two months of 2025, dropping from 18.4% in 2024 to just 7.7% this year. Meanwhile, Chinese EV brands surged, selling nearly 20,000 vehicles in Europe last month, surpassing Tesla's 15,700 units.Why It Matters: The collapse in sales is driven by mounting European backlash against Musk, particularly in Germany, where his association with Trump and far-right politics has fueled widespread boycotts. A survey of 100,000 Germans found that 94% would no longer buy a Tesla. Source: Politico\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsAdvocates Sue to Stop Trump\u2019s Dismantling of U.S. Education DepartmentWhat Happened: Teachers\u2019 unions, the NAACP, and education advocates sued Trump to block its attempt to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. The lawsuit argues that Trump\u2019s actions violate congressional mandates and the Constitution.Source: ReutersMilitary veterans are becoming the face of Trump\u2019s government cuts and Democrats\u2019 resistanceWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s aggressive federal budget cuts have disproportionately impacted military veterans, who make up nearly 30% of the federal workforce. Layoffs at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a purge of Pentagon archives documenting diversity in the military have left veterans struggling to access earned benefits and employment.Source: Associated PressJudge Blocks Musk\u2019s DOGE From Accessing Sensitive U.S. Agency DataWhat Happened: A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing Musk and his operatives from accessing private data held by the Education Department, Treasury Department, and Office of Personnel Management. The ruling follows a lawsuit from labor unions, led by the American Federation of Teachers, alleging Trump violated federal privacy laws by granting unauthorized FAKE DOGE access to sensitive personal records.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers80,000 \u2014 Number of jobs Trump plans to cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs.$1 million \u2014 Cost per seat at Trump\u2019s secret Mar-a-Lago dinner attended by officials including Michael Waltz, Marco Rubio, and Stephen Miller.$1 million \u2014 Amount Navy Secretary John Phelan donated to Trump\u2019s fundraising committee before securing his government appointment.70 million \u2014 Number of Americans relying on Social Security, now facing longer wait times and service disruptions due to Trump\u2019s cuts.$1.6 trillion \u2014 Total outstanding student loan debt overseen by the Federal Student Aid office, now at risk of system failures after mass firings.300 \u2014 Number of Federal Student Aid employees fired, raising concerns about fraud and system collapse.94% \u2014 Percentage of Germans in a survey who said they would no longer buy a Tesla due to Musk\u2019s ties to Trump and far-right politics.$2 billion \u2014 Estimated economic loss from the Canadian tourist boycott of U.S. destinations.58% \u2014 Decline in Tesla\u2019s market share of European EV sales in the first two months of 2025.9% \u2014 Surge in Trump Media\u2019s stock price following the Crypto.com ETF deal, despite the company losing $400 million in 2024.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump\u2019s Next Moves on Social Security & Medicare \u2014 Are entitlement programs the next target in budget cuts?

Europe\u2019s Nuclear Debate Intensifies \u2014 As Trump distances the U.S. from NATO and cozies up to Putin, Germany and Poland may take serious steps toward a European nuclear deterrent, triggering a new arms race.\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policy is raising prices for Americans and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions.Authoritarian Creep \u2014 From deporting activists to silencing judges and weaponizing the DOJ, Trump\u2019s regime is systematically dismantling checks and balances.Musk\u2019s Growing Power \u2014 With control over government data, federal agency purges, and now White House cybersecurity, Musk\u2019s influence over Trump\u2019s regime is reaching dangerous new heights.Signal Chat Scandal Exposes National Security Danger \u2014 Trump\u2019s officials planned military strikes on an unsecured messaging app, accidentally included a journalist, and openly discussed classified war plans that could violate the Espionage Act.Legal System Under Siege \u2014 Trump\u2019s attacks on law firms, judicial impeachment threats, and DOJ purges highlight a broader agenda to erode legal independence and punish opposition.Europe Prepares for Life Without U.S. Protection \u2014 With Trump\u2019s hostility toward NATO, allies are being forced to consider nuclear deterrents and independent defense strategies, further weakening transatlantic ties.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

unsecured Signal chat\u2014Trump officials, including Michael Waltz, Marco Rubio, and Stephen Miller, attended a secret $1-million-per-seat dinner at Mar-a-Lago.

Reading this newsletter daily is an exercise in converting sets of pointillist facts into a broader coherent picture.  In the chaos of the first weeks it was difficult to discern the future of this sea change in American affairs. Now it is easier to venture some predictions. A large group of powerful people are trying to shape a country into something closer to their philosophical and economic interests.  They prefer to remain out of the public eye, preferring to work through proxies. Their proxies are a mixed group in terms of competence, giving the coup  both startling efficiency and amateurish ineptitude. The coup is not originating from Russia, who remains an opportunistic onlooker only partially sympathetic. China is alarmed. Allies are alarmed. The confederation of powerful entities are a loose alliance but primarily American based.  They distrust military solutions. America will not be going into a major war. But although the coalition is powerful it will ultimately decohere and fairly soon.  The old America is not coming back but what does will be very similar.  No civil war, no lives lost.  But we will have to wage a desperate fight to achieve even this future </span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 24</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his

Fiasco Attended Secret Mar-a-Lago Dinner Shortly After Celebrating Bombing</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Hours after bombing Yemen\\u2014details of which were accidentally leaked to a journalist in an unsecured Signal chat\\u2014Trump officials, including Michael Waltz, Marco Rubio, and Stephen Miller, attended a secret $1-million-per-seat dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Trump, who flew in with Elon Musk and his son, praised the strikes while guests dined in luxury.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> National security decisions were made over unencrypted text messages, violating federal protocols and potentially the Espionage Act. Then, instead of facing accountability, Trump\\u2019s inner circle bragged about the strikes and celebrated at a private dinner with the ultra-wealthy. The regime isn't just reckless\\u2014it\\u2019s flaunting its impunity.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/trump-officials-signal-chat-candlelight-dinner-mar-a-lago-yemen/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Media Stock Surges on ETF Deal with Crypto.com</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump Media shares jumped 9% in after-hours trading following the announcement of a partnership with Crypto.com to launch ETFs and related financial products under the brand Truth.Fi. The ETFs will have a \\u201CMade in America\\u201D focus and include a mix of cryptocurrencies and traditional securities.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This deepens Trump\\u2019s business ties with the crypto industry while blurring the line between his presidency and financial ventures. Trump Media, despite a $4.6 billion market cap, reported a $400 million loss in 2024, raising concerns over its long-term viability.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/trump-media-shares-jump-on-announcement-of-etf-deal-with-cryptocom.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Donor John Phelan Confirmed as Navy Secretary</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Senate confirmed John Phelan, a private investment firm founder and major Trump donor, as the new Navy secretary. Phelan, who has no prior military experience, donated nearly $1 million to Trump\\u2019s fundraising committee and hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Phelan\\u2019s appointment highlights his lack of qualifications and the increasing trend of major donors securing top government roles. While he claims his \\\\\\\"business experience will help fix Navy inefficiencies, he has zero military or defense sector leadership.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5211395-trump-donor-john-phelan-confirmed-as-navy-secretary/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Justice Dept. Refuses to Give Judge Flight Data, Citing State Secrets</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump refused to provide a federal judge with details on deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants, invoking the \\u201Cstate secrets\\u201D privilege. The move defies court orders and escalates tensions between the White House and the judiciary.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a blatant act of defiance against judicial oversight, setting a dangerous precedent where the executive branch can block courts from reviewing its actions. The regime\\u2019s use of state secrets to shield deportations\\u2014after posting a propaganda video of detainees\\u2014 reiterates constitutional concerns over due process and separation of powers.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/us/politics/judge-ruling-trump-deportations-alien-enemies-act.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Inside Elon Musk and Russ Vought\\u2019s Quiet Alliance</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Musk and Trump budget director Russ Vought have formed a strategic alliance to dismantle federal agencies and purge federal workers. Musk leads high-profile raids on government offices, using AI and tech under the guise of identifying \\u201Cwasteful spending,\\u201D while Vought\\u2019s Office of Management and Budget provides the bureaucratic framework to make the cuts permanent.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This coordinated assault on the federal government dismantles oversight and slashes public services. Agencies are crippled, understaffed, and wide open to corruption. Musk\\u2019s headline-grabbing purges create chaos, while Vought quietly restructures the system to entrench far-right ideology.

And He Won\\u2019t Shut Up About It.</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump-appointed interim U.S. Attorney and extremist Ed Martin is aggressively reshaping the Justice Department into a political weapon, launching investigations into career prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases, threatening Trump\\u2019s critics, and offering DOJ resources to protect Musk. He has also targeted journalists and sought to seize Biden-era climate funds under dubious legal claims.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Martin\\u2019s actions are part of Trump\\u2019s broader push to weaponize the DOJ for political retribution and against opposition. By dismantling independent prosecutions, targeting journalists, and shielding Musk\\u2019s operations, he is eroding the rule of law and paving the way for authoritarian control.

Habba, known for defending Trump in lawsuits against political enemies, has no background in criminal prosecution.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is pure cronyism. Trump is stuffing the Justice Department with loyalists, turning prosecutors\\u2019 offices into political weapons. Habba\\u2019s appointment signals that the DOJ under Trump isn\\u2019t about law and order\\u2014it\\u2019s about targeting his enemies and shielding his allies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-appoints-alina-habba-us-attorney-new-jersey/story?id=120099632\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Republicans Push to Impeach Two More Judges Blocking Trump\\u2019s Agenda</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> House Republicans, led by Reps. Andrew Clyde and Andy Ogles filed impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges John McConnell and Theodore Chuang. McConnell had blocked Trump's freeze on federal grants, while Chuang ruled against the regime\\u2019s move to shut down USAID.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an outright attack on judicial independence. Republicans have now targeted at least six judges who ruled against Trump, ignoring Chief Justice John Roberts\\u2019 warning that impeachment is not a tool for political retaliation. With little chance of conviction in the Senate, this is pure intimidation\\u2014meant to chill opposition and bend the judiciary to Trump\\u2019s will.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-seek-impeachment-2-more-judges-who-stymied-trump-2025-03-24/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>FBI says it is probing 'increase in violent activity toward Tesla'</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FBI Director Kash Patel announced an intensified probe into an increase in violent incidents targeting Tesla.

His regime is weaponizing lies to slash government programs. Officials including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have spread lies to attack everything from foreign aid to vaccines. Disinformation is now official White House policy, with Musk and far-right media amplifying the propaganda to tens of millions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Just like Russia, the U.S. government is now built on a foundation of lies. Trump and his officials are using disinformation as a governing strategy, warping public perception to dismantle institutions and justify authoritarian policies. With Musk controlling X, these lies spread unchecked.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/trump-misinformation-false-claims.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Fight or cut a deal? Law firms face stark choice under Trump</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump issued executive orders targeting law firms Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie over their work for his political opponents and diversity policies. Paul Weiss cut a deal, pledging $40 million in pro bono work for Trump\\u2019s agenda, while Perkins Coie is suing to block the order. Trump has since directed the DOJ to target firms handling immigration cases or those that sued the government in the past eight years.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian attack on the legal profession. Trump is imposing a loyalty test on attorneys, silencing dissent, and punishing firms defending civil rights. This weaponization of executive power is unprecedented and threatens independent legal representation.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/fight-or-cut-deal-law-firms-face-stark-choice-under-trump-2025-03-25/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>New York Times denounces Trump\\u2019s \\u2018intimidation tactics\\u2019 against reporters</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The New York Times publicly denounced Trump\\u2019s escalating attacks on its reporters following Trump\\u2019s backlash against the paper\\u2019s coverage of Elon Musk\\u2019s planned secret briefing on China war plans at the Defense Department. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The Times warns that Trump\\u2019s rhetoric is not just about personal grievances but part of a broader strategy to intimidate the press, suppress investigative reporting, and erode public trust in journalism. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-reporters-new-york-times-a0a334b515782814fb4ed35f386b4b6e\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>In Karoline Leavitt\\u2019s World, Trump\\u2019s Word Is Enough</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has fully embraced Trump\\u2019s media war, enforcing loyalty tests, restricting access to reporters who challenge Trump, and promoting disinformation as official policy. Whether banning the Associated Press from the Oval Office over refusing to use \\\\\\\"Gulf of America\\\\\\\" or falsely claiming $50 million was spent on condoms in Gaza, Leavitt delivers Trump\\u2019s agenda with unwavering conviction.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Leavitt represents the next generation of Trump loyalists, raised in an environment where truth is secondary to political loyalty. Her approach further cements the White House\\u2019s authoritarian-style control over information, sidelining dissenting voices and rewarding sycophantic media.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2025/03/24/karoline-leavitt-trump-press-secretary/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Appeals court judge says Nazis were treated better than Venezuelans under Alien Enemies Act</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A federal appeals court judge slammed Trump\\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, comparing their treatment to that of Nazis during World War II\\u2014who at least got hearings before being removed. The court challenged the government\\u2019s refusal to provide hearings for those deported to El Salvador\\u2019s notorious maximum-security prison.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s weaponization of the Alien Enemies Act to bypass legal rights is unprecedented and a dangerous expansion of emergency powers.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement will now provide this data to ICE, and it will no longer be barred from denying child releases based on a sponsor\\u2019s immigration status. Trump also ended a federal legal aid program for migrant children.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This will deter undocumented parents from claiming their children, leaving more kids in detention.

The chat included weapons payloads, targets, and timing. Goldberg thought it was a prank\\u2014until the bombs hit exactly as planned.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is staggering incompetence and a national security disaster.

The move bypasses existing White House cybersecurity protocols, raising concerns that Musk's company, and adversaries, could gain unprecedented access to federal communications.

Countries are imposing new restrictions to protect their industries, fearing economic fallout from Trump\\u2019s escalating trade war.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Economists warn this surge in protectionism could slow global growth, increase inflation, and fracture alliances, with the World Trade Organization struggling to maintain order.

Airline bookings and border crossings have declined sharply, with many opting for travel to Europe, Mexico, or domestic destinations instead.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Canada is the top source of international visitors to the U.S., and their boycott threatens local economies across major tourist destinations. A 10% drop in Canadian tourism could cost the U.S. economy $2 billion and 14,000 jobs. Despite this, Trump\\u2019s regime continues to threaten annexation, with a White House spokesperson claiming Canadians will eventually \\u201Cbecome American citizens\\u201D as part of a 51st state.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/trump-canada-vacation-travel-plans-1428d574?mod=hp_lead_pos9\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Tesla\\u2019s Europe Sales Collapse Amid Anti-Musk Backlash</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tesla's share of European EV sales plummeted by 58% in the first two months of 2025, dropping from 18.4% in 2024 to just 7.7% this year. Meanwhile, Chinese EV brands surged, selling nearly 20,000 vehicles in Europe last month, surpassing Tesla's 15,700 units.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The collapse in sales is driven by mounting European backlash against Musk, particularly in Germany, where his association with Trump and far-right politics has fueled widespread boycotts.

In the chaos of the first weeks it was difficult to discern the future of this sea change in American affairs. Now it is easier to venture some predictions. A large group of powerful people are trying to shape a country into something closer to their philosophical and economic interests.  They prefer to remain out of the public eye, preferring to work through proxies. Their proxies are a mixed group in terms of competence, giving the coup  both startling efficiency and amateurish ineptitude. The coup is not originating from Russia, who remains an opportunistic onlooker only partially sympathetic. China is alarmed. Allies are alarmed. The confederation of powerful entities are a loose alliance but primarily American based.  They distrust military solutions. America will not be going into a major war. But although the coalition is powerful it will ultimately decohere and fairly soon.  The old America is not coming back but what does will be very similar.  No civil war, no lives lost.

In the chaos of the first weeks it was difficult to discern the future of this sea change in American affairs. Now it is easier to venture some predictions. A large group of powerful people are trying to shape a country into something closer to their philosophical and economic interests. They prefer to remain out of the public eye, preferring to work through proxies. Their proxies are a mixed group in terms of competence, giving the coup both startling efficiency and amateurish ineptitude. The coup is not originating from Russia, who remains an opportunistic onlooker only partially sympathetic. China is alarmed. Allies are alarmed. The confederation of powerful entities are a loose alliance but primarily American based. They distrust military solutions. America will not be going into a major war. But although the coalition is powerful it will ultimately decohere and fairly soon. The old America is not coming back but what does will be very similar. No civil war, no lives lost. But we will have to wage a desperate fight to achieve even this future\\\"}]}]},\\\"publication_id\\\":2360486,\\\"post_id\\\":159799863,\\\"user_id\\\":59416223,\\\"ancestor_path\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"comment\\\",\\\"deleted\\\":false,\\\"date\\\":\\\"2025-03-25T08:53:01.806Z\\\",\\\"edited_at\\\":null,\\\"status\\\":\\\"published\\\",\\\"pinned_by_user_id\\\":null,\\\"restacks\\\":0,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Michael\\\",\\\"photo_url\\\":\\\"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a2eb040-e118-40b5-a79c-f01ad5503f4c_534x800.jpeg\\\",\\\"handle\\\":\\\"runtothehorizn\\\",\\\"reactor_names\\\":[],\\\"reaction\\\":null,\\\"reactions\\\":{\\\"\\u2764\\\":5},\\\"reaction_count\\\":5,\\\"children\\\":[],\\\"bans\\\":[],\\\"suppressed\\\":false,\\\"user_banned\\\":false,\\\"user_banned_for_comment\\\":false,\\\"user_slug\\\":\\\"runtothehorizn\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"is_author\\\":false,\\\"membership_state\\\":\\\"unsubscribed\\\",\\\"eligibleForGift\\\":false,\\\"author_on_other_pub\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Lux Umbra Dei\\\",\\\"id\\\":1262134,\\\"base_url\\\":\\\"https://runtothehorizn.substack.com\\\"}},\\\"country_blocks\\\":[],\\\"user_bestseller_tier\\\":null,\\\"can_dm\\\":true,\\\"userStatus\\\":{\\\"bestsellerTier\\\":null,\\\"subscriberTier\\\":1,\\\"leaderboard\\\":null,\\\"vip\\\":false,\\\"badge\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"subscriber\\\",\\\"tier\\\":1,\\\"color\\\":null}},\\\"score\\\":6,\\\"children_count\\\":0,\\\"reported_by_user\\\":false,\\\"restacked\\\":false},{\\\"id\\\":103201303,\\\"body\\\":\\\"One more thing for your list of things to do.
