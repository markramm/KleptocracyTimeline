McCoy for The New York TimesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: August 7Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 11Google Meet: August 12, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=header \ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Delayed a Medicare Change After Health Company DonationsWhat Happened: After Extremity Care gave $5 million to a pro-Trump PAC, its CEO used a Mar-a-Lago donor dinner to push Trump to block a Medicare rule cutting payments for its pricey skin substitutes. The next day, Trump promoted the company\u2019s flier, and a month later his regime delayed the rule\u2014preserving billions for the industry.Why It Matters: Another pay-to-play scheme in the open\u2014donors buy face time, get presidential backing, and secure profitable policy favors. Trump continues using the presidency as a tool for rewarding his biggest funders.Source: New York TimesJD Vance went kayaking for his birthday. Secret Service had the river level raised.What Happened: For JD Vance\u2019s 41st birthday, the Secret Service ordered higher water flow on Ohio\u2019s Little Miami River to accommodate motorized security craft during his family kayaking trip. The Army Corps of Engineers released water from Caesar Creek Lake. Why It Matters: This was a blatant misuse of taxpayer money as Trump guts health insurance and food assistance. It exposes the hypocrisy of a regime that preaches fiscal \u201crestraint\u201d while indulging in costly perks.Source: NBC NewsDemocrats sound alarm over Trump\u2019s reported $1bn plan to retrofit gifted Qatari jetWhat Happened: Top Democrats say Trump plans to divert nearly $1 billion\u2014partly from the over-budget Sentinel nuclear missile program\u2014to retrofit a $400 million jet gifted by Qatar into Air Force One, before later sending it to his presidential library.Why It Matters: Trump is trading U.S. nuclear readiness for a foreign bribe, merging national security with personal profit and showcasing corruption and foreign influence that is on steroids.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Demands Census Excluding Undocumented Immigrants Amid Redistricting FightWhat Happened: Trump ordered a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants, defying the Constitution to count all residents. The move is aimed at helping Republicans redraw maps before the 2026 midterms to secure long-term control.Why It Matters: This is an effort to rig representation by erasing millions from the count, shifting seats and resources to GOP strongholds. It\u2019s nationwide gerrymandering to cement Trump\u2019s hold on the Congress and power.Source: New York TimesTrump orders federal regulators to probe alleged bank \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against conservativesWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order directing bank regulators to investigate and refer cases of \u201cdebanking\u201d \u2014 closing accounts or denying services \u2014 against conservatives, gun makers, and crypto firms. The order also removes \u201creputational risk\u201d from bank safety metrics, a move that will weaken safeguards against doing business with high-risk or law-breaking clients.Why It Matters: This weaponizes federal regulators to protect Trump\u2019s political allies, criminals, and industries he favors, while gutting oversight tools meant to prevent financial crime. Source: Associated PressCongressional Democrats ask Trump administration to stop DOGE employees from moving into permanent positionsWhat Happened: Congressional Democrats urged Trump to stop unauthorized DOGE operatives from converting to permanent civil service roles after Musk\u2019s exit. Lawmakers warn DOGE operatives are spreading across agencies to \u201csabotage key functions\u201d and could violate laws banning political patronage. Why It Matters: Trump continues embedding loyalists into permanent federal jobs to lock in his control, dismantle neutral governance, and weaponize agencies as ideological enforcement arms.Source: CBS NewsVideo from Jan. 6 attack shows Justice Department adviser telling rioters attacking police to \"kill 'em\"What Happened: Newly released Jan. 6 bodycam footage shows Jared Wise\u2014now a Justice Department adviser\u2014shouting at rioters to \u201ckill\u201d police officers and calling them \u201cGestapo.\u201d Wise was charged in 2023 for his alleged role in the attack, but his case was dropped after Trump\u2019s blanket pardon for Jan. 6 defendants.Why It Matters: Trump has installed a Jan. 6 extremist into the Justice Department, putting someone who cheered on violence against police in a position of legal authority. It\u2019s a stark sign of how his regime is turning federal law enforcement into a safe haven for insurrectionists.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s redistricting fight mushrooms with Vance in Indiana and Florida joining the frayWhat Happened: Trump is escalating his push for mid-decade gerrymandering, sending JD Vance to Indiana and backing new efforts in Florida to redraw congressional maps in the GOP\u2019s favor. In Texas, Republicans are trying to force absent Democratic lawmakers back to vote on new maps, with Sen. John Cornyn using the FBI. Why It Matters: This is a coordinated GOP power grab to rig congressional maps mid-cycle. Trump\u2019s push guts fair representation, shreds democratic norms, and hardwires Republican control of the House before voters can have their say.Source: Associated Press\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsSenior Agent Who Helped Oversee FBI\u2019s Response to Jan. 6 Is FiredWhat Happened: Trump purged more top FBI officials, including former acting director Brian Driscoll and Washington field office chief Steven Jensen, who helped lead the Jan. 6 response. Both had resisted political pressure in Trump-related cases, part of a wider purge of agents tied to investigations he opposes.Why It Matters: This is an overt purge of career law enforcement to punish those who crossed Trump and followed the law. Trump continues dismantling independent institutions and intimidating federal agents.Source: New York TimesA CBP Agent Wore Meta Smart Glasses to an Immigration Raid in Los AngelesWhat Happened: A CBP agent was seen wearing Meta\u2019s AI-enabled smart glasses during a June 30 immigration raid in Los Angeles. Meta has no contract with CBP, and it\u2019s unclear if the glasses recorded, but experts say it reflects growing law enforcement interest in AI wearables.Why It Matters: Even a single use points to a shift toward AI-assisted surveillance in raids, heightening concerns over privacy, accountability, and intimidation in aggressive immigration enforcement.Source: 404 MediaCornyn Says FBI Will Help Find Texas Lawmakers Who Left StateWhat Happened: Sen. John Cornyn said FBI Director Kash Patel approved his request to help locate Democratic Texas lawmakers who fled to Illinois to block a GOP redistricting vote. Democrats called it political intimidation, noting there are no federal crimes or enforceable warrants out of state.Why It Matters: Using the FBI to pursue political opponents is another step in Trump\u2019s weaponization of federal agencies. Tactics tested on vulnerable communities are now being aimed at elected officials resisting GOP power grabs\u2014and will further expand.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsApple\u2019s CEO gives Trump a gift of glass and 24-karat goldWhat Happened: At a White House event, Apple CEO Tim Cook gifted Trump a 24-karat gold plaque before announcing a $100 billion U.S. investment. Trump praised Apple\u2019s expansion, exempted the company from his new 100% chip tariff, and showcased its Kentucky glass production plans.Why It Matters: The exchange highlights the transactional nature of Trump\u2019s economic policy\u2014where public praise, subservience, and high-profile gestures buy lucrative exemptions. It looked more like a scene from the Kremlin than the White House.Source: The Washington PostTrump Administration to Require Universities to Submit Data on Applicants\u2019 RaceWhat Happened: Trump ordered the Education Department to gather detailed admissions data from colleges \u2014 including race, gender, test scores, and GPAs \u2014 to police compliance with the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ban. The move builds on deals with Columbia and Brown, giving the regime broad access to information sought by conservative activists.Why It Matters: This data grab will chill diversity efforts and equip conservative groups to dismantle race-conscious policies. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s push to remake higher education, reduce minority representation, and enforce ideological conformity.Source: New York TimesBaltimore Schools Face Investigation Over Antisemitism AllegationsWhat Happened: Trump officials launched a civil rights investigation into Baltimore City Public Schools after an Anti-Defamation League complaint accused the district of failing to address antisemitic incidents. The probe follows similar actions targeting Chicago Public Schools\u2019 race-based achievement programs and rulings that California and Maine violated federal law over transgender sports policies.Why It Matters: The probe widens Trump\u2019s crackdown to K\u201312 schools, with districts risking federal funds unless they adopt Trump policies\u2014 reshaping curricula, admissions, and speech rules.Source: New York TimesTrump energizes conservative Christians with new religious policiesWhat Happened: In his first six months, Trump has rolled out policies favored by conservative Christians \u2014 banning federal support for gender-affirming care, cutting Planned Parenthood funding, letting pastors endorse candidates, and expanding religious expression in federal workplaces. He\u2019s created faith offices, appointed evangelical allies, and watched his Supreme Court picks deliver wins for MAGA on abortion, LGBTQ rights, and religious exemptions.Why It Matters: Trump is driving a Christian nationalist agenda that erodes church-state separation, embeds sectarian beliefs into law, and rolls back rights for marginalized groups \u2014 mirroring the religious nationalism Putin entrenched in Russia.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS Air Force to deny retirement pay to transgender service members being separated from the serviceWhat Happened: The Air Force will deny early retirement to transgender troops with 15\u201318 years of service, forcing them to take a lump-sum separation payout or be discharged without benefits. The move follows a Supreme Court decision allowing Trump\u2019s transgender military ban to proceed and comes despite earlier assurances to some service members that they could retire.Why It Matters: This is state-sanctioned discrimination that strips long-serving troops of earned benefits, compounding the harm of Trump\u2019s transgender ban. It\u2019s an act of open cruelty that dehumanizes service members who have risked their lives for the U.S.Source: CNNTrump orders colleges to prove they don\u2019t consider race in admissions as three UCs face probeWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order forcing colleges to hand over admissions data to prove they don\u2019t consider race, targeting UCLA, UC Irvine, and UC Berkeley amid federal probes. It follows $584 million in grant suspensions at UCLA over alleged race-based admissions, antisemitism, and transgender athlete policies.Why It Matters: This is another political assault on diversity in higher education, pressuring schools to strip even indirect consideration of race. It threatens to gut campus diversity and weaponize federal funding to enforce Trump\u2019s extreme ideological agenda.Source: Los Angeles TimesTrump plans to build largest US federal migrant detention center on military baseWhat Happened: Trump will construct a 5,000-bed migrant internment camp at Fort Bliss in Texas, making it the largest federal internment camps in U.S. history. The move expands Trump\u2019s aggressive immigration crackdown, with record ICE detentions and new facilities\u2014including the \u201cSpeedway Slammer\u201d in Indiana.Why It Matters: Using military bases to detain migrants militarizes immigration enforcement and underscores a long-term expansion of mass detention. It normalizes extreme measures, erodes civil liberties, and sets the stage for internment camp\u2013style facilities across the U.S.Source: ReutersHow Trump\u2019s executive order could criminalize homelessness: \u2018Terrifying\u2019What Happened: Trump\u2019s new executive order directs states and cities to clear unhoused people from streets, expand drug and mental health courts, and \u201cshift\u201d them into long-term institutions. Broad definitions of mental illness, substance use, and public safety risks could allow mass detention, while federal funding is cut for housing-first programs and harm-reduction services.Why It Matters: Critics say the order paves the way for detainment camps, strips civil rights protections, and targets cities that resist punitive crackdowns\u2014while doing nothing to address poverty or the housing crisis.Source: The GuardianTrump cuts threaten access to birth control for millions of womenWhat Happened: Trump is withholding Title X funds from reproductive health providers, cutting off free contraception for hundreds of thousands of low-income patients. Lawsuits say clinics were targeted over DEI statements, while Medicaid cuts and other policies threaten to shutter Planned Parenthood locations nationwide.Why It Matters: This is a coordinated rollback of reproductive rights, starting with the poor and marginalized. This is part of a broader attack on women\u2019s rights\u2014and these limits will spread.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFederal records contradict what FEMA leader told Congress about Texas flood responseWhat Happened: After the July floods in Texas, FEMA\u2019s call center funding lapsed for five days under a Trump rule requiring DHS sign-off. Only 10\u201320% of survivor calls were answered, contradicting Acting Administrator David Richardson\u2019s claim to Congress that most were handled.Why It Matters: Survivors were abandoned because of delays and FEMA cuts. Misleading Congress about it shows how they are breaking the system\u2014just as hurricane season gets underway.Source: NPRHarvard scientists say research could be set back years after funding freezeWhat Happened: Trump officials froze $2.6 billion in federal research funding to Harvard after it refused insane government demands on campus protests, academics, and admissions. The cuts have halted major projects, from multiple sclerosis to cancer research, forcing layoffs and shelving decades of work. Why It Matters: The freeze stalls lifesaving research and uses federal funding as a political weapon against universities that Trump targets. It threatens U.S. innovation, public health, and global scientific leadership.Source: Associated PressRFK Jr.'s vow to overhaul vaccine injury program echoes grievances of anti-vaccine movementWhat Happened: RFK Jr. plans to overhaul the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, calling it \u201cbroken\u201d and enlisting lawyers tied to anti-vaccine lawsuits. Critics fear Kennedy will expand coverage to unproven claims \u2014 including autism \u2014 which would bankrupt the fund and undermine U.S. vaccination programs.Why It Matters: Kennedy\u2019s overhaul advances anti-vaccine conspiracies, driving up vaccine costs, eroding public trust, and weakening America\u2019s immunization infrastructure.Source: Associated PressEPA cancels $7 billion Biden-era grant program to boost solar energyWhat Happened: Trump officials terminated the Biden-era Solar for All program, which aimed to fund rooftop and community solar for over 900,000 low-income households. Why It Matters: This kills a major climate and cost-cutting program, likely illegally, wiping out jobs, raising energy bills, and halting clean energy progress. It puts fossil fuel donors ahead of working families, weakens the grid, and locks the U.S. deeper into dirty energy.Source: Associated PressCivil Cases Against Major Polluters Plummet Under TrumpWhat Happened: In Trump\u2019s first six months, the DOJ filed just 11 civil cases against major polluters\u2014down from 30 under Biden. Staffing in environmental enforcement has dropped by a third, and the regime scrapped major lawsuits.Why It Matters: The decline signals to corporations that they can ignore environmental laws with little fear of consequences, leaving vulnerable communities exposed as protections are rolled back.Source: New York TimesUS national parks staff in \u2018survival mode\u2019 to keep parks open amid Trump cutsWhat Happened: Trump has purged a quarter of the National Park Service\u2019s permanent staff and is pushing a 30% budget cut, while ordering parks to remain open. Superintendents are running visitor centers, cleaning bathrooms, and covering for missing lifeguards, law enforcement, and conservation staff\u2014leaving behind critical ecological protection and safety work.Why It Matters: This is a Potemkin version of Trump\u2019s \u201cbest idea\u201d\u2014keeping parks open for show while letting them decay behind the scenes. The cuts endanger ecosystems, public safety, and historical preservation, turning national parks into political props instead of protected treasures.Source: The Guardian\u2018Impossible to rebuild\u2019: NIH scientists say Trump cuts will imperil life-saving researchWhat Happened: Trump has repeatedly moved to freeze or slash NIH grants, including for cancer and HIV research, while shifting control of the agency under political oversight. Officials warn the cuts\u2014paired with funding delays, grant cancellations, and reduced award rates\u2014will shutter labs, gut university research, and wipe out decades of medical progress.Why It Matters: Scientists say the strategy is designed to weaken universities and dismantle America\u2019s scientific infrastructure, risking breakthroughs in lifesaving treatments. Once dismantled, they warn, the research infrastructure that powers U.S. innovation will be nearly impossible to rebuild.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s push for drilling, mining sharpens debate for Alaska Natives about land they view as sacredWhat Happened: Trump is fast-tracking oil, gas, and mining in Alaska, including new Arctic Refuge lease sales and the Donlin Gold mine. Some Alaska Native leaders support the jobs and revenue, while others warn it will devastate salmon, caribou, and subsistence traditions.Why It Matters: The projects threaten irreversible environmental harm and centuries-old Native traditions, as Trump\u2019s agenda favors profit over Indigenous rights and cultural survival.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchRubio orders US diplomats to launch lobbying blitz against Europe's tech lawWhat Happened: Marco Rubio ordered U.S. diplomats in Europe to push for rolling back the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, calling it \u201ccensorship\u201d and a burden on U.S. tech firms. The directive urges envoys to collect \u201ccensorship\u201d cases affecting Americans and press to narrow the law\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal content.\u201dWhy It Matters: The move is trying to undercut Europe\u2019s fight against Russian, Chinese, and other disinformation operations and information warfare, shielding U.S. tech giants while aligning Washington with far-right parties opposing content crackdowns.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchThe covert trip by Iranian nuclear experts to RussiaWhat Happened: In August 2024, Iranian nuclear scientists tied to Tehran\u2019s weapons program secretly visited Russia to seek dual-use tech, including tritium for boosting nuclear warheads. The trip involved sanctioned individuals, tours of sensitive research sites, and meetings that would require FSB approval.Why It Matters: Russia has been actively assisting Iran\u2019s nuclear program, a reality now \u201ccoming\u201d to light\u2014from public reporting. Despite Israeli and U.S. strikes, this cooperation could rapidly advance Tehran\u2019s path to a bomb and destabilize the Middle East.Source: Financial Times via Moscow Times (No paywall)Russia and UAE double down on trade, testing U.S. limitsWhat Happened: UAE leader Mohammed bin Zayed met with Putin in Moscow, pledging to double trade to $23 billion in five years. The UAE has become Russia\u2019s key Middle East economic partner and a hub for sanction evasion, including dual-use goods, fueling Moscow\u2019s genocidal war in Ukraine.Why It Matters: Abu Dhabi\u2019s deepening ties with Russia undermine U.S. sanctions and bolster Putin\u2019s war economy. Trump has so far avoided penalizing the UAE, underscoring acceptance of his \u201callies\u201d that aid Moscow.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump's higher tariffs hit major US trading partners, sparking defiance and concernWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s new tariffs of 10\u201350% on imports from dozens of countries took effect, pushing average U.S. import duties to their highest in a century. While allies like the EU, Japan, and South Korea cut deals to lower rates, others\u2014such as Brazil, India, and Switzerland\u2014remain under steep tariffs and are vowing defiance, with some coordinating a BRICS response.Why It Matters: The erratic tariffs risk disrupting global supply chains, will drive up prices, and inflame tensions with major partners. By weaponizing trade policy for leverage, Trump is isolating the U.S. and pushing rivals toward closer alliances with Russia and China.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News9/1- Next National Day of ActionCheck out 50501 for local and nationwide events\u2026Source: 50501Judge Halts Construction at Florida\u2019s \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 Detention CenterWhat Happened: A federal judge issued a 14-day restraining order stopping construction at Florida\u2019s \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d migrant internment camp, after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued over habitat destruction and water pollution risks. The state and Trump officials argued federal law doesn\u2019t apply, but the judge questioned whether they were skirting environmental review requirements.Source: NPRJudge blocks Trump\u2019s birthright order nationwide in fourth such ruling since Supreme Court decisionWhat Happened: A federal judge in Maryland blocked Trump\u2019s order denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. Judge Deborah Boardman certified a nationwide class and ruled the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving the order violates the 14th Amendment\u2019s citizenship clause. This is the fourth ruling against the order since June\u2019s Supreme Court decision.Source: Associated Press\u2018South Park\u2019 Finds New Relevance Skewering the Trump EraWhat Happened: South Park is back in the political spotlight after lampooning Trump\u2019s second term, with episodes featuring Trump in bed with Satan discussing Jeffrey Epstein, Mar-a-Lago as \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d and ICE raids in heaven. By mocking power rather than submitting to it, shows like South Park keep space open for dissent and public critique.Source: New York TimesDemocrats respond to FBI agreement to locate Texas lawmakers: 'We will not be intimidated'What Happened: The FBI will help Texas authorities locate Democratic lawmakers who fled to block a GOP-drawn congressional map.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Pay-to-Play Governance \u2014 From Medicare policy delays to tariff exemptions, Trump\u2019s biggest donors are openly buying access and favorable decisions.Corruption Without Consequence \u2014 Extravagant perks for political allies reveal a regime that preaches austerity while looting public funds for insiders.Foreign Influence Pipeline \u2014 Trump\u2019s acceptance of costly bribes from foreign powers in exchange for policy shifts blends personal enrichment with national security compromises.Institutional Capture \u2014 Loyalist embeds, DOJ purges, and agency weaponization are dismantling neutral governance in favor of ideological control.Election Manipulation \u2014 Planned census changes, FBI intimidation, and mid-cycle gerrymanders are part of the GOP\u2019s attempt to hardwire political control before voters can act.Educational Reengineering \u2014 Data demands, funding threats, and ideological enforcement are erasing diversity in schools and universities.Religious Nationalism \u2014 Trump\u2019s faith-based policy agenda mirrors authoritarian models abroad, embedding sectarian law into U.S. governance.Civil Rights Dismantled \u2014 Targeted attacks on reproductive health, LGBTQ rights, and marginalized communities signal a broader rights erosion.Environmental Deregulation \u2014 Gutted enforcement and canceled climate programs prioritize fossil fuel donors over public health and safety.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.
