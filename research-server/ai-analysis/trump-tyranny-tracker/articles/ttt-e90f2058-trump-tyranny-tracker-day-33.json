  "content": "People protest during a rally outside the Treasury Department in Washington, Feb. 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 21Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsMusk Put Him in the Treasury Department. His Company Has Federal Contracts Worth MillionsWhat Happened: Tom Krause, CEO of Cloud Software Group, has been appointed the Treasury Department\u2019s fiscal assistant secretary while retaining his private-sector role. Cloud Software holds federal contracts worth up to $11.8 million, including deals with the Treasury.Why It Matters: This unprecedented dual role raises significant conflict-of-interest concerns, as Krause could influence federal contracting decisions that benefit his company, undermining ethical safeguards in government procurement.Source: WIREDU.S. could cut Ukraine\u2019s access to Starlink internet services over mineralsWhat Happened: U.S. negotiators are pressing Ukraine to agree to a deal on its critical minerals\u2014demanding 50% control in exchange for wartime aid. Sources say if Ukraine doesn\u2019t comply, the U.S. could cut off its access to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet, which is vital for military communications and drone operations.Why It Matters: Trump's threat to cut off Starlink\u2014a vital lifeline for Ukraine's military\u2014directly cripples its defense and serves as a blatant extortion tactic that reiterates his loyalty to Putin. This move not only undermines Ukraine's sovereignty but places the U.S. on Russia's side in assisting in its genocidal war.Source: ReutersDOGE\u2019s Millions: As Musk and Trump Gut Government, Their Ax-Cutting Agency Gets Cash InfusionWhat Happened: Elon Musk's unauthorized FAKE DOGE received nearly $40 million through the Economy Act to drive massive federal purges. Despite touting \"maximal transparency,\" its staffing and spending remain hidden as it slashes government programs.Why It Matters: This massive, opaque cash infusion enables Trump\u2019s purge of federal agencies, cutting vital services for partisan gains. By sidestepping standard transparency laws, DOGE\u2019s actions mirror authoritarian regimes where political loyalty overrides accountability and public interest.Source: ProPublicaUnder Trump, consumer watchdog drops case against online lenderWhat Happened: The CFPB, under Trump\u2019s control, has withdrawn its lawsuit against online lender Solo Funds, which it accused of misleading borrowers about loan costs. This marks the first case dropped since the agency\u2019s activities were frozen and staff were purged.Why It Matters: This signals a broader rollback of consumer protections as Trump dismantles the CFPB, leaving borrowers vulnerable to deceptive lending practices and undermining efforts to hold financial institutions accountable.Source: ReutersCoinbase Says SEC Intends to Drop Lawsuit Against Crypto ExchangeWhat Happened: The SEC intends to dismiss its two-year lawsuit against Coinbase\u2014a key part of its effort to regulate crypto as a stock exchange\u2014following the Trump regime\u2019s shift in crypto policy. Why It Matters: Dropping the lawsuit marks a blatant regulatory retreat that not only relaxes crypto rules but is happening as Trump, his allies, and his family profit at the expense of investor safety, exposing the market to higher risks and fraud.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Fires Joint Chiefs Chairman Amid Pentagon PurgeWhat Happened: Trump fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, replacing him with retired three-star General Dan Caine as part of a Friday night purge at the Pentagon. This was accompanied by additional dismissals of senior military officials and top legal advisors, all aimed at reshaping military leadership to align with Trump\u2019s \"America First\" agenda.Why It Matters: This unprecedented firing disrupts the longstanding norm of nonpartisan military leadership and risks politicizing the armed forces. By sidelining experienced commanders for politically loyalists, the regime endangers military readiness, national security, and undermines the credibility and stability of U.S. defense institutions.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\udea8 Pentagon Plans Mass Firings of Civilian WorkforceWhat Happened: The Pentagon announced plans to cut 5-8% of its civilian workforce\u2014up to 76,000 jobs\u2014with an initial 5,400 probationary employees set to be terminated next week. The decision, part of Trump's federal purge, targets non \u201cmission-critical\u201d roles to align with the regime\u2019s \"America First\" agenda.Why It Matters: This purge will undermine military readiness, as the Pentagon has not conducted the legally required analysis on how terminations could affect national security. The chaotic, rushed process mirrors broader efforts to hollow out federal institutions under an extremist agenda.Source: CNNTrump Fires Joint Chiefs Chairman and Top Pentagon Officials in Sweeping PurgeWhat Happened: Trump has ousted Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. including key judge advocates general for the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Why It Matters: This shake-up turns the military into a political weapon. Purging experienced officers\u2014especially JAGs who ensure legal and constitutional compliance\u2014undermines military judgment and oversight, endangering national security. It's a blatant move, echoing Trump's warnings that he\u2019d use the military against Americans.Source: Washington PostOCC Joins Wave of Federal Regulator LayoffsWhat Happened: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it is firing 76 probationary employees, effective March 8, as part of the Trump regime\u2019s broader push to reduce federal workforce numbers. This move follows similar layoffs at the FDIC and CFPB.Why It Matters: These cuts undermine regulatory stability by stripping experienced staff from key financial watchdogs, weakening oversight of the nation's banking system during a politically charged restructuring of federal agencies.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Executive Order Raises Alarm at the Federal ReserveWhat Happened: Trump issued an executive order allowing White House oversight of independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s regulatory functions, though excluding monetary policy. The order mandates a White House liaison in each agency, highlighting political interference in the Fed's bank supervision and crisis management programs.Why It Matters: This undermines the Fed\u2019s independence, a cornerstone of its credibility in financial markets, and will politicize bank regulation, weaken the Fed\u2019s role as an impartial economic steward, and pave the way for political pressure on future monetary decisions.Source: PoliticoPostal Service Braces for Potential Takeover by Trump's Commerce DepartmentWhat Happened: The USPS Board of Governors held an emergency meeting after Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick's confirmation. Discussions are underway on dissolving the board and merging the Postal Service into the Commerce Department.Why It Matters: This takeover would erode the USPS\u2019s constitutional independence, disrupt essential mail and e-commerce services, and threaten critical communication access, especially in rural areas, reflecting a broader trend of politicizing and privatizing federal institutions.Source: NBC NewsCIA Fires Officers Over Diversity WorkWhat Happened: The CIA has dismissed over a dozen intelligence officers for their involvement in diversity-related assignments. Some of the fired officers are now challenging the terminations.Why It Matters: This politically motivated purge undermines due process and federal workforce protections, reflecting how Trump\u2019s extremist agendas are infiltrating national security agencies and threatening their operational integrity.Source: CNNFBI Shuffles 1,500 Personnel Amid Trump-Patel ConsolidationWhat Happened: Newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel announced that 1,500 staffers from the Washington headquarters will be relocated to regional offices nationwide\u2014including 500 to Huntsville, Alabama.Why It Matters: This sweeping personnel shift is meant to create internal chaos and confusion, undermining the agency\u2019s stability as Trump and Patel tighten their grip on the FBI. The disruption will derail essential investigations and operational effectiveness and endanger the U.S.Source: The HillUS science agency reclassifies hundreds of workers as probationary, US lawmaker saysWhat Happened: Following an OPM mandate, the National Science Foundation reclassified hundreds of employees from permanent to probationary status\u2014effectively stripping both union and non-union workers of job security without proper notice. The agency also fired 170 employees recently, affecting nearly 10% of its workforce.Why It Matters: This reclassification undermines due process and labor protections, leaving essential science personnel vulnerable to arbitrary termination. It jeopardizes NSF\u2019s ability to fund and support vital research and will harm U.S. scientific progress.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Targets Maine Over Transgender Sports PolicyWhat Happened: Trump launched a civil rights investigation into Maine\u2019s transgender student sports participation policy after Governor Janet Mills refused to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports. The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is investigating specific school districts for alleged Title IX violations.Why It Matters: This investigation shows the regime blatantly weaponizing federal agencies to push its ideological agenda, crushing states\u2019 rights and the rule of law. It sets a dangerous precedent where political pressure overrides constitutional protections and erodes civil rights\u2014initiated just hours after Trump sparred with the governor, who retorted, \u201cSee you in court.\u201dSource: PoliticoTrump Imposes Conditions on California Wildfire AidWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s special envoy Richard Grenell announced that federal aid for California wildfires will come with conditions. He suggested tying funds to the elimination of the California Coastal Commission, calling it a \u201cdisaster\u201d and an obstacle to development.Why It Matters: This move weaponizes disaster relief to push a political agenda, undermining state autonomy and weakening environmental protections. It reflects the Trump regime\u2019s corrupt tactic of using federal funds as a tool to punish blue states and dismantle regulatory bodies\u2014echoing similar authoritarian strategies seen in Russia.Source: PoliticoMusk Ally Demands Access to Public Messaging SystemWhat Happened: Thomas Shedd, a Musk-aligned official overseeing Technology Transformation Services, demanded admin access to Notify.gov, a government system for mass texts. A GSA worker resigned in protest, warning Shedd's access would expose personally identifiable information, including phone numbers and details about recipients' participation in programs like Medicaid.Why It Matters: Unrestricted access to sensitive public data creates severe privacy risks, paving the way for state surveillance and abuse\u2014all in the name of fraud detection. This politicization of government systems under DOGE is dangerous and unacceptable.Source: 404 MediaJustice Department Shuts Down Federal Law Enforcement Misconduct TrackerWhat Happened: The DOJ has decommissioned its national police misconduct database, which tracked disciplinary records for nearly 150,000 federal officers. This move follows Trump\u2019s executive order rescinding 78 Biden-era actions, effectively halting the system that allowed agencies to check an officer's history before hiring.Why It Matters: Shutting down the database undermines transparency and public safety by preventing agencies from identifying \u201cwandering officers\u201d with histories of misconduct and abuses. This rollback removes critical due process protections and will allow officers with problematic records to slip between departments, posing a risk to Americans.Source: CBS NewsUS declares administrative law judge removal rules unconstitutionalWhat Happened: The DOJ will no longer defend the removal restrictions that shield administrative law judges, labeling them \"unelected and constitutionally unaccountable.\" This decision aligns with Trump\u2019s push to weaken federal regulatory agencies.Why It Matters: Removing these safeguards threatens judicial independence and opens the door to increased political interference in regulatory matters.Source: ReutersDOJ Accuses Judge Reyes of Misconduct in Trump Transgender Ban CaseWhat Happened: The U.S. Department of Justice filed a rare judicial misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes. The complaint alleges that during hearings on Trump\u2019s transgender military ban, Reyes used inappropriate language.Why It Matters: These allegations strike at the very core of our judicial system. Punishing Judge Reyes would erode public trust in the courts, politicize the legal process, and set a precedent for targeting judges who don't align with Trump's agenda.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsStaff at multiple agencies instructed not to speak to CongressWhat Happened: Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) sent letters to Agriculture, Interior, and EPA heads alleging that federal employees have been ordered not to communicate with Congress. This directive follows widespread firings, including at the U.S. Forest Service, and a steep decline in agency communications since Trump took office.Why It Matters: Blocking staff from sharing critical data with Congress shreds checks and balances, crippling oversight and allowing the executive to operate unchecked. This lack of transparency fuels long-term inefficiencies and directly harms public interests, especially in the management of natural resources and essential services.Source: The HillDOGE Sparks Surveillance Fear Across the US GovernmentWhat Happened: Federal employees across agencies report heightened fears of surveillance following Trump\u2019s workforce purges. Tools like Dynatrace and Splunk, once used for routine IT monitoring, are now seen as potential spying mechanisms under unauthorized DOGE. Anonymous threats targeting union leaders like Andrew Bernier, citing personal details possibly gleaned from work devices, further fueled paranoia.Why It Matters: The fear of surveillance is creating a chilling effect, discouraging whistleblowing and dissent while compromising worker privacy. This reflects how authoritarian regimes use technology to suppress opposition and consolidate control and this is exactly what happens in Russia.Source: WIREDMAGA Takes Aim at Republican HawksWhat Happened: Top Trump loyalists, including Vance and close aides of Donald Trump Jr., are clashing with the GOP\u2019s traditional defense hawks. They are sidelining established figures like Sen. Tom Cotton and former Gen. Keith Kellogg to reshape U.S. foreign policy along an America First agenda, prioritizing Trump\u2019s relationships over conventional alliances.Why It Matters: This move is authoritarian\u2014targeting and threatening traditional lawmakers to force them to toe a narrow foreign policy line. It undermines support for Ukraine, endangers U.S. national security and global leadership, and silences dissent under the extremist MAGA agenda. These tactics mirror those employed in Russia.Source: Politico\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Plans Military Detention for Undocumented ImmigrantsWhat Happened: Trump is expanding its detention capacity by repurposing military sites across the country. The plan includes establishing a deportation hub at Fort Bliss, Texas\u2014initially set to detain up to 1,000 undocumented immigrants, with potential expansion to 10,000\u2014and extending similar facilities nationwide.Why It Matters: This drastic militarization of immigration enforcement bypasses traditional ICE facilities, straining military resources and risking poor detention conditions. It marks a significant escalation in mass deportation tactics, raising serious human rights and legal concerns.Source: The New York TimesImmigration Crackdown Sparks School Absences in Boston AreaWhat Happened: More than 1,000 students across Boston-area schools stayed home in late January, fearing deportation raids under Trump's ramped-up immigration enforcement. ICE patrol rumors spread through WhatsApp, prompting students to skip classes rather than risk returning home to find their families gone. Teachers report that many immigrant children, especially from Brazilian, Haitian, and Guatemalan families, are too scared to attend school.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s policies are not just targeting undocumented adults\u2014they\u2019re destabilizing education for immigrant children, creating an atmosphere of fear in classrooms. Students are asking teachers about \u201cICE drills,\u201d and schools are left without clear protocols to reassure them. This fear is disrupting education and exacerbating inequalities in immigrant communities.Source: Mother JonesCBC Slams Trump Suspension of USDA 1890 Scholars ProgramWhat Happened: The USDA has indefinitely suspended the 1890 Scholarship Program\u2014designed to fully fund students from HBCUs pursuing agricultural and natural resource degrees\u2014pending further review. The decision comes amid broader executive orders gutting DEI.Why It Matters: Suspending this historic program undermines efforts to rectify systemic racial discrimination in the land-grant system, depriving black students of crucial educational opportunities and jeopardizing the future of the agriculture industry.Source: The HillBOP to Transfer Trans Inmates Under Trump OrderWhat Happened: The Bureau of Prisons is set to begin moving transgender inmates into facilities corresponding to their sex at birth\u2014regardless of their current placement or surgical status\u2014as early as next week. Why It Matters: The planned transfers will compromise the safety and rights of vulnerable trans prisoners, exposing them to higher risks of assault and interruption of essential treatments. This move undermines established protections under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.Source: NPRCensus Bureau Suspends Trans Rights Data CollectionWhat Happened: Following Trump\u2019s executive order targeting gender identity, the Census Bureau halted work on collecting and releasing statistics intended to protect transgender rights. The agency removed gender identity questions from key surveys and cut public access to data, stalling research on issues affecting the trans community.Why It Matters: Without accurate data on transgender populations, lawmakers and advocates lose a crucial tool for identifying discrimination and ensuring civil rights protections. This move undermines efforts to safeguard vulnerable communities and casts doubt on the integrity of federal data collection amid political interference.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchDOGE\u2019s USDS Purge Included the Guy Who Keeps Veterans\u2019 Data Safe OnlineWhat Happened: DOGE\u2019s mass purge included Jonathan Kamens, the cybersecurity lead for VA.gov, the primary portal for veterans' benefits and sensitive data. Kamens\u2019 firing leaves the site without a full-time security lead, jeopardizing critical protections for millions of veterans' personal and medical information.Why It Matters: With Kamens gone, VA.gov faces increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and data breaches, putting veterans\u2019 privacy and benefits at risk. This reckless cut reflects the broader dangers of politicized purges.Source: WIREDRecording Reveals New Details on Controversial DOGE EmployeeWhat Happened: A recording from 2022 captures a heated dispute at Path Network over whether 17-year-old Edward Coristine should remain on the job despite suspicions he leaked proprietary data. The CEO defended retaining him under strict conditions to prevent exposure to sensitive information. Now 19 and known as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d Coristine is a \u201csenior advisor\u201d at Elon Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, with access to high-level government systems and all of our private data.Why It Matters: This Musk operative appointment is a national security nightmare. His lack of experience and vetting while he has unfettered access to our most sensitive data\u2014is an outrageous danger posed by the Trump regime.Source: CNNTrump Pushes Out Top China Export Policy Official, Sources SayWhat Happened: Trump has forced out Matthew Borman, the principal deputy assistant secretary for export administration at the Department of Commerce, who played a key role in enforcing export restrictions on China. Why It Matters: Borman\u2019s removal erodes critical expertise in managing U.S. export controls, particularly those designed to limit China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductor technology and will compromise national security and economic strategy.Source: ReutersOutcry as Trump Withdraws Support for Climate-Related ResearchWhat Happened: Trump is cutting funding for scientific research that mentions \"climate,\" stripping grants from projects in the U.S. and abroad. This includes altering government websites, course materials, and rescinding previously awarded grants, forcing researchers to remove or retitle studies to avoid the banned term.Why It Matters: This stifles critical climate research and undermines efforts to address public health and environmental crises\u2014 echoing the tactics of authoritarian regimes that suppress inconvenient data.Source: Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump says he's had 'good talks' with Putin but not Ukraine as he escalates criticism of ZelenskyyWhat Happened: Trump stated he\u2019s had \u201cgood talks\u201d with Putin but not with Ukraine, accusing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy of lacking negotiating leverage. He argued that Ukraine \u201cdoesn't have any cards\u201d and again implied that the war wouldn\u2019t have occurred if he were president.Why It Matters: This rhetoric isn\u2019t just divisive\u2014it highlights that Trump is acting as a puppet for Putin. By shifting support from Ukraine to Russia, he destabilizes the Western consensus and undermines international efforts to counter aggression.Source: ABC NewsThe Christian Nationalist Driving Trump\u2019s PurgesWhat Happened: Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s newly confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget and Project 2025 architect, is quietly orchestrating mass federal layoffs under the guise of government efficiency. A devout Christian nationalist, Vought views his role as not just shrinking the state but reshaping it according to his ideological vision. Why It Matters: Vought\u2019s influence extends beyond budget cuts\u2014he\u2019s using his position to inject Christian nationalist ideals into federal governance while dismantling the administrative state. His rhetoric about \"traumatizing\" civil servants reflects the authoritarian mindset driving Trump's agenda.Source: VoxThird-Term Push for Trump Gains Ground at CPACWhat Happened: Shane Trejo, a GOP activist who co-hosted the far-right podcast Blood Soil and Liberty, is leading the \u201cThird Term Project\u201d at CPAC, portraying Trump as a modern-day Caesar. The effort aligns with Rep. Andy Ogles' bill proposing a constitutional amendment to allow Trump a third term.Why It Matters: This authoritarian push threatens constitutional limits on presidential power, echoing tactics used in Russia to consolidate control.Source: Mother JonesFar-Right French Leader Cancels Speech After Bannon Nazi SaluteWhat Happened: French far-right leader Jordan Bardella canceled his speech at CPAC after Steve Bannon, former Trump advisor, made a gesture described as a Nazi salute on stage. Bardella, head of France\u2019s National Rally, said the gesture contradicted the values he intended to promote and immediately withdrew from the event.Why It Matters: This incident underscores how Trump\u2019s far-right movement is pushing boundaries even European far-right extremist leaders find unacceptable.Source: France 24Far-Right Influencer Posobiec Gains Access to Trump Cabinet TravelWhat Happened: Jack Posobiec, a far-right activist with a history of promoting antisemitic and white supremacist content, has been invited to join trips with Trump Cabinet members, including a European trip organized by Defense Secretary Hegseth. He claims to have attended as part of a press delegation, though his participation underscores troubling ties between extremist figures and top government officials.Why It Matters: Posobiec's inclusion signals a dangerous normalization of extremist views within official settings and lends credibility to hate-fueled narratives. This mirrors tactics seen in authoritarian regimes, where political elites use such associations to legitimize their agenda and erode public trust.Source: NPRTrump\u2019s Kennedy Center to Host \u201cCelebration of Christ\u201dWhat Happened: Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s newly appointed Kennedy Center president, announced plans for a \u201chuge celebration of the birth of Christ\u201d as the centerpiece of the institution\u2019s December programming. This follows Trump\u2019s takeover of the Kennedy Center, purging the board and replacing its leadership with loyalists like Grenell.Why It Matters: This politicizes a historically nonpartisan cultural institution, pushing religious programming while sidelining events like the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus and other inclusive performances. It underscores how Trump is reshaping public institutions to align with his ideological agenda.Source: New York TimesJ6 Prison Choir Not Confirmed for Kennedy Center, Despite Bannon\u2019s ClaimsWhat Happened: Steve Bannon told the CPAC crowd that the J6 Prison Choir\u2014composed of men jailed for the January 6 Capitol riot\u2014would perform at the Kennedy Center under Trump appointee Ric Grenell. The Kennedy Center, however, denied any confirmed booking for the event.Why It Matters: Bannon\u2019s announcement highlights the Trump regime\u2019s effort to transform cultural institutions like the Kennedy Center into platforms for extremist narratives. It\u2019s another example of Trump elevating insurrectionists.Source: Los Angeles TimesFormer Proud Boys Leader Tarrio Arrested for AssaultWhat Happened: Enrique Tarrio, former Proud Boys leader, was arrested near the U.S. Capitol for allegedly striking a protester\u2019s phone and arm during a gathering with far-right figures, including Oath Keepers\u2019 Stewart Rhodes.

Sources say if Ukraine doesn\\u2019t comply, the U.S. could cut off its access to Elon Musk\\u2019s Starlink satellite internet, which is vital for military communications and drone operations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump's threat to cut off Starlink\\u2014a vital lifeline for Ukraine's military\\u2014directly cripples its defense and serves as a blatant extortion tactic that reiterates his loyalty to Putin. This move not only undermines Ukraine's sovereignty but places the U.S. on Russia's side in assisting in its genocidal war.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/us-could-cut-ukraines-access-to-starlink-internet-services-over-minerals-say-sources.html\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>DOGE\\u2019s Millions: As Musk and Trump Gut Government, Their Ax-Cutting Agency Gets Cash Infusion</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Elon Musk's unauthorized FAKE DOGE received nearly $40 million through the Economy Act to drive massive federal purges. Despite touting \\\\\\\"maximal transparency,\\\\\\\" its staffing and spending remain hidden as it slashes government programs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This massive, opaque cash infusion enables Trump\\u2019s purge of federal agencies, cutting vital services for partisan gains.

This marks the first case dropped since the agency\\u2019s activities were frozen and staff were purged.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This signals a broader rollback of consumer protections as Trump dismantles the CFPB, leaving borrowers vulnerable to deceptive lending practices and undermining efforts to hold financial institutions accountable.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/under-trump-consumer-watchdog-drops-case-against-online-lender-2025-02-21/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Coinbase Says SEC Intends to Drop Lawsuit Against Crypto Exchange</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The SEC intends to dismiss its two-year lawsuit against Coinbase\\u2014a key part of its effort to regulate crypto as a stock exchange\\u2014following the Trump regime\\u2019s shift in crypto policy. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Dropping the lawsuit marks a blatant regulatory retreat that not only relaxes crypto rules but is happening as Trump, his allies, and his family profit at the expense of investor safety, exposing the market to higher risks and fraud.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/coinbase-says-sec-intends-to-drop-lawsuit-against-crypto-exchange-4b3b0c36\\\\\\\">Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Fires Joint Chiefs Chairman Amid Pentagon Purge</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, replacing him with retired three-star General Dan Caine as part of a Friday night purge at the Pentagon. This was accompanied by additional dismissals of senior military officials and top legal advisors, all aimed at reshaping military leadership to align with Trump\\u2019s \\\\\\\"America First\\\\\\\" agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unprecedented firing disrupts the longstanding norm of nonpartisan military leadership and risks politicizing the armed forces. By sidelining experienced commanders for politically loyalists, the regime endangers military readiness, national security, and undermines the credibility and stability of U.S. defense institutions.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong>The New York Times</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDEA8 <strong>Pentagon Plans Mass Firings of Civilian Workforce</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Pentagon announced plans to cut 5-8% of its civilian workforce\\u2014up to 76,000 jobs\\u2014with an initial 5,400 probationary employees set to be terminated next week. The decision, part of Trump's federal purge, targets non \\u201Cmission-critical\\u201D roles to align with the regime\\u2019s \\\\\\\"America First\\\\\\\" agenda.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This purge will undermine military readiness, as the Pentagon has not conducted the legally required analysis on how terminations could affect national security.

Purging experienced officers\\u2014especially JAGs who ensure legal and constitutional compliance\\u2014undermines military judgment and oversight, endangering national security.

This move follows similar layoffs at the FDIC and CFPB.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>These cuts undermine regulatory stability by stripping experienced staff from key financial watchdogs, weakening oversight of the nation's banking system during a politically charged restructuring of federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-financial-regulator-occ-joins-other-agencies-firing-staff-2025-02-21/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Executive Order Raises Alarm at the Federal Reserve</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump issued an executive order allowing White House oversight of independent agencies, including the Federal Reserve\\u2019s regulatory functions, though excluding monetary policy. The order mandates a White House liaison in each agency, highlighting political interference in the Fed's bank supervision and crisis management programs.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This undermines the Fed\\u2019s independence, a cornerstone of its credibility in financial markets, and will politicize bank regulation, weaken the Fed\\u2019s role as an impartial economic steward, and pave the way for political pressure on future monetary decisions.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/trumps-plan-federal-reserve-00205526\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Postal Service Braces for Potential Takeover by Trump's Commerce Department</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The USPS Board of Governors held an emergency meeting after Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick's confirmation. Discussions are underway on dissolving the board and merging the Postal Service into the Commerce Department.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This takeover would erode the USPS\\u2019s constitutional independence, disrupt essential mail and e-commerce services, and threaten critical communication access, especially in rural areas, reflecting a broader trend of politicizing and privatizing federal institutions.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/postal-service-braces-potential-takeover-trump-commerce-department-rcna193291\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>CIA Fires Officers Over Diversity Work</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The CIA has dismissed over a dozen intelligence officers for their involvement in diversity-related assignments.

The agency also fired 170 employees recently, affecting nearly 10% of its workforce.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This reclassification undermines due process and labor protections, leaving essential science personnel vulnerable to arbitrary termination.

The Education Department\\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is investigating specific school districts for alleged Title IX violations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This investigation shows the regime blatantly weaponizing federal agencies to push its ideological agenda, crushing states\\u2019 rights and the rule of law.

He suggested tying funds to the elimination of the California Coastal Commission, calling it a \\u201Cdisaster\\u201D and an obstacle to development.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move weaponizes disaster relief to push a political agenda, undermining state autonomy and weakening environmental protections. It reflects the Trump regime\\u2019s corrupt tactic of using federal funds as a tool to punish blue states and dismantle regulatory bodies\\u2014echoing similar authoritarian strategies seen in Russia.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/21/california-wildfire-aid-conditions-trump-administration-00205479\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Ally Demands Access to Public Messaging System</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Thomas Shedd, a Musk-aligned official overseeing Technology Transformation Services, demanded admin access to Notify.gov, a government system for mass texts. A GSA worker resigned in protest, warning Shedd's access would expose personally identifiable information, including phone numbers and details about recipients' participation in programs like Medicaid.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Unrestricted access to sensitive public data creates severe privacy risks, paving the way for state surveillance and abuse\\u2014all in the name of fraud detection.

This move follows Trump\\u2019s executive order rescinding 78 Biden-era actions, effectively halting the system that allowed agencies to check an officer's history before hiring.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Shutting down the database undermines transparency and public safety by preventing agencies from identifying \\u201Cwandering officers\\u201D with histories of misconduct and abuses.

The complaint alleges that during hearings on Trump\\u2019s transgender military ban, Reyes used inappropriate language.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These allegations strike at the very core of our judicial system. Punishing Judge Reyes would erode public trust in the courts, politicize the legal process, and set a precedent for targeting judges who don't align with Trump's agenda.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-accuses-judge-reviewing-trump-transgender-military-ban-2025-02-22/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Staff at multiple agencies instructed not to speak to Congress</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) sent letters to Agriculture, Interior, and EPA heads alleging that federal employees have been ordered not to communicate with Congress. This directive follows widespread firings, including at the U.S. Forest Service, and a steep decline in agency communications since Trump took office.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Blocking staff from sharing critical data with Congress shreds checks and balances, crippling oversight and allowing the executive to operate unchecked.

Tools like Dynatrace and Splunk, once used for routine IT monitoring, are now seen as potential spying mechanisms under unauthorized DOGE. Anonymous threats targeting union leaders like Andrew Bernier, citing personal details possibly gleaned from work devices, further fueled paranoia.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The fear of surveillance is creating a chilling effect, discouraging whistleblowing and dissent while compromising worker privacy.

They are sidelining established figures like Sen. Tom Cotton and former Gen. Keith Kellogg to reshape U.S. foreign policy along an America First agenda, prioritizing Trump\\u2019s relationships over conventional alliances.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This move is authoritarian\\u2014targeting and threatening traditional lawmakers to force them to toe a narrow foreign policy line. It undermines support for Ukraine, endangers U.S. national security and global leadership, and silences dissent under the extremist MAGA agenda.

ICE patrol rumors spread through WhatsApp, prompting students to skip classes rather than risk returning home to find their families gone. Teachers report that many immigrant children, especially from Brazilian, Haitian, and Guatemalan families, are too scared to attend school.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s policies are not just targeting undocumented adults\\u2014they\\u2019re destabilizing education for immigrant children, creating an atmosphere of fear in classrooms.
