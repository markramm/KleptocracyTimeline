Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Luis Maga\u00f1a/APShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 4-6Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.I apologize for missing the Friday tracker and have included all the important stories in this weekend's tracker.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Just Pardoned \u2026 a Corporation?What Happened: In a highly unusual move, Trump issued a full pardon to HDR Global Trading, the parent company of crypto exchange BitMEX, which had pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws and was fined $100 million. The pardon came just before the payment deadline and included three of the company's co-founders.Why It Matters: Legal experts say this could be the first-ever full presidential pardon granted to a corporation, raising alarm over the precedent it sets. This further blurs the line between corporate accountability and political favoritism, especially as Trump rolls back enforcement actions across the crypto sector and he and his family enrich themselves with crypto.Source: The InterceptTrump Skips Honoring Soldiers Killed in Lithuania to Watch GolfWhat Happened: Trump chose to attend a Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his Doral resort in Florida rather than receive the remains of 4 American soldiers killed during a training accident in Lithuania. The dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base was attended by senators and military officials, while Trump sent Hegseth in his place so he could golf with the Saudis.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s absence reiterates his disrespect for military service and the American people, as markets plunge under his tariff regime. The decision to skip the dignified transfer of four fallen soldiers is reprehensible and disgusting.Source: Rolling Stone\u2018Oligarchy\u2019: Trump Exempts Big Oil Donors from Tariffs PackageWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s sweeping 10% universal tariffs unveiled Wednesday exempt many fossil fuel products\u2014including LNG imports, Canadian crude, and petrochemical inputs. The carveout came after the fossil fuel industry contributed $96 million to Trump\u2019s re-election effort.Why It Matters: Trump continues to be loyal to Big Oil amid global economic turmoil triggered by Trump\u2019s erratic policies. Consumer prices are expected to rise, but oil donors benefit\u2014highlighting an \u201coligarchic\u201d system where political access yields economic protection.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsJudge Says Deportation of Maryland Man to Salvadoran Prison Was \u2018Wholly Lawless\u2019What Happened: A federal judge slammed Trump for unlawfully deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, to a notorious prison in El Salvador despite a 2019 court order explicitly barring his removal due to threats of persecution. Judge Paula Xinis wrote that U.S. officials had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to arrest, detain, or deport him, and described their actions as \u201cwholly lawless.\u201dWhy It Matters: The ruling is a scathing rebuke of Trump's illegal deportation tactics.

Loomer later boasted about her influence, calling the firings a victory.Why It Matters: A conspiracy theorist with no official role influenced key national security hires. Trump\u2019s reliance on loyalist extremists over qualified experts highlights deep politicization and poses a grave danger to national security.Source: Military TimesDOGE Expected to Slash DHS Workforce, Including Secret ServiceWhat Happened: Musk is planning a major purge at the Department of Homeland Security, including at the Secret Service, FEMA, ICE, and CBP. Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to announce early retirements and voluntary separations in the coming days.Why It Matters: With the Secret Service strained and FEMA facing deep cuts ahead of disaster season, the purge threatens national security and public safety at a time of rising instability and threats.Source: CNNDOJ Lawyer Who Criticized Admin Over Maryland Man\u2019s Deportation Placed on LeaveWhat Happened: Senior DOJ immigration attorney Erez Reuveni was placed on indefinite leave after criticizing Trump\u2019s regime in court for deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite a judicial order prohibiting it.Why It Matters: Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s removal of a DOJ lawyer for following the law underscores a disturbing authoritarian tactic\u2014where loyalty to Trump trumps legal oversight, and dissent is punished, even when defending constitutional process.Source: The Hill\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions News\ud83d\udea8DOGE Plans IRS \u201cHackathon\u201d to Build Mega API, Raising Fears Over Taxpayer Data AccessWhat Happened: Musk is planning a weeklong hackathon at the IRS to build a \u201cmega API\u201d that would grant sweeping access to all taxpayer data. IRS staff say Musk operatives want to \u201crip up the old systems\u201d and fast-track a cloud-based interface. Software firm Palantir is being discussed as a likely third-party partner.Why It Matters: A centralized IRS API would hand Musk and his operatives\u2014and even private firms\u2014unchecked access to Americans\u2019 most sensitive financial data. Experts warn it\u2019s a dangerous consolidation of power, and may create an open backdoor into Social Security numbers, addresses, and tax records with no oversight.Source: WIREDDHS Officials Ask IRS to Use Tax Data to Locate Up to 7 Million ImmigrantsWhat Happened: The Department of Homeland Security has asked the IRS to share confidential taxpayer data\u2014including names and addresses\u2014to locate up to 7 million undocumented immigrants. The initial request targeted 700,000 people; it has since ballooned to potentially 7 million.Why It Matters: The IRS is legally bound to protect taxpayer confidentiality, and using tax data for civil immigration enforcement may violate federal law. The request signals a dramatic escalation in Trump\u2019s push to weaponize federal agencies\u2014one IRS officials are alarmed by.Source: Washington PostInterim U.S. Attorney for D.C.

Why It Matters: Comparing Jan. 6 prosecutions to Japanese internment is outrageous. Trump sycophants continue actively rewriting the history of their violent insurrection.Source: ABC NewsSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump\u2019s Third Term Talk Defies Constitution and Tests DemocracyWhat Happened: Trump has once again floated the idea of staying in office beyond the two-term constitutional limit, telling reporters he\u2019s not joking about a potential third term. His allies are brushing it off, despite this being a calculated move to normalize an authoritarian power grab.Why It Matters: Trump tried to violently overturn the 2020 election, called for the Constitution\u2019s \u201ctermination,\u201d and now continues to consolidate power at lightning speed. His talk of indefinite rule is a warning. This is how authoritarianism creeps in\u2014 through repetition, erosion of norms, and public exhaustion.Source: New York Times\u2018Everyone is terrified\u2019: Business and government officials are afraid to cross Trump on tariffsWhat Happened: Amid the economic fallout from Trump\u2019s trade war, lobbyists, business leaders, and even GOP lawmakers are too afraid to push back and are worried about retaliation from Trump.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s grip on power is stifling dissent and fueling a climate of intimidation. Officials and corporations fear becoming political targets, echoing autocratic tactics seen in places like Russia. The only path forward is coordinated resistance because appeasement only strengthens a dictator.Source: PoliticoRepublican Senator Suggests Violence Against Journalists Who Report \"Fake News\"What Happened: Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) posted a video on X suggesting reporters might write fewer \u201cfalse stories\u201d if violence were still used to settle disputes. He referenced an 1890 killing of a former congressman by a journalist, saying, \u201cI bet they would write a lot less false stories \u2014 as President Trump says, \u2018fake news\u2019 \u2014 if we could still handle our differences that way.\u201dWhy It Matters: Mullin\u2019s remarks are reprehensible and echo authoritarian rhetoric, normalizing threats and violence against the press\u2014 Putin murders journalists to silence the press.

An internal DOJ memo reveals the agency is marked for elimination as part of Trump\u2019s purge and dismantling of agencies.Why It Matters: The CRS has been a quiet but essential force for de-escalation during America\u2019s most volatile moments, from Rodney King to George Floyd. Shutting it down strips the DOJ of a trusted tool to prevent unrest, and risks more violent conflict between law enforcement and marginalized communities\u2014 which is probably the plan.Source: CBS NewsTrump Accidentally Tells Ukrainian Refugees to Leave U.S., Citing \u201cError\u201dWhat Happened: Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. under the Uniting for Ukraine program received a DHS notice this week falsely stating their legal status was being revoked and that they must leave the country within seven days\u2014or face deportation. The email also warned of work permit terminations and urged self-deportation via a government app. DHS later admitted the message was sent \u201cin error\u201d and retracted it.Why It Matters: The letter sparked panic among approximately 240,000 Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. who escaped Russia\u2019s genocidal war. While officials apologized, my question remains: when was that deportation letter prepared, and was it sent prematurely? Source: CBS NewsVenezuelans with Legal Status Illegally Detained in the U.S., Lawyers SayWhat Happened: Federal immigration authorities are arresting Venezuelans who hold Temporary Protected Status (TPS), despite laws that explicitly shield them from detention. Individuals are being picked up during check-ins, on the street, and even at home.Why It Matters: TPS is granted to people who cannot safely return to their home country. Lawyers call the arrests unlawful and say they reflect a breakdown in legal standards by Trump.Source: The GuardianMom, 3 Kids Detained by ICE in NY Operation Gov. Hochul Calls \u201cJust Plain Cruel\u201dWhat Happened: A mother and her three children were detained by ICE at a dairy farm near the U.S.-Canada border in New York. They were transferred to a detention facility in Texas..Why It Matters: New York Governor Kathy Hochul called the arrests \u201cjust plain cruel\u201d and demanded the family\u2019s return. Outrage is growing over Trump\u2019s aggressive tactics\u2014especially after reports that young children were handcuffed during the operation.

Despite holding a valid Advance Parole\u2014official permission to travel and reenter the U.S.\u2014Cortez-Martinez was stopped at DFW Airport and removed immediately to Mexico City.Why It Matters: Cortez-Martinez had renewed his DACA status lawfully since 2014 and was unaware of a 2024 removal order. A federal lawsuit was filed and this case  raises serious legal and human rights concerns.

The military later restored the pages, calling it a \u201cmistake.\u201dWhy It Matters: The purge sends a chilling message to Black service members. Kyle Bibby of the Black Veterans Project warned it's part of a broader effort to make Black Americans feel \u201cunwelcome or unsafe\u201d in military spaces.Source: The HillAmid anti-DEI push, National Park Service rewrites history of Underground RailroadWhat Happened: The National Park Service has revised its web pages on U.S. history, including removing references to slavery from the Underground Railroad section and replacing Harriet Tubman\u2019s photo with stamps emphasizing \u201cBlack/White cooperation.\u201dWhy It Matters: The changes highlight a sickening effort to rewrite the history of slavery and racial injustice. Dozens of National Park Service pages have been scrubbed to downplay Black Americans\u2019 struggles and erase systemic racism. It\u2019s a continued, reprehensible whitewashing of one of the nation\u2019s worst injustices by Trump, Republicans, and white nationalist extremists.Source: Washington PostMaya Angelou Memoir, Holocaust Book Among Those Pulled from Naval Academy Library in DEI PurgeWhat Happened: The U.S. Naval Academy removed 381 books, including Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and books on the Holocaust, civil rights, and gender studies. Why It Matters: The removal targets materials discussing race, gender, and social justice, including histories of feminism, the Ku Klux Klan, and books on racism. This marks another step in Trump's extremist agenda to reshape educational content \u2014 a tactic reminiscent of authoritarian regimes like Russia.Source: Stars and StripesVisas Revoked for Dozens of California University Students and AlumniWhat Happened: Marco Rubio revoked the visas of more than three dozen students and alumni from California universities, including Stanford and UC Berkeley. Rubio confirmed that at least 300 student visas have been canceled nationwide. Some of those affected have already been detained by ICE.Why It Matters: The revocations are politically motivated, targeting foreign-born students involved in activism.

Rubio accused South Sudan's transitional government of refusing to accept deported nationals from the U.S., prompting the unprecedented move. Visa issuance to South Sudanese passport holders will also be suspended.Why It Matters: This is the first time Trump has targeted an entire nationality for mass visa revocation, setting a dangerous precedent amid rising global migration crises. South Sudanese already in the U.S.\u2014including 155 people with Temporary Protected Status expiring in May\u2014now face deportation as their home country teeters on the brink of renewed war.Source: USA TodayTrump Deports Gay Asylum Seeker to Salvadoran Mega-PrisonWhat Happened: Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay Venezuelan makeup artist seeking asylum in the U.S., was disappeared to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

The child had no underlying health conditions and was hospitalized with complications before her death. The state has reported over 480 measles cases so far this year. RFK Jr. visited Texas following criticism of his response. Why It Matters: This is the second child to die from measles in the U.S. this year\u2014both were unvaccinated. The outbreak is spreading across the U.S. as RFK Jr. promotes vaccine conspiracies and fringe treatments, fueling hesitancy while doing nothing to contain the growing public health crisis.Source: BBC NewsU.S. Aid Team Fired While in Myanmar Earthquake Zone, Ex-Official SaysWhat Happened: 3 U.S. aid workers assisting with earthquake relief in Myanmar were informed they were being laid off while still on the ground, according to a former USAID official. Why It Matters: The terminations have crippled vital U.S. humanitarian efforts, with American aid workers now sleeping on the streets beside earthquake survivors. As over 3,300 have died and China and Russia expand their influence through aid, the U.S. retreat is a moral failure.Source: NBC NewsSocial Security Faces Thousands More Job Cuts Even With Service in TailspinWhat Happened: Trump and Musk are preparing to lay off thousands more Social Security workers, even after eliminating 7,000 jobs.

The remaining staff will be moved under the Chief Counsel's office.Why It Matters: Gutting a quarter of the IRS\u2014especially during tax season\u2014is reckless. Eliminating the civil rights office raises serious concerns about enforcement and oversight. This is another power grab under the guise of reform.Source: ABC NewsInside DOGE\u2019s AI Push at the Department of Veterans AffairsWhat Happened: A Musk operative, startup CEO Sahil Lavingia, attempted to inject AI-generated code into VA.gov systems and gained access to privileged developer platforms at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Lavingia, one of several Muskoperatives with no public sector experience, is part of a broader effort to \u201cdigitize\u201d the VA while purging tens of thousands of staff.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s unvetted operatives are embedding themselves in one of the most sensitive federal agencies\u2014responsible for the health, education, and disability benefits of 10 million veterans. Internal alarm is growing over potential vulnerabilities and the risk of untested AI rewriting public-facing code.

That Wasn\u2019t True.What Happened: RFK Jr. claimed he would rehire 20% of staff fired during last week\u2019s purge. Sources told Politico that no such rehiring is planned. HHS had already terminated 10,000 employees, following another 10,000 voluntary departures. Why It Matters: RFK Jr.'s lies misled the public about the fate of thousands of public health experts from the FDA and NIH. The chaos at HHS under the Trump-Musk regime has gutted critical health functions with no plan for recovery\u2014endangering the lives of all Americans.Source: Politico'Decapitated': More Top Vaccine Regulators Out at FDA, Threatening New ApprovalsWhat Happened: Following the forced resignation of Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA\u2019s top vaccine official, a wave of high-level departures and firings has hit the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the division responsible for vaccine and gene therapy oversight. Why It Matters: The loss of institutional knowledge and scientific leadership will paralyze the FDA\u2019s vaccine and biologics review process. The purge will delay approvals of life-saving therapies, just as global health threats are on the rise.Source: NBC NewsDoD Hiring Freeze Leaves Civilians in Limbo, Some Living in Hotels with Belongings OverseasWhat Happened: A month into a hiring freeze ordered by Hegseth, civilian employees at the Pentagon are stuck in bureaucratic limbo. Some have had their belongings shipped overseas, are living in hotels, and face unclear guidance on whether their job transfers will proceed. Despite exemptions supposedly allowed for in-progress moves, decisions are bottlenecked at Hegseth\u2019s office, and approvals have been slow or denied with little explanation.Why It Matters: The freeze is causing real hardship for DoD civilians\u2014financial, logistical, and emotional\u2014without clear policy or support. The chaos created by the Trump regime is a danger to U.S. national security.Source: Defense OneDOGE Arrives at Peace Corps, Set to Access Internal Systems: SourcesWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s operatives arrived at the Peace Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C. Staff have been instructed to assist Musk operatives in setting up internal accounts and providing access to agency systems.Why It Matters: The Peace Corps is the latest federal agency targeted by Musk for dismantling and purging. Staff fear the kind of dismantling seen at USAID could follow, threatening one of America\u2019s most iconic diplomatic and humanitarian institutions.Source: ABC NewsElon Musk's DOGE Cuts Critical Funding From U.S. Libraries, Officials SayWhat Happened: Trump and Musk, abruptly cut off key funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the federal agency that distributes library grants across the country. Dozens of state programs were informed that their grants were terminated, effective immediately.Why It Matters: The Institute\u2019s \u201cGrants to States\u201d program, worth over $160 million annually, is the largest federal support system for U.S. libraries. Officials say the cuts will devastate rural and underserved communities, which rely on libraries for books, internet access, job searches, and education. The move effectively guts a quiet cornerstone of American civic life.Source: CBS NewsTrump Eviscerates Maternal and Child Health ProgramsWhat Happened: RFK Jr. eliminated multiple maternal and child health programs as part of a sweeping HHS purge. The move cut 10,000 jobs, following a prior 10,000 slashed by Musk, gutting one-quarter of the department\u2019s workforce.Why It Matters: Pediatricians warn the health of U.S. children is at risk.

European Commissioner Maros Sefcovic visited China and signaled a desire to deepen ties, including restarting talks over tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s economic aggression is pushing Europe toward closer alignment with China. While China is leveraging the rift to increase its influence, Europe is left navigating the fallout of a fractured transatlantic alliance and the threat of a flood of cheap Chinese goods.Source: Washington PostGermany\u2019s Conservatives Sound Alarm Over Gold Reserves Stored in U.S.What Happened: With over \u20ac100 billion in gold reserves stored at the New York Federal Reserve, German conservatives are raising fresh concerns about their security. CDU lawmakers Marco Wanderwitz and Markus Ferber have called for inspections and renewed scrutiny, citing fears over Trump\u2019s hostility toward Germany and increasingly autocratic behavior.Why It Matters: For decades, Germany trusted the U.S. as a safe custodian of its gold. But with Trump targeting German industries, interfering in elections, and undermining the rule of law, even long-held certainties are now in question. Calls to repatriate the gold signal a growing rift between historic allies.Source: PoliticoCanada Warns Travelers of US Border Agents\u2019 Authority to Search Electronic DevicesWhat Happened: The Canadian government issued a travel advisory warning citizens that US border agents have the authority to search phones, laptops, and other devices without cause. Travelers who refuse to comply risk seizure of devices, entry denial, or lengthy delays.Why It Matters: This move follows increased electronic searches at US borders. The advisory underscores rising surveillance and risks for international travelers entering the US.

A proposal is expected Monday, with a vote by Wednesday.Why It Matters: This is the EU\u2019s first major countermove in a global trade war triggered by Trump. With China and Canada already retaliating, the EU\u2019s response will further isolate the U.S. economically and drive up prices for consumers worldwide. Trump\u2019s tariffs have hit 70% of EU exports\u2014over $580 billion worth\u2014fueling recession fears across multiple continents.Source: ReutersUK wealth managers say American clients are moving money to BritainWhat Happened: British wealth management firms report a surge in demand from wealthy Americans transferring assets abroad amid growing concerns over Trump\u2019s instability. Top firms like Rathbones, Schroders, and RBC Brewin Dolphin say U.S. clients are moving 5% to 50% of their wealth to the UK or Channel Islands, often through trusts to shield assets from future legal or political risks.Why It Matters: The exodus of American capital reflects deepening fears among the U.S. elite about domestic political and economic turbulence.

Haugh and multiple NSC officials, who else will be ousted for \u201cdisloyalty?\u201d Trump\u2019s inner circle is tightening\u2014and demanding ideological purity from the intelligence and defense community.\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policy is raising prices for Americans and destabilizing global markets. Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Authoritarian Power Consolidation \u2014 From loyalty purges in national security agencies to firing DOJ attorneys who follow the law, Trump\u2019s regime is aggressively replacing professionals with loyalists. The goal is clear: absolute control and zero dissent.\ud83d\udea8The Weaponization of Data \u2014 DOGE\u2019s IRS \u201chackathon\u201d and DHS\u2019s push to access tax records for immigration enforcement signal a terrifying trend: the regime\u2019s intent to repurpose confidential data for authoritarian ends, with little to no oversight.Civil Rights in Freefall \u2014 The closure of the DOJ\u2019s Community Relations Service, ICE arrests of TPS holders, and detentions of children show a full-scale assault on civil rights protections\u2014especially for immigrants, communities of color, and political dissidents.Rewriting History \u2014 The erasure of slavery and systemic racism from National Park Service pages and the removal of DEI-related books from military libraries reflect an Orwellian push to rewrite American history. This is white nationalist conditioning through censorship.Erosion of Global Trust \u2014 Allies like Germany and Finland are questioning America\u2019s reliability, calling for repatriating gold, and demanding clarity on troop levels. Trump\u2019s foreign policy is not just reckless\u2014it\u2019s driving wedges into the foundation of the global democratic order.Tech Takeover of Government \u2014 Musk\u2019s operatives are seizing control of IRS, VA, and Peace Corps systems. Their goal isn\u2019t modernization\u2014it\u2019s domination. With no public sector experience and opaque motives, their presence poses national security risks.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs. Share credible information with journalists, watchdogs, and legal experts. Silence enables authoritarianism\u2014see something, say something.Defend Press Freedom: Support independent journalism by subscribing to and sharing reporting that challenges Trump\u2019s power grab.Contact Lawmakers: Demand accountability for Trump and Musk\u2019s unchecked power and Trump\u2019s war on oversight.Protest: Join local and national demonstrations against Trump\u2019s authoritarian overreach, purges, and attacks on civil rights.Attend Town Halls: Confront lawmakers and demand answers about government purges, deregulation, and threats to constitutional rights.Stay Vigilant: Watch for court rulings, executive overreach, and attempts to rewrite the Constitution. Document everything.Mobilize for Action: Organize or join legal efforts and resistance movements to protect democracy and human and civil rights.Support Whistleblowers: Encourage legal defense funds for government workers facing retaliation for exposing corruption.Thanks for reading the Trump Tyranny Tracker.

This issue has so many items citing alarming developments that it's hard to know how to comment.  Trump's pardoning of a corporation and his continuing talks of a third term are very concerning.  Petty things like cutting funding to small libraries should make everyone angry. An American aministration even dreaming of withdrawing the troops from Europe is unthinkable.  The flight of money leaving the U.S as well as the continuing exodus of scientists as well as Germany possibly reclaiming its gold held here-  all bespeak a lossif confidence in a steadily weakening country.  It shouldn't have come to this, Olga.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft

The pardon came just before the payment deadline and included three of the company's co-founders.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Legal experts say this could be the first-ever full presidential pardon granted to a corporation, raising alarm over the precedent it sets. This further blurs the line between corporate accountability and political favoritism, especially as Trump rolls back enforcement actions across the crypto sector and he and his family enrich themselves with crypto.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://theintercept.com/2025/04/02/trump-pardons-corporation-bitmex-crypto/\\\\\\\">The Intercept</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Skips Honoring Soldiers Killed in Lithuania to Watch Golf</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump chose to attend a Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at his Doral resort in Florida rather than receive the remains of 4 American soldiers killed during a training accident in Lithuania. The dignified transfer at Dover Air Force Base was attended by senators and military officials, while Trump sent Hegseth in his place so he could golf with the Saudis.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s absence reiterates his disrespect for military service and the American people, as markets plunge under his tariff regime.

This is not economic nationalism\\u2014it\\u2019s economic destruction.</p><p><strong>Authoritarian Power Consolidation</strong> \\u2014 From loyalty purges in national security agencies to firing DOJ attorneys who follow the law, Trump\\u2019s regime is aggressively replacing professionals with loyalists. The goal is clear: absolute control and zero dissent.</p><p><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEA8The Weaponization of Data</strong> \\u2014 DOGE\\u2019s IRS \\u201Chackathon\\u201D and DHS\\u2019s push to access tax records for immigration enforcement signal a terrifying trend: the regime\\u2019s intent to repurpose confidential data for authoritarian ends, with little to no oversight.</p><p><strong>Civil Rights in Freefall</strong> \\u2014 The closure of the DOJ\\u2019s Community Relations Service, ICE arrests of TPS holders, and detentions of children show a full-scale assault on civil rights protections\\u2014especially for immigrants, communities of color, and political dissidents.</p><p><strong>Rewriting History</strong> \\u2014 The erasure of slavery and systemic racism from National Park Service pages and the removal of DEI-related books from military libraries reflect an Orwellian push to rewrite American history. This is white nationalist conditioning through censorship.</p><p><strong>Erosion of Global Trust</strong> \\u2014 Allies like Germany and Finland are questioning America\\u2019s reliability, calling for repatriating gold, and demanding clarity on troop levels. Trump\\u2019s foreign policy is not just reckless\\u2014it\\u2019s driving wedges into the foundation of the global democratic order.</p><p><strong>Tech Takeover of Government</strong> \\u2014 Musk\\u2019s operatives are seizing control of IRS, VA, and Peace Corps systems.
