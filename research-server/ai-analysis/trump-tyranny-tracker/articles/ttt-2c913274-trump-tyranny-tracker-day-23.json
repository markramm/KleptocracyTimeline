  "content": "Elon Musk takes questions from reporters as President Trump looks on in the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday.Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 11Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Freezes CFPB, Halting Big Tech RegulationsWhat Happened: Trump ordered a full work stoppage at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), halting investigations, lawsuits, and enforcement. Cases against Capital One, Walmart, and Cash App, along with new regulations on Apple, Google, and PayPal\u2019s financial services, are suspended.Why It Matters: The freeze shields corporations from scrutiny, allowing Big Tech to expand into finance unchecked. With Trump and Musk pushing to dismantle the CFPB, consumer protections will be gone. X will exploit the pause to grow its payments business without oversight.Source: WIREDTrump\u2019s PACs Paid Millions to Lawyers Now On Government PayrollWhat Happened: Trump appointed several of his personal attorneys, who were paid at least $35 million by his PACs, to key roles in his regime. Todd Blanche, now deputy attorney general, received nearly $10 million, while others, including Alina Habba, David Warrington, and John Sauer, were also rewarded with top positions.Why It Matters: Trump is filling the Justice Department with loyalists who once defended him, creating conflicts of interest and undermining independent law enforcement. This is an effort to shield himself from legal accountability while consolidating control.Source: ABC NewsTrump Seeks Ukraine War Deal in Exchange for ResourcesWhat Happened: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine to meet President Zelensky as Trump pushes to \u2018end\u2019 the war. Trump signaled openness to supplying Ukraine with more weapons\u2014but only in exchange for access to its rare earth minerals, oil, and gas, valued at $500 billion. Trump also hinted at ongoing communication with Putin but refused to disclose details.Why It Matters: Trump's proposal turns U.S. aid to Ukraine fighting for its sovereignty and democracy into a transactional deal, prioritizing financial gain over geopolitical stability. With Ukraine\u2019s most valuable resources located in Russian-occupied areas, this approach legitimizes Russia\u2019s illegal territorial gains. His secretive contact with Putin raises further concerns over potential backroom deals.Source: The Wall Street JournalMusk\u2019s Business Empire Thrives as Trump Guts OversightWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass firings at regulatory agencies have stalled over 30 investigations into Musk\u2019s companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink. Agencies like the SEC, NLRB, and FAA, which oversee Musk\u2019s businesses, are now leaderless or controlled by Trump cronies.Why It Matters: With oversight collapsing, Musk benefits from unchecked federal contracts while holding unprecedented power over government spending and agencies. This blurs the line between corporate interests and state power, accelerating corruption.Source: The New York Times\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Moves to Gut Banking Regulators Without CongressWhat Happened: Trump plans to merge the FDIC and OCC under the Treasury Department, bypassing Congress. This follows the shutdown of the CFPB and broader efforts to slash financial oversight. Staff cuts and regulatory rollbacks are expected, shifting power to political appointees.Why It Matters: Centralizing control over banking regulators weakens financial oversight, increasing corruption and economic instability. With fewer safeguards, Wall Street gains unchecked power, endangering consumers and financial stability.Source: The Wall Street JournalTrump Fires USAID Inspector General After Critical ReportWhat Happened: Trump fired USAID Inspector General Paul K. Martin just one day after his office released a damning report warning that $489 million in food aid was at risk due to Trump\u2019s aid freeze. Martin was dismissed via email, violating a law requiring Congress to be notified 30 days in advance of such removals.Why It Matters: This is a continued direct attack on independent oversight and officials who scrutinize Trump\u2019s policies will be eliminated. With USAID already gutted by layoffs and an aid freeze, removing its watchdog worsens the crisis, putting millions at risk. By purging inspectors general, Trump gains unchecked control increasing risks of fraud and political misuse.Source: The Washington PostTrump Fires Top Labor Official Amid Crackdown on Worker ProtectionsWhat Happened: Trump has fired Susan Tsui Grundmann, chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), continuing his purge of labor officials. The FLRA oversees labor relations for 2.1 million federal employees.Why It Matters: The firing, which may violate legal protections against Trump\u2019s unilateral removal of FLRA board members, signals his broader push to weaken federal labor protections. Legal challenges are mounting as the regime consolidates control over independent labor agencies.Source: The GuardianTrump removes career DOJ official as head of national security divisionWhat Happened: Trump removed Devin DeBacker as acting head of the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division after just weeks in the role, replacing him with Sue Bai. No reason was given, and the move follows Trump\u2019s purge of independent officials across federal agencies.Why It Matters: This continues Trump\u2019s pattern of sidelining career professionals and replacing them with loyalists, raising concerns about political control over national security. Weakening independent oversight risks politicizing counterterrorism, espionage enforcement, and U.S. sanctions, prioritizing Trump\u2019s interests over national security.Source: ABC NewsMusk Ally \u2018Mistakenly\u2019 Had Power to Alter Treasury PaymentsWhat Happened: Treasury officials admitted Marko Elez, a Musk-backed ex-SpaceX engineer, was \u201cmistakenly\u201d given the ability to alter the federal payments system, which handles $5 trillion annually. Meant to have \u201cread-only\u201d access, Elez resigned after racist posts surfaced and was rehired. Why It Matters: Despite Trump\u2019s claims of limited access, Musk\u2019s operatives could interfere with government payments, including foreign aid. This breach highlights Musk\u2019s unchecked power and the serious national security risks of private actors manipulating federal funds.Source: PoliticoMusk\u2019s Team Slashes Education Dept. Budget, Faces Legal PushbackWhat Happened: Musk slashed $900 million from the Education Department, canceling 89 contracts and 29 diversity-related grants. Cuts target education research, including student learning and school safety. A federal judge temporarily restricted fake DOGE\u2019s access to student data over privacy concerns.Why It Matters: The cuts cripple education research and student support programs, including for disabled students. Musk\u2019s unchecked power is dismantling public education infrastructure, another Project 2025 goal. Source: The New York TimesTrump Orders \u2018Large Scale\u2019 Federal Work Force Cuts, Expands Musk\u2019s AuthorityWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to plan for mass federal workforce reductions and granted Elon Musk sweeping power over future hiring. The order mandates that most agencies can only hire one employee for every four departures and must consult Musk\u2019s team before making new career hires.Why It Matters: This is a drastic restructuring of the federal government, centralizing hiring power under Musk and stripping agencies of control over their own workforce. The move accelerates Trump\u2019s efforts to gut the civil service, replacing them with loyalists.Source: The New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Targets FBI Recruits in Purge of Law EnforcementWhat Happened: Trump ordered the FBI to provide a list of probationary employees, escalating fears of mass firings. The move follows a broader effort to purge officials involved in Jan. 6 investigations, with Trump appointees already forcing out senior leadership and installing loyalists, including an Elon Musk associate.Why It Matters: This is a clear attempt to reshape the FBI into a political tool, removing independent law enforcement officials and replacing them with Trump-aligned figures. The chilling effect is already crippling federal law enforcement, creating internal chaos and undermining national security.Source: NBC NewsMusk and Trump Escalate Attacks on JudiciaryWhat Happened: Musk and Trump lashed out at judges blocking key policies, with Musk calling for impeachment and claiming a \"judicial coup.\" Trump suggested judges were obstructing his agenda, while courts ruled against his spending freeze. Why It Matters: Attacks on the judiciary undermine legal oversight, fueling fears Trump may defy court rulings. With rising threats against judges and Democratic AGs preparing countermeasures, judicial independence is in danger.Source: ReutersTrump Purges Federal Election Security OfficialsWhat Happened: Trump placed 17 CISA election security staffers on leave, stripping state and local election offices of federal cybersecurity support. The sidelined officials had worked to counter cyber threats, foreign interference, and disinformation.Why It Matters: This purge cripples federal election security, making U.S. elections more vulnerable to foreign manipulation. Trump has long attacked CISA for debunking his election fraud claims\u2014this move cements his control by removing watchdogs and eliminating oversight.Source: ABC NewsDept of Education Moves to Erase Transgender Athletes\u2019 RecordsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s Department of Education has ordered the NCAA and high school sports federations to erase records, titles, and awards won by transgender athletes competing in female categories. The move follows Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender participation in women\u2019s sports, prompting the NCAA to revise its policies.Why It Matters: This is a sweeping rollback of rights for transgender athletes, aligning sports policy with the regime\u2019s broader crackdown on gender identity recognition. By retroactively stripping achievements, the regime sets a precedent for erasing trans inclusion from public records, fueling legal and civil rights battles. This tactic suggests that Trump will continue to weaponize agencies and erase any data he chooses.Source: Associated PressSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump FBI Pick Accused of Secretly Ordering PurgesWhat Happened: Sen. Dick Durbin accused Trump\u2019s FBI nominee, Kash Patel, of secretly orchestrating mass firings at the FBI while publicly denying involvement. Whistleblowers allege Patel issued orders via the White House to remove agents tied to Trump investigations, including Jan. 6 cases.Why It Matters: Patel may have perjured himself under oath, but more critically, his actions mirror authoritarian purges\u2014gutting independent law enforcement to install loyalists. Trump\u2019s dismantling of the FBI signals a full-blown weaponization of justice to serve his regime.Source: NBC NewsTrump Blocks AP Reporter Over Refusal to Use \u2018Gulf of America\u2019What Happened: Trump barred an AP reporter from an Oval Office event after the outlet refused to use \"Gulf of America\" instead of \"Gulf of Mexico.\" AP rejected the name change, calling it lacking international authority.Why It Matters: This move is an authoritarian attack on press freedom, punishing journalists for noncompliance and refusing to disseminate Trump\u2019s propaganda.Source: CBS NewsPBS Eliminates DEI Office Under Trump PressureWhat Happened: PBS shut down its DEI office and let go of its staff, citing compliance with Trump\u2019s executive order banning DEI initiatives. The move comes as PBS faces an FCC investigation led by Trump-appointed Chairman Brendan Carr, a key figure in Project 2025, which seeks to cut public broadcasting funding.Why It Matters: By pressuring PBS, his regime is weaponizing federal oversight to dismantle DEI efforts, suppress independent journalism, and impose ideological control over public media.Source: NPRTrump White House to Keep Visitor Logs SecretWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s regime announced it would not release White House visitor logs during his second term, continuing his first-term policy. Unlike Biden, who published records monthly, Trump officials argue they are not required to disclose the logs under the Presidential Records Act.Why It Matters: Hiding visitor records shields influence from lobbyists, foreign entities, and donors. With Trump\u2019s purge of oversight, this secrecy raises alarms over accountability and government transparency.Source: Fox NewsFEMA Official Defies Court Order, Freezes Grants as Trump Escalates War on Federal AgenciesWhat Happened: A senior FEMA official froze grant funding despite a court ruling ordering aid restoration. This follows Trump\u2019s push to dismantle FEMA, firing four officials for alleged disloyalty. Musk, overseeing budget cuts, echoed Trump\u2019s attacks, claiming FEMA misused $59 million on migrant housing. Trump now calls for FEMA\u2019s complete shutdown.Why It Matters: Defying court rulings signals a constitutional crisis as Trump weaponizes agencies. The FEMA purge aligns with Musk\u2019s push to gut oversight, leaving states vulnerable to disasters without federal aid.Source: NBC News\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Orders Military to Erase Webpages on Women\u2019s ServiceWhat Happened: The Army and Navy have removed webpages highlighting the contributions of female service members to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order eliminating DEI programs. The Navy\u2019s \u201cWomen of Courage and Intelligence\u201d page and the Army\u2019s \u201cWomen in Army History\u201d section were taken down, though some pages have been re-uploaded after backlash.Why It Matters: Erasing the history of women in the military is part of a broader effort to rewrite history and further marginalize service members who have historically fought for recognition. This move aligns with the regime\u2019s larger purge of diversity initiatives across government agencies, reinforcing a rigid ideological agenda at the expense of historical accuracy.Source: Military TimesUS aid freeze sets back fight against human trafficking in CambodiaWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s foreign aid freeze has forced shelters and rescue organizations fighting human trafficking in Cambodia to scale back or shut down. Victims of forced labor and scam operations, many lured under false pretenses, now have nowhere to turn as funding for rescues and shelters is cut off.Why It Matters: The freeze abandons victims trapped in exploitative forced labor schemes, including those targeting Americans. By crippling anti-trafficking efforts, the regime is enabling criminal networks to expand, undermining U.S. commitments to combat modern slavery while further isolating vulnerable populations.Source: Associated PressTrump Moves to Weaken Federal Worker ProtectionsWhat Happened: Trump submitted draft regulations to strip civil service protections from career federal employees involved in policy, making it easier to fire those seen as obstructing Trump\u2019s agenda. Why It Matters: This paves the way for a purge of nonpartisan civil servants, replacing them with loyalists. It centralizes presidential power over government agencies, eroding institutional independence and accelerating Trump\u2019s grip over the federal workforce. Source: PoliticoMilitary Ends Recruiting at Prestigious Black Engineering EventWhat Happened: The Army and other military branches have dropped recruiting efforts at the Black Engineer of the Year Awards, a key event for STEM talent. This follows Trump\u2019s purge of diversity initiatives in the military.Why It Matters: The decision cuts off the military from a pipeline of highly qualified Black engineers, weakening efforts to attract top technical talent. It underscores the regime\u2019s extremist agenda and will potentially harm military readiness and innovation.Source: Military.com\ud83c\udf10 Imperial WatchGOP Lawmaker Proposes Renaming Greenland \u2018Red, White, and Blueland\u2019What Happened: Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) introduced the \"Red, White, and Blueland Act of 2025,\" proposing to rename Greenland and authorizing Trump to negotiate its acquisition from Denmark. The bill directs the Interior Secretary to enforce the name change on official maps and documents.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s push to rename and acquire Greenland signals broader imperial ambitions, including past remarks on annexing Canada, stealing Gaza, and reclaiming the Panama Canal. Denmark and Greenland strongly oppose U.S. control, escalating geopolitical tensions and straining diplomatic relations with a NATO ally. Source: The HillTrump\u2019s Gaza Plan Mirrors Imperialist Playbook, Echoes Putin\u2019s Land GrabsWhat Happened: Trump doubled down on his plan to \u201cown\u201d and \u201ccherish\u201d Gaza, openly proposing the U.S. take control of the territory, remove Palestinians, and redevelop it into a \u2018luxury\u2019 destination. Ignoring Jordan\u2019s objections, Trump insisted Palestinians should lose their land and be relocated to third countries and suggested he could pressure Jordan and Egypt by withholding U.S. aid.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s rhetoric mirrors imperialist land grabs, treating Gaza as real estate for U.S. control while displacing its population. His vision\u2014a forced resettlement followed by Western redevelopment\u2014parallels Putin\u2019s annexation of Ukrainian territory under the guise of \u201cstabilization.\u201dSource: CNN\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsJudge Orders HHS, CDC, and FDA to Restore Deleted Health WebpagesWhat Happened: A federal judge ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration to restore deleted webpages containing crucial health information. The agencies had removed the content in compliance with Trump\u2019s executive order banning \u201cgender ideology.\u201d The ruling grants a temporary restraining order in response to a lawsuit from Doctors for America, which argued the deletions violated federal law and endangered patient care.Source: CBS NewsAppeals Court Denies Trump Admin's Request to Maintain Funding FreezeWhat Happened: A federal appeals court rejected Trump\u2019s attempt to block a judge\u2019s order requiring the immediate unfreezing of federal grants. The court ruled that the Justice Department failed to demonstrate specific harm from lifting the freeze.Source: The HillWatchdog Sues DOJ for Trump Classified Docs Report, Questions FBI Nominee Kash PatelWhat Happened: American Oversight has filed an emergency lawsuit demanding the release of Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents. The report could shed light on Kash Patel\u2019s involvement and whether he misled the public about Trump\u2019s declassification claims.

investigations, lawsuits, and enforcement. Cases against Capital One, Walmart, and Cash App, along with new regulations on Apple, Google, and PayPal\u2019s financial services, are suspended.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> The freeze shields corporations from scrutiny, allowing Big Tech to expand into finance unchecked. With Trump and Musk pushing to dismantle the CFPB, consumer protections will be gone.

Todd Blanche, now deputy attorney general, received nearly $10 million, while others, including Alina Habba, David Warrington, and John Sauer, were also rewarded with top positions.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Trump is filling the Justice Department with loyalists who once defended him, creating conflicts of interest and undermining independent law enforcement.

Trump signaled openness to supplying Ukraine with more weapons\u2014but only in exchange for access to its rare earth minerals, oil, and gas, valued at $500 billion. Trump also hinted at ongoing communication with Putin but refused to disclose details.</span></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><span> Trump's proposal turns U.S. aid to Ukraine fighting for its sovereignty and democracy into a transactional deal, prioritizing financial gain over geopolitical stability. With Ukraine\u2019s most valuable resources located in Russian-occupied areas, this approach legitimizes Russia\u2019s illegal territorial gains.

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 11</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Freezes CFPB, Halting Big Tech Regulations</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered a full work stoppage at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), halting investigations, lawsuits, and enforcement. Cases against Capital One, Walmart, and Cash App, along with new regulations on Apple, Google, and PayPal\\u2019s financial services, are suspended.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The freeze shields corporations from scrutiny, allowing Big Tech to expand into finance unchecked. With Trump and Musk pushing to dismantle the CFPB, consumer protections will be gone. X will exploit the pause to grow its payments business without oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-trump-freeze-tech-investigations/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s PACs Paid Millions to Lawyers Now On Government Payroll</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump appointed several of his personal attorneys, who were paid at least $35 million by his PACs, to key roles in his regime. Todd Blanche, now deputy attorney general, received nearly $10 million, while others, including Alina Habba, David Warrington, and John Sauer, were also rewarded with top positions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is filling the Justice Department with loyalists who once defended him, creating conflicts of interest and undermining independent law enforcement. This is an effort to shield himself from legal accountability while consolidating control.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-administration-officials-trumps-personal-attorneys-paid-millions/story?id=118702187\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Seeks Ukraine War Deal in Exchange for Resources</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will visit Ukraine to meet President Zelensky as Trump pushes to \\u2018end\\u2019 the war. Trump signaled openness to supplying Ukraine with more weapons\\u2014but only in exchange for access to its rare earth minerals, oil, and gas, valued at $500 billion. Trump also hinted at ongoing communication with Putin but refused to disclose details.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump's proposal turns U.S. aid to Ukraine fighting for its sovereignty and democracy into a transactional deal, prioritizing financial gain over geopolitical stability. With Ukraine\\u2019s most valuable resources located in Russian-occupied areas, this approach legitimizes Russia\\u2019s illegal territorial gains. His secretive contact with Putin raises further concerns over potential backroom deals.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/treasury-secretary-bessent-to-meet-with-zelensky-in-ukraine-f1722f52?mod=politics_lead_pos1\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s Business Empire Thrives as Trump Guts Oversight</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s mass firings at regulatory agencies have stalled over 30 investigations into Musk\\u2019s companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, and Neuralink. Agencies like the SEC, NLRB, and FAA, which oversee Musk\\u2019s businesses, are now leaderless or controlled by Trump cronies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With oversight collapsing, Musk benefits from unchecked federal contracts while holding unprecedented power over government spending and agencies. This blurs the line between corporate interests and state power, accelerating corruption.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/elon-musk-companies-conflicts.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Moves to Gut Banking Regulators Without Congress</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump plans to merge the FDIC and OCC under the Treasury Department, bypassing Congress. This follows the shutdown of the CFPB and broader efforts to slash financial oversight. Staff cuts and regulatory rollbacks are expected, shifting power to political appointees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Centralizing control over banking regulators weakens financial oversight, increasing corruption and economic instability. With fewer safeguards, Wall Street gains unchecked power, endangering consumers and financial stability.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/trump-advisers-eye-bank-regulator-consolidation-after-targeting-cfpb-85055a2e?mod=hp_lead_pos3\\\\\\\">The Wall Street Journal</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires USAID Inspector General After Critical Report</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired USAID Inspector General Paul K. Martin just one day after his office released a damning report warning that $489 million in food aid was at risk due to Trump\\u2019s aid freeze. Martin was dismissed via email, violating a law requiring Congress to be notified 30 days in advance of such removals.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a continued direct attack on independent oversight and officials who scrutinize Trump\\u2019s policies will be eliminated. With USAID already gutted by layoffs and an aid freeze, removing its watchdog worsens the crisis, putting millions at risk. By purging inspectors general, Trump gains unchecked control increasing risks of fraud and political misuse.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/11/trump-fires-usaid-inspector-general/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires Top Labor Official Amid Crackdown on Worker Protections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has fired Susan Tsui Grundmann, chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), continuing his purge of labor officials. The FLRA oversees labor relations for 2.1 million federal employees.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The firing, which may violate legal protections against Trump\\u2019s unilateral removal of FLRA board members, signals his broader push to weaken federal labor protections. Legal challenges are mounting as the regime consolidates control over independent labor agencies.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/trump-labor-flra-firing\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Trump removes career DOJ official as head of national security division</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump removed Devin DeBacker as acting head of the DOJ\\u2019s National Security Division after just weeks in the role, replacing him with Sue Bai. No reason was given, and the move follows Trump\\u2019s purge of independent officials across federal agencies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This continues Trump\\u2019s pattern of sidelining career professionals and replacing them with loyalists, raising concerns about political control over national security. Weakening independent oversight risks politicizing counterterrorism, espionage enforcement, and U.S. sanctions, prioritizing Trump\\u2019s interests over national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-administration-removes-acting-head-dojs-national-security/story?id=118695212\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk Ally \\u2018Mistakenly\\u2019 Had Power to Alter Treasury Payments</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Treasury officials admitted Marko Elez, a Musk-backed ex-SpaceX engineer, was \\u201Cmistakenly\\u201D given the ability to alter the federal payments system, which handles $5 trillion annually. Meant to have \\u201Cread-only\\u201D access, Elez resigned after racist posts surfaced and was rehired. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Despite Trump\\u2019s claims of limited access, Musk\\u2019s operatives could interfere with government payments, including foreign aid. This breach highlights Musk\\u2019s unchecked power and the serious national security risks of private actors manipulating federal funds.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/musk-ally-mistakenly-power-alter-payments-system-00203714\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s Team Slashes Education Dept. Budget, Faces Legal Pushback</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk slashed $900 million from the Education Department, canceling 89 contracts and 29 diversity-related grants. Cuts target education research, including student learning and school safety. A federal judge temporarily restricted fake DOGE\\u2019s access to student data over privacy concerns.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The cuts cripple education research and student support programs, including for disabled students. Musk\\u2019s unchecked power is dismantling public education infrastructure, another Project 2025 goal. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/musk-doge-education-data.html?searchResultPosition=1\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Orders \\u2018Large Scale\\u2019 Federal Work Force Cuts, Expands Musk\\u2019s Authority</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to plan for mass federal workforce reductions and granted Elon Musk sweeping power over future hiring. The order mandates that most agencies can only hire one employee for every four departures and must consult Musk\\u2019s team before making new career hires.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a drastic restructuring of the federal government, centralizing hiring power under Musk and stripping agencies of control over their own workforce. The move accelerates Trump\\u2019s efforts to gut the civil service, replacing them with loyalists.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/trump-musk-doge-federal-workers.html\\\\\\\">The New York Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Targets FBI Recruits in Purge of Law Enforcement</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump ordered the FBI to provide a list of probationary employees, escalating fears of mass firings. The move follows a broader effort to purge officials involved in Jan. 6 investigations, with Trump appointees already forcing out senior leadership and installing loyalists, including an Elon Musk associate.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a clear attempt to reshape the FBI into a political tool, removing independent law enforcement officials and replacing them with Trump-aligned figures. The chilling effect is already crippling federal law enforcement, creating internal chaos and undermining national security.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna191503\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Musk and Trump Escalate Attacks on Judiciary</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk and Trump lashed out at judges blocking key policies, with Musk calling for impeachment and claiming a \\\\\\\"judicial coup.\\\\\\\" Trump suggested judges were obstructing his agenda, while courts ruled against his spending freeze. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Attacks on the judiciary undermine legal oversight, fueling fears Trump may defy court rulings. With rising threats against judges and Democratic AGs preparing countermeasures, judicial independence is in danger.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/musk-trump-allies-ratchet-up-rhetoric-against-judiciary-2025-02-12/\\\\\\\">Reuters</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Purges Federal Election Security Officials</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump placed 17 CISA election security staffers on leave, stripping state and local election offices of federal cybersecurity support. The sidelined officials had worked to counter cyber threats, foreign interference, and disinformation.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This purge cripples federal election security, making U.S. elections more vulnerable to foreign manipulation. Trump has long attacked CISA for debunking his election fraud claims\\u2014this move cements his control by removing watchdogs and eliminating oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-cyber-agency-puts-election-security-staffers-worked-118671767\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Dept of Education Moves to Erase Transgender Athletes\\u2019 Records</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s Department of Education has ordered the NCAA and high school sports federations to erase records, titles, and awards won by transgender athletes competing in female categories. The move follows Trump\\u2019s executive order banning transgender participation in women\\u2019s sports, prompting the NCAA to revise its policies.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a sweeping rollback of rights for transgender athletes, aligning sports policy with the regime\\u2019s broader crackdown on gender identity recognition. By retroactively stripping achievements, the regime sets a precedent for erasing trans inclusion from public records, fueling legal and civil rights battles. This tactic suggests that Trump will continue to weaponize agencies and erase any data he chooses.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-sports-trump-records-0d44c9c482e392aae6b6486eb429b968\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump FBI Pick Accused of Secretly Ordering Purges</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Sen. Dick Durbin accused Trump\\u2019s FBI nominee, Kash Patel, of secretly orchestrating mass firings at the FBI while publicly denying involvement. Whistleblowers allege Patel issued orders via the White House to remove agents tied to Trump investigations, including Jan. 6 cases.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Patel may have perjured himself under oath, but more critically, his actions mirror authoritarian purges\\u2014gutting independent law enforcement to install loyalists.

The move comes as PBS faces an FCC investigation led by Trump-appointed Chairman Brendan Carr, a key figure in Project 2025, which seeks to cut public broadcasting funding.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> By pressuring PBS, his regime is weaponizing federal oversight to dismantle DEI efforts, suppress independent journalism, and impose ideological control over public media.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293292/pbs-shutters-dei-office-diversity-equity-inclusion-trump-executive-order\\\\\\\">NPR</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump White House to Keep Visitor Logs Secret</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s regime announced it would not release White House visitor logs during his second term, continuing his first-term policy. Unlike Biden, who published records monthly, Trump officials argue they are not required to disclose the logs under the Presidential Records Act.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Hiding visitor records shields influence from lobbyists, foreign entities, and donors. With Trump\\u2019s purge of oversight, this secrecy raises alarms over accountability and government transparency.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-not-release-visitor-logs-during-trumps-second-term\\\\\\\">Fox News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>FEMA Official Defies Court Order, Freezes Grants as Trump Escalates War on Federal Agencies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A senior FEMA official froze grant funding despite a court ruling ordering aid restoration. This follows Trump\\u2019s push to dismantle FEMA, firing four officials for alleged disloyalty. Musk, overseeing budget cuts, echoed Trump\\u2019s attacks, claiming FEMA misused $59 million on migrant housing. Trump now calls for FEMA\\u2019s complete shutdown.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Defying court rulings signals a constitutional crisis as Trump weaponizes agencies. The FEMA purge aligns with Musk\\u2019s push to gut oversight, leaving states vulnerable to disasters without federal aid.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fema-official-ignores-judge-order-freeze-grant-funding-rcna191674\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Orders Military to Erase Webpages on Women\\u2019s Service</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Army and Navy have removed webpages highlighting the contributions of female service members to comply with Trump\\u2019s executive order eliminating DEI programs. The Navy\\u2019s \\u201CWomen of Courage and Intelligence\\u201D page and the Army\\u2019s \\u201CWomen in Army History\\u201D section were taken down, though some pages have been re-uploaded after backlash.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Erasing the history of women in the military is part of a broader effort to rewrite history and further marginalize service members who have historically fought for recognition. This move aligns with the regime\\u2019s larger purge of diversity initiatives across government agencies, reinforcing a rigid ideological agenda at the expense of historical accuracy.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/02/10/army-navy-remove-web-pages-highlighting-womens-military-service/\\\\\\\">Military Times</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>US aid freeze sets back fight against human trafficking in Cambodia</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump\\u2019s foreign aid freeze has forced shelters and rescue organizations fighting human trafficking in Cambodia to scale back or shut down. Victims of forced labor and scam operations, many lured under false pretenses, now have nowhere to turn as funding for rescues and shelters is cut off.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The freeze abandons victims trapped in exploitative forced labor schemes, including those targeting Americans. By crippling anti-trafficking efforts, the regime is enabling criminal networks to expand, undermining U.S. commitments to combat modern slavery while further isolating vulnerable populations.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-scam-compound-shelter-us-funding-freeze-6bc436aeffd46c47b049413e73987d14\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Moves to Weaken Federal Worker Protections</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump submitted draft regulations to strip civil service protections from career federal employees involved in policy, making it easier to fire those seen as obstructing Trump\\u2019s agenda. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This paves the way for a purge of nonpartisan civil servants, replacing them with loyalists. It centralizes presidential power over government agencies, eroding institutional independence and accelerating Trump\\u2019s grip over the federal workforce. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/trump-administration-federal-worker-protections-00203598\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Military Ends Recruiting at Prestigious Black Engineering Event</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Army and other military branches have dropped recruiting efforts at the Black Engineer of the Year Awards, a key event for STEM talent. This follows Trump\\u2019s purge of diversity initiatives in the military.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The decision cuts off the military from a pipeline of highly qualified Black engineers, weakening efforts to attract top technical talent. It underscores the regime\\u2019s extremist agenda and will potentially harm military readiness and innovation.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/10/military-drops-recruiting-efforts-prestigious-black-engineering-awards-event.html\\\\\\\">Military.com</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>GOP Lawmaker Proposes Renaming Greenland \\u2018Red, White, and Blueland\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) introduced the \\\\\\\"Red, White, and Blueland Act of 2025,\\\\\\\" proposing to rename Greenland and authorizing Trump to negotiate its acquisition from Denmark. The bill directs the Interior Secretary to enforce the name change on official maps and documents.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s push to rename and acquire Greenland signals broader imperial ambitions, including past remarks on annexing Canada, stealing Gaza, and reclaiming the Panama Canal. Denmark and Greenland strongly oppose U.S. control, escalating geopolitical tensions and straining diplomatic relations with a NATO ally. </p><p><strong>Source: </strong><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5138543-buddy-carter-donald-trump-greenland-name-change/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump\\u2019s Gaza Plan Mirrors Imperialist Playbook, Echoes Putin\\u2019s Land Grabs</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump doubled down on his plan to \\u201Cown\\u201D and \\u201Ccherish\\u201D Gaza, openly proposing the U.S. take control of the territory, remove Palestinians, and redevelop it into a \\u2018luxury\\u2019 destination.
