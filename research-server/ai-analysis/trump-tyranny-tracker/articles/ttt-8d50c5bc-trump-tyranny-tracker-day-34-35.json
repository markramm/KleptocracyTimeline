  "content": "Elon Musk entering the White House last week. Photo: Nathan Howard/ReutersShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 22-23: Weekend RoundupWelcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Uses Merch to Monetize AgendaWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s team is profiting from MAGA-themed merchandise\u2014including T-shirts with slogans like \"Make Greenland Great Again\" and \"Gulf of America,\" as well as black \u201cdark MAGA\u201d caps worn by Elon Musk\u2014to build a massive war chest. These items, launched rapidly to capitalize on current news cycles, have generated millions in revenue.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s merch scheme is just another revenue generator for his endless campaign, funneling money to his political agenda and cronies. It turns hate speech and extremist ideology into profit, further cementing his grip on power.Source: AxiosElon Musk blurs the line between his government and business rolesWhat Happened: Elon Musk, operating as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d under Trump\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, alternates between his government advisory role and his business duties as CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and others. His appearances at events like CPAC highlight this dual role, where he is praised for gutting agencies while still running his private companies.Why It Matters: This is reminiscent of practices in authoritarian regimes like Russia. Musk\u2019s dual role\u2014using his power to meet with world leaders and advance his business interests\u2014compromises transparency, undermines ethical safeguards, and puts American interests at risk.Source: NPRMusk is laying off workers at the auto safety agency overseeing his car companyWhat Happened: Elon Musk is slashing jobs at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2014the federal agency that oversees auto safety and crash investigations, including those involving Tesla. The cuts come amid Musk\u2019s ongoing criticisms of NHTSA\u2019s investigations and recalls, and were executed through firings, buyouts, and layoffs.Why It Matters: Cutting jobs at NHTSA will cripple its ability to enforce safety standards and investigate crashes, putting public safety directly at risk. It also conveniently blocks any chance to scrutinize Tesla\u2019s safety practices, leaving Americans endangered.Source: Associated PressNew Social Security chief was being investigated when Musk tapped himWhat Happened: Leland Dudek, a Musk data analyst in Social Security\u2019s anti-fraud office suspected of improperly sharing sensitive information with Musk\u2019s unauthorized FAKE DOGE, was under investigation when Trump elevated him to acting Social Security commissioner\u2014forcing longtime acting chief Michelle King to retire abruptly.Why It Matters: This controversial appointment bypasses established protocols and imperils the integrity of Social Security\u2019s sensitive data. By favoring political loyalty over expertise, it risks weaponizing benefit payments for partisan ends while leaving millions of Americans' personal and financial information dangerously exposed.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Expected to Name Kash Patel as Acting ATF DirectorWhat Happened: Sources say Trump will soon designate FBI Director nominee Kash Patel as the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Patel is expected to be sworn in early next week, following the recent firing of ATF general counsel Pamela Hicks by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who claimed Hicks was \u201ctargeting gun owners.\u201dWhy It Matters: This move further consolidates Trump\u2019s control over federal law enforcement, despite Patel\u2019s controversial record and lack of ATF experience. His appointment raises red flags over potential political bias, as Patel has been a vocal critic of the FBI and has aligned himself with far-right extremists.Source: ABC NewsUSAID Layoffs: 2,000 Fired, Majority Placed on LeaveWhat Happened: USAID emailed employees that approximately 2,000 will be laid off and most remaining staff placed on administrative leave, following a federal judge\u2019s dissolution of a restraining order.Why It Matters: These cuts severely cripple USAID's global humanitarian work and endangers U.S. national security while effectively handing another win to adversaries like Russia and China. Trump continues delivering for them.Source: CNN Live UpdatesTrump Appoints Dan Bongino as FBI Deputy DirectorWhat Happened: Trump announced on Truth Social that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host and former law enforcement officer, will serve as the FBI's deputy director.Why It Matters: Bongino\u2019s appointment further politicizes the FBI by placing a partisan extremist, conspiracy theorist media figure in a key leadership role, highlighting impartiality and the integrity of law enforcement. This is shameful.Source: ReutersHegseth Fires Top Military Lawyers to Impose a \u2018Warrior Ethos\u2019What Happened: Defense Secretary Hegseth has dismissed the top judge advocates general from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This move is part of a broader effort to reshape the military by removing legal advisors to replace with loyalists.Why It Matters: Firing seasoned military lawyers erodes essential legal oversight and constitutional safeguards, paving the way for unchecked, unlawful actions both on the battlefield and at home\u2014as Trump has threatened to use the military against his opponents.

His memo, titled \"Operation Whirlwind,\" alleges that these remarks could pose threats to U.S. Supreme Court justices and employees of Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE.Why It Matters: This investigation reflects the weaponization of state power to intimidate critics and silence dissent, a tactic commonly seen in authoritarian regimes like Russia. It underscores how politically motivated crackdowns can suppress free speech under the guise of scrutiny.Source: CBS NewsStates Threaten Fines and Jail Time for Officials Resisting Trump\u2019s Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: In over 20 states, Republican lawmakers have proposed legislation that would impose lawsuits, fines, and even jail time on local officials who refuse to enforce Trump\u2019s anti-sanctuary extremist policies.Why It Matters: This forces local governments to comply with federal immigration demands, undermining state autonomy and democratic checks and balances, while setting a dangerous precedent for coercion and abuse of power.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udea8 Pentagon Plans Mass Firings of Civilian WorkforceWhat Happened: The Pentagon announced plans to cut 5-8% of its civilian workforce\u2014up to 76,000 jobs\u2014with an initial 5,400 probationary employees set to be terminated next week. The decision, part of Trump's federal purge, targets non \u201cmission-critical\u201d roles to align with the regime\u2019s \"America First\" agenda.Why It Matters: This purge will undermine military readiness, as the Pentagon has not conducted the legally required analysis on how terminations could affect national security. The chaotic, rushed process mirrors broader efforts to hollow out federal institutions under an extremist agenda.Source: CNNHow Retired Lt. Gen. Dan Caine Became Trump's Joint Chiefs PickWhat Happened: Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan Caine was unexpectedly chosen by Trump to replace the ousted Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Charles Brown Jr. Notably, Trump claimed that Caine once said he \"loved\" him and would \"kill for you,\" underscoring the general\u2019s fierce loyalty.Why It Matters: Caine's appointment shatters long-standing military leadership traditions and highlights Trump politicizing the armed forces. Replacing experienced commanders with political loyalists will undermine military judgment, weaken checks on executive power, and endanger national security.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsBanning NIH Grant Meetings, Trump Circumvents Courts That Blocked Funding FreezeWhat Happened: Trump has circumvented court rulings blocking its funding freeze by banning public notices for NIH grant review meetings. This move, mandated by HHS, led to the cancellation of 42 of 47 scheduled NIH grant meetings and stalled 16,000 applications\u2014worth approximately $1.5 billion in research funding\u2014threatening vital biomedical research.Why It Matters: This shreds transparency and derails groundbreaking medical research, potentially costing lives by stifling vital discoveries. It\u2019s a stark display of authoritarian power\u2014where the powerful make up their own rules\u2014putting public health and progress at serious risk.Source: Common Dreams\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News'The Bigotry Is Astounding:' Engineers Waste Time Scanning .Gov Sites for 'Transgender' and Other TermsWhat Happened: HHS engineers\u2014and counterparts at agencies like NOAA and EPA\u2014have been ordered to scour websites and PDFs for banned keywords such as \u201cgay,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201cnon-binary,\u201d \u201cDEI,\u201d and others. This directive forces staff to divert from their regular duties to compile lists of offending content for removal.Why It Matters: This purge wastes taxpayer money and cripples efficiency by erasing decades of inclusive content, in order to fuel an extremist agenda.

The plan would classify migrants as disease risks under the Public Health Service Act, bypassing standard asylum procedures.Why It Matters: Reviving Title 42 will strip migrants of their right to seek asylum, further militarizing the border and undermining legal protections. This move is a stark example of how the regime is weaponizing \u201cpublic health\u201d as a pretext to enforce harsh immigration policies, with significant humanitarian and legal implications.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchMusk Email Throws Federal Agencies Into ChaosWhat Happened: Federal employees received an OPM email demanding five bullet points summarizing their weekly accomplishments, with Elon Musk warning on X that failure to reply would be taken as a resignation. Confusion has spread across agencies\u2014from NOAA to NIH\u2014as staff receive conflicting instructions, sparking fears over job losses and security risks.Why It Matters: This insane mandate distracts essential personnel, cripples operational efficiency, and fosters a culture of fear. It showcases how Trump is weaponizing chaos to dismantle accountability and further consolidate power.

posts. The News goes by so fast. I miss a lot of what is happening. I appreciate being able to see what he is doing in such a neat orderly compact way. There is no way I would be able to read all of these articles and figure out what\u2019s going on. I have no clue how you are able to do this, but I definitely am glad that it is being done. I like the short paragraphs that get right to the point no need for all the extra content. If there is a subject, I am particularly interested in. I can research more about it myself which happens to be very rarely if ever.</span></p><p><span>Just wanted to stop and say-</span></p><p><span>Olga, I appreciate you
