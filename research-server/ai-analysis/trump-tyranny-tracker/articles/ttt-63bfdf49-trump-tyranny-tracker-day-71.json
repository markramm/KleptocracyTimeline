  "content": "Elon Musk presents a check for $1 million during a town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Sunday. (Joshua Lott/The Washington Post)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: Mar 31Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump Family to Launch U.S. Bitcoin Mining Venture With Hut 8What Happened: The Trump family is partnering with crypto firm Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin Corp., a new Miami-based venture focused on Bitcoin mining and building strategic Bitcoin reserves. The company will be a majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8.Why It Matters: The move deepens the Trump family's entanglement in the crypto sector\u2014while Trump pushes crypto-friendly policies from the White House. This is pure corruption and raises major conflict-of-interest concerns while politicizing federal crypto regulation.Source: BloombergMusk-funded political group spends big and goes door to door in the Wisconsin Supreme Court raceWhat Happened: Musk\u2019s America PAC has spent over $4.3 million on door-to-door canvassing to boost conservative Brad Schimel in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Musk is urging people to sign up as \u201cblock captains\u201d for $20 per house visited, while also offering $100 per voter signature against \u201cactivist judges.\u201dWhy It Matters: Musk is, yet again, injecting massive cash and manpower into an election that will decide control of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court\u2014and future rulings on abortion, unions, Tesla lawsuit, and election laws. The direct payouts raise ethical questions about vote-buying and election manipulation.Source: Associated PressElon Musk Hands Out $1 Million Checks to Wisconsin Voters Despite Legal ChallengeWhat Happened: Musk handed out two $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters at a rally in Green Bay, moments after the state Supreme Court declined to block the scheme. Musk claimed the recipients were \u201cspokespeople\u201d for his America PAC\u2014a very bad attempt to dodge vote-buying laws. He\u2019s already funneled over $20 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, calling it vital to Trump\u2019s agenda and GOP control of Congress.Why It Matters: This is a brazen case of political bribery and attempting to influence a Tesla lawsuit. Offering cash to voters guts the principle of free and fair elections. Two courts and even a liberal-majority state Supreme Court refused to stop it, setting a dangerous precedent. If this stands, billionaires will escalate buying influence with direct payouts\u2014shredding election integrity in plain sight.Source: Associated PressTesla\u2019s Wisconsin Lawsuit, Elon Musk, and Brad SchimelWhat Happened: Tesla sued the state of Wisconsin in January, challenging the state's \u201cfactory store\u201d law, which bars vehicle manufacturers from directly selling cars. The lawsuit, initially filed in Outagamie County, was recently moved to Milwaukee County.Why It Matters: Musk has poured over $20 million into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, backing conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who would influence Tesla\u2019s legal fight.Source: Milwaukee Journal SentinelHow the Trump Family Took Over a Crypto Firm as It Raised Hundreds of MillionsWhat Happened: The Trump family quietly seized control of crypto firm World Liberty Financial as it raised $550 million through sales of $WLFI tokens. The family now claims 75% of net token revenue and 60% of business profits\u2014despite the project lacking a public platform and offering no profit-sharing or tradeable tokens to investors.Why It Matters: This arrangement creates massive conflicts of interest, with a sitting U.S. president and his family directly profiting from an opaque financial venture they are deregulating. Under crypto's anonymity, this can be used as a vehicle for political access\u2014or foreign influence.Source: ReutersUS Agency Leading Musk\u2019s Firing Spree to Hire New Driver, Emails ShowWhat Happened: Despite a government-wide hiring freeze and mass layoffs, the Office of Personnel Management\u2014run by Musk\u2014approved hiring a new chauffeur for agency leadership. This comes after OPM laid off 200+ staff and offered buyouts to hundreds more as part of Trump and Musk\u2019s federal workforce purge.Why It Matters: While essential workers in social services, veterans care, and regulatory agencies are being cut, resources are still allocated to personal conveniences for top Musk operatives.Source: ReutersZuckerberg Tries to Enlist Trump in Fight Against Meta EU RulingWhat Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is lobbying Trump to intervene against an impending European Union ruling that could fine Meta and force it to offer Facebook and Instagram without personalized ads. The company argues the ruling unfairly targets U.S. firms.Why It Matters: Meta\u2019s ad business depends on personalization, and compliance with the EU order would undercut its profits.

But the US Constitution disagreesWhat Happened: Trump told NBC News he\u2019s serious about seeking a third term, citing his poll numbers as justification. Despite this, the 22nd Amendment clearly limits presidents to two elected terms.Why It Matters: Trump is laying the groundwork for staying in power using tactics similar to those Putin used in Russia.

His visit coincided with a federal judge ordering the agency to reconsider the firings of 51 employees previously assigned to diversity recruiting roles. The court ruled the officers have a right to appeal and be considered for other jobs within the agency.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s deepening role in national intelligence poses a serious national security threat, as his expanding influence threatens the independence and integrity of key government institutions.Source: The New York TimesA DOGE employee is put in charge of the US Institute of Peace, a court filing allegesWhat Happened: A Musk operative has reportedly taken control of the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan, congressionally funded organization, after most of its leadership and staff were abruptly removed. A court filing alleges the new appointee is attempting to transfer the institute\u2019s property to the federal government\u2019s real estate agency.Why It Matters: This is the latest step in Trump and Musk\u2019s campaign to dismantle independent institutions. The takeover of a peace-focused think tank by a political operative highlights the regime\u2019s willingness to bypass norms and weaponize executive power\u2014even in areas of diplomacy and conflict resolution.Source: Associated PressMusk\u2019s DOGE Gains Access to Federal Payroll System Despite Cybersecurity WarningsWhat Happened: Musk operatives were granted administrative access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System\u2014used to process salaries for 276,000 federal employees\u2014despite explicit warnings from senior Interior Department staff. A memo warned this access could expose highly sensitive data and make Musk personnel targets for cyberattacks. Senior officials were placed on administrative leave.Why It Matters: The move bypassed security protocols and violated privacy norms. Musk now has access to sensitive employee data and sweeping power to hire and fire civil servants\u2014accelerating Musk and Trump\u2019s authoritarian purge of the federal workforce.Source: The GuardianIRS Sidelines Dozens of Top IT Officials Seen as \u2018Blockers\u2019 to Immigration Data-SharingWhat Happened: Trump placed around 50 senior IRS IT officials\u2014many with cybersecurity expertise\u2014on administrative leave without explanation. The sidelined staff reportedly resisted efforts by Musk\u2019s operatives to access confidential taxpayer data for immigration enforcement.Why It Matters: The removals gut internal safeguards, paving the way for Trump\u2019s plan to hand taxpayer data to ICE. This violates privacy laws, destroys trust in the IRS, and turns federal agencies into tools for targeting immigrants.Source: CNNTrump Cuts Election Security Funds, Officials Warn of Increased RiskWhat Happened: Trump halted federal election security funding and paused Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency programs, leaving state and local officials scrambling to fill the gap. Programs that once monitored cyber threats and secured voting systems are now in limbo pending a Department of Homeland Security review.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s cuts leave the 2026 elections wide open to hacking and foreign interference. Critical cybersecurity programs have been defunded, threat-sharing has collapsed, and state officials are now flying blind without federal support.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTop Officials Placed on Leave After Refusing DOGE Access to Federal Payroll SystemWhat Happened: Senior Department of the Interior officials were placed on administrative leave after denying Musk operatives full access to a sensitive payroll system used by 275,000 federal employees\u2014including Supreme Court justices. Musk operatives demanded \u201cGod-mode\u201d control over systems that manage pay, credentials, and email access. When officials raised legal and security concerns, they were sidelined and Musk operatives gained access.Why It Matters: Musk continues bypassing security protocols to seize control of critical government infrastructure, including systems beyond Trump\u2019s authority. This opens the door to catastrophic breaches, political retaliation, and the silencing of dissent.Source: WIREDTrump Pardons Navy Veteran Convicted in Capitol RiotWhat Happened: Trump issued a pardon for Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy intelligence officer and Oath Keepers member convicted for obstructing Congress and justice during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Caldwell had previously been sentenced to time served.Why It Matters: This pardon is part of Trump\u2019s sweeping clemency for Capitol rioters and insurrectionists\u2014normalizing political violence and rewarding extremists.

A House bill and hearings this week aim to counter what GOP leaders call judicial overreach. Some Trump allies have even floated defunding courts or impeaching judges, including James Boasberg, who halted mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.Why It Matters: With Congress behind him, the courts are the last line of defense.

The suit, filed under Biden, alleged the law was designed to suppress Black voters.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DOJ is abandoning legal efforts to protect voting rights, giving cover to state-level voter suppression. It\u2019s a clear signal the regime is actively working to suppress equal access to the ballot.Source: Associated PressWhite House Weighs Executive Order to Fast-Track Deep-Sea MiningWhat Happened: Trump is considering an executive order to bypass the UN-backed International Seabed Authority and allow U.S.-backed companies to mine international waters for critical minerals via a streamlined domestic process through NOAA.Why It Matters: This escalates Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d push to bypass global rules and grab critical resources.

Staff were told to surrender government property and lost access to agency systems following a short meeting with Musk operatives.Why It Matters: Without staff, the $266 million in library and museum funding is effectively dead. Critical programs in small, rural, and tribal communities are at risk, gutting access to education, culture, and public services.Source: NPRTrump Transportation Secretary Ties Funding to Birth, Marriage Rates, Favoring Red StatesWhat Happened: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a directive prioritizing federal transportation funding for communities with marriage and birth rates above the national average.Why It Matters: This injects ideology into infrastructure funding, rewarding red states while punishing blue areas like college towns. Birth and marriage rates have nothing to do with transit needs\u2014it's political favoritism disguised as planning.Source: CNNTrump Commutes Sentence of Convicted Fraudster Who Aided GOP Effort to Impeach BidenWhat Happened: Trump commuted the prison sentence and financial penalties of Jason Galanis, who was serving over 14 years for defrauding a Native American tribe.

The move follows similar action against Columbia University, which resulted in the loss of $400 million in federal support after the school agreed to Trump\u2019s demands.Why It Matters: This is a direct assault on academic independence.

The breach, disclosed publicly on March 24, involved high-ranking officials including the Defense Secretary and CIA Director.Why It Matters: Despite bipartisan outrage and ongoing Congressional probes, Trump has declared the Signal scandal \u201ccase closed.\u201d This is an authoritarian tactic\u2014shutting down scrutiny, evading accountability, and normalizing potential national security crimes.Source: ReutersNYU Cancels Doctor\u2019s Talk on USAID Cuts, Citing \u201cAnti-Governmental\u201d ConcernsWhat Happened: NYU abruptly canceled a talk by Dr. Joanne Liu, former head of Doctors Without Borders, over slides referencing Gaza casualties and USAID cuts. Liu said the university told her the content could be perceived as \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201canti-governmental.\u201d NYU compensated her but barred the presentation.Why It Matters: The cancellation reflects a growing trend of self-censorship at U.S. universities amid fear of losing federal funding.

He alluded to legal loopholes that supporters believe could allow him to return via succession.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s remarks are his clearest rejection yet of the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. Legal experts say his theory is baseless\u2014but the intent is clear. Trump has no plans to leave. And history shows: dictators don\u2019t step down voluntarily.Source: The GuardianWhite House May Remake Reporters\u2019 Seating Chart, Escalating TensionsWhat Happened: Trump is considering taking control of the seating chart in the White House press briefing room, a move traditionally overseen by the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. The change would allow the regime to favor right-wing media, podcasters, and influencers over established news outlets.Why It Matters: This move lets Trump\u2019s team punish outlets they don\u2019t like and reward loyalists\u2014an open attack on press freedom.

Nine affiliates have already received notices of defunding.Why It Matters: The freeze will slash access to birth control, cancer screenings, and STI treatment for low-income individuals.

Even vague associations, like tattoos or sports attire, can count as evidence.Why It Matters: This gives ICE broad discretion to deport people without due process, based on flimsy or contradictory evidence. This is a dangerous abuse of power that revives wartime laws to target migrants\u2014denying them basic legal rights.Source: ABC NewsU.S. Tied Migrants to Gang Based Largely on Clothes or Tattoos, Papers ShowWhat Happened: Trump used a wartime law to summarily deport over 100 Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation with Tren de Aragua, based largely on tattoos or clothing like basketball jerseys, according to new court filings. A government \u201cAlien Enemy Validation Guide\u201d awarded points to justify deportations\u2014eight points could be enough, including four for certain tattoos or attire.Why It Matters: The regime\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act\u2014meant for wartime or foreign invasion\u2014is being challenged as unconstitutional. Lawyers argue that migrants have been denied due process and deported based on vague and culturally biased indicators, such as Real Madrid tattoos or Michael Jordan jerseys.Source: The New York TimesMinnesota Student Detained by ICE Was Not an Activist, Lawsuit SaysWhat Happened: A lawsuit filed Sunday reveals that Dogukan Gunaydin, a Turkish graduate student at the University of Minnesota, was arrested by ICE last week not for political activism, but due to a 2023 DUI conviction. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his student visa was revoked, though his legal team says the revocation didn\u2019t appear in systems until hours after the arrest.Why It Matters: The arrest, initially assumed to be tied to pro-Palestinian activism, now appears to reflect a broader Trump tactic: aggressively targeting international students over minor legal infractions.

Musk is urging people to sign up as \\u201Cblock captains\\u201D for $20 per house visited, while also offering $100 per voter signature against \\u201Cactivist judges.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk is, yet again, injecting massive cash and manpower into an election that will decide control of Wisconsin\\u2019s Supreme Court\\u2014and future rulings on abortion, unions, Tesla lawsuit, and election laws.
