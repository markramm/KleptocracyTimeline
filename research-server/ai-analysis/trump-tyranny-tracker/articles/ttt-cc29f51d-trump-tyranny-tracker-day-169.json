(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 7Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Please keep Texas in your thoughts\u2014especially for the families mourning loved ones and those still waiting for news of the missing.What a devastating and heartbreaking tragedy\u2026Some links to help those impacted: New York TimesAuthoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 6Google Meet: July 8, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption News'Indefensible': Trump Budget Law Subsidizes Private Jet Owners While Taking Healthcare From MillionsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s newly signed budget law lets private jet buyers write off the full cost in year one, reinstating \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d for luxury assets. At the same time, the law slashes Medicaid and food aid, stripping healthcare and nutrition support from millions of low-income Americans.Why It Matters: This is a massive tax break for billionaires at the expense of the poor. Trump is subsidizing private jets while slashing healthcare and food aid. Source: Common DreamsTrump Claims \u201860 Minutes\u2019 Settlement Worth $35M Including Ads; Paramount Denies Deal Includes PSAsWhat Happened: Trump is inflating the value of his $16 million lawsuit settlement with Paramount over \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d claiming it includes $15\u2013$20 million in free advertising supporting his causes. Paramount flatly denies any such PSA deal, calling the claim false and asserting the settlement includes no such media provisions.Why It Matters: The settlement serves as leverage over the Paramount-Skydance merger. Sen. Warren is demanding a bribery investigation, warning it could be a backdoor deal for regulatory favors.Source: Variety\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsPlan to slash DHS intel office faces multi-front pushbackWhat Happened: Trump plans to purge 75% of the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, shrinking its staff from 1,000 to 275. The office, key to tracking domestic threats, is being gutted despite objections from lawmakers, police, and Jewish groups.Why It Matters: With antisemitism, extremism, and cyber threats rising, critics say the cuts are reckless. The move cripples threat coordination and weakens homeland security at a dangerous time.Source: Defense One\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsWhat to know about the troops and federal agents in LA\u2019s MacArthur Park Show of Force at LA\u2019s MacArthur Park Sparks OutrageWhat Happened: Nearly 90 National Guard troops and federal immigration agents swarmed MacArthur Park, a landmark in LA\u2019s immigrant community, in an hour-long operation with Humvees, tactical vehicles, and armed soldiers. No arrests were confirmed, and officials gave few details, prompting accusations of political theater and intimidation.Why It Matters: This is outrageous. Trump continues to condition Americans to accept military force on U.S. streets\u2014this time in a public park. The operation marks an unprecedented use of armed troops in a domestic immigration raid, pushing legal boundaries and terrorizing communities. This is a deliberate show of force to suppress dissent and defy state leadership.Source: Associated PressUS troops on the ground in LA immigration enforcement operation, DOD saysWhat Happened: 90 armed troops and federal agents swarmed LA\u2019s MacArthur Park in a dramatic immigration raid, displacing a children\u2019s day camp. Officials say no arrests were made. Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the military-style show of force as political theater meant to instill fear in immigrants.Why It Matters: Using troops to target communities on U.S. soil signals a dangerous normalization of domestic military operations, raising alarms about civil liberties and authoritarian overreach.Source: ABC NewsDocument Casts Doubt on White House\u2019s Claims About Deported VenezuelansWhat Happened: A Salvadoran memo to the UN reveals El Salvador is holding nearly 140 disappeared Venezuelans solely at the request of the U.S., contradicting Trump officials\u2019 claims that El Salvador has full custody. The men were disappeared under the Alien Enemies Act without due process.Why It Matters: The memo exposes a Trump cover-up and shreds Trump officials legal defense. It raises even more grave constitutional and humanitarian concerns over secret, extrajudicial transfers of migrants to foreign prisons.Source: New York TimesI.R.S. Says Churches Can Endorse Candidates From the PulpitWhat Happened: In a court filing, the IRS stated that churches can now endorse political candidates to their congregations without violating the Johnson Amendment, which bans campaigning by tax-exempt nonprofits. The move settles a lawsuit from two Texas churches and religious broadcasters, carving out a narrow exemption for houses of worship.Why It Matters: The decision will unleash a wave of political activity, blurring the line between faith and politics. Legal experts warn this opens the door for candidates to directly court churches as campaign platforms.Source: New York TimesTrump Immigration Enforcer Says ICE Will Boost Raids in New YorkWhat Happened: Tom Homan announced a surge in ICE arrests across New York City, targeting sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal agents. Backed by a $30 billion ICE budget increase, the crackdown will shift toward aggressive community operations, echoing recent militarized raids in Los Angeles.Why It Matters: Trump is intentionally targeting blue states to test federal power\u2014and lay the groundwork for nationwide, military-style immigration enforcement. It threatens immigrant communities, defies due process, and pushes the U.S. closer to a police state.Source: BloombergSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump Admin Asks Staff to Report DEI-Linked Bias ClaimsWhat Happened: Trump is urging federal employees to report discrimination they say resulted from past DEI policies, including cases where staff quit or were disciplined. An HHS email circulated a whistleblower questionnaire as part of Trump\u2019s executive order to dismantle DEI programs.Why It Matters: Trump is now targeting not just policies but the people who upheld them. It paves the way for political retribution and retroactive purges of civil servants.Source: PoliticoStudent loan cancellation program could become Trump retribution tool, some advocates fearWhat Happened: The Education Department is overhauling the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude organizations tied to immigrants, transgender youth, or \u201cillegal activities,\u201d with vague criteria and sweeping powers granted to the education secretary.Why It Matters: The plan would strip loan relief from thousands of public workers, forcing them to leave their jobs or lose forgiveness. Advocates say it weaponizes debt relief to punish political opponents and reshape civil society.Source: Associated PressTrump Wanted \u2018More Action Against Universities.\u2019 His Staff Scrambled to Punish Penn.What Happened: Internal emails reveal Trump ordered aides to yank federal funds from UPenn and San Jose State over trans athlete participation. The cuts were rushed to please Trump and Stephen Miller, even before investigations concluded. Penn later agreed to ban trans athletes and issue apologies to regain $175 million in funding.Why It Matters: This is another example of Trump weaponizing federal funds to punish universities that defy his culture war agenda. He\u2019s using trans rights and antisemitism as test cases to see how far he can expand his power to enforce ideological conformity across all campuses.Source: NOTUS\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump Ends Deportation Protections for Hondurans and NicaraguansWhat Happened: DHS is terminating Temporary Protected Status for 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans, effective September 6. The move follows earlier efforts to revoke protections from Venezuelans, Haitians, Afghans, and others, part of a broader campaign to dismantle legal avenues for migrants.Why It Matters: Thousands of long-settled immigrants now face deportation to countries the U.S. itself warns are unsafe. Advocates say the decision is politically driven and cruel, tearing apart families and destabilizing communities that rely on these workers.Source: ReutersIce \u2018politically targeted\u2019 farm worker activist Juarez Zeferino, colleagues sayWhat Happened: ICE arrested 25-year-old farmworker activist Alfredo \u201cLelo\u201d Juarez Zeferino in March, citing a 2018 deportation order tied to a traffic stop. His supporters say the detention is part of Trump\u2019s broader political crackdown on immigrant and labor leaders. Juarez Zeferino, who helped secure key labor protections in Washington, is now fighting deportation from ICE custody in Tacoma.Why It Matters: Advocates warn that Trump is using ICE to silence dissent and intimidate labor and immigrant rights organizers. Juarez Zeferino\u2019s arrest fits a broader pattern of politically motivated detentions disguised as \u201croutine\u201d immigration enforcement.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 reveals the ongoing cruelty towards migrants in USWhat Happened: Trump and DeSantis opened \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a flood-prone migrant detention camp in the Everglades. Built in just 10 days, it holds detainees in harsh conditions, while supporters profit off merch mocking those imprisoned. The site will hold up to 5,000 people.Why It Matters: This is state-sanctioned cruelty. The camp endangers lives, tramples environmental protections, and serves as a hate-driven political stunt. Republicans are perpetrating blatant human rights violations.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchFloods are swallowing their village. Trump\u2019s EPA cut a major lifeline for them and othersWhat Happened: Trump canceled over $2.7 billion in environmental justice and climate grants, including $20 million for Alaska\u2019s flood-threatened Kipnuk village. Hundreds of projects in underserved areas lost funding, and 200 EPA staff who protested the cuts were put on leave.Why It Matters: The move undermines climate resilience efforts for the nation\u2019s most vulnerable communities, forcing some to collapse. It halts urgently needed adaptation projects in frontline areas, especially Indigenous and low-income communities already hit hardest by climate change. Source: The GuardianTexas lawmakers failed to pass a bill to improve local disaster warning systems this yearWhat Happened: A bill to upgrade Texas' emergency alert systems and communication infrastructure failed in the state Senate earlier this year. The legislation, spurred by past wildfires, would\u2019ve created a $500 million grant program to help rural counties prepare for disasters. Now, after catastrophic floods in Kerr County killed over 100 people, some lawmakers, including GOP Rep. Wes Virdell, who voted against it, say they regret their decision.Why It Matters: The Hill Country floods exposed fatal gaps in Texas\u2019s disaster preparedness. Critics say lawmakers\u2019 failure to fund emergency systems left rural communities defenseless. The tragedy underscores the deadly cost of political inaction.Source: The Texas TribuneFDA Layoffs Could Compromise Safety of Medications Made at Foreign Factories, Inspectors SayWhat Happened: The FDA purged over 3,500 employees, including key support staff for foreign drug inspections. Though inspectors remain, they say the loss of experienced personnel and logistical support is slowing operations and compromising the oversight of overseas factories that produce most of America\u2019s generic drugs.Why It Matters: Inspectors say vital safety checks are being delayed or missed, putting millions at risk. With fewer watchdogs on the ground and chaos behind the scenes, dangerous medications could slip through the cracks\u2014turning drug safety into a deadly gamble.Source: ProPublicaUS posts highest annual measles case tally in 33 years amid Texas outbreakWhat Happened: The U.S. has reported 1,277 measles cases so far in 2025\u2014the most since 1992\u2014driven largely by a major outbreak in Texas. RFK Jr., a longtime anti-vaxxer, has fired CDC vaccine experts and brought in anti-vaccine allies to rewrite immunization policy.Why It Matters: Measles was once eliminated in the U.S.\u2014its return shows what happens when an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist runs public health. Experts say this entirely preventable epidemic stems from political interference and disinformation, and more children will suffer as a result.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchExclusive: Proposal outlines large-scale 'Humanitarian Transit Areas' for Palestinians in GazaWhat Happened: A proposal linked to the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation outlines a $2 billion plan to build \u201cHumanitarian Transit Areas\u201d in and around Gaza to house, \u201cderadicalize,\u201d and possibly relocate Palestinians. Although the group denies submitting the plan, sources indicate that it was circulated within the Trump regime and discussed at the White House.Why It Matters: Human rights groups warn such camps could amount to coerced relocation under military occupation\u2014fueling fears of ethnic cleansing and undermining international humanitarian norms.Source: ReutersRussia striking NATO while China invades Taiwan 'plausible' scenario, experts sayWhat Happened: NATO officials are warning that a two-front war\u2014with China invading Taiwan and Russia striking NATO\u2014is now \u201cplausible.\u201d A statement from Secretary General Mark Rutte reveals concern that Beijing may coordinate with Moscow to divide and distract Western forces.Why It Matters: This raises the risk of a global war at a time when the U.S. is increasingly seen as unreliable. Trump has repeatedly questioned America\u2019s NATO commitments and plans to pull U.S. troops from Europe, alarming allies and weakening deterrence. As the Russia-China-North Korea axis gains strength, the West appears fractured and underprepared.Source: Kyiv Independent\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchGerman Far Right Adopts Trump-Inspired Strategy to Seize PowerWhat Happened: Germany\u2019s far-right AfD is trying to break the country\u2019s firewall against extremism by adopting a U.S.-style polarization strategy. An internal strategy paper calls for creating a \u201cduel\u201d between the far left and the AfD to normalize itself as a mainstream conservative force\u2014echoing Trump\u2019s playbook.Why It Matters: The AfD is deliberately eroding a cornerstone of postwar German democracy. With rising power in parliament, backing from MAGA allies like Steve Bannon and Russia, it\u2019s testing whether Germany\u2019s defenses against extremism can withstand a new wave of anti-democratic populist disruption.Source: PoliticoMAGA media eat their own after Trump administration denies their Epstein conspiracy theoriesWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s DOJ and FBI, led by loyalists Dan Bongino and Kash Patel, released findings debunking MAGA-fueled Epstein conspiracies\u2014saying there\u2019s no client list, blackmail ring, or evidence of murder. MAGA influencers are now turning on AG Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and even Trump himself.Why It Matters: After years of feeding conspiracy theories, Trump\u2019s team is now facing blowback from its own base. The MAGA media machine is imploding under the weight of its false promises and failed narratives.Source: Media Matters\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsJapan, South Korea face 25% tariffs as Trump ramps up trade war in letters to leadersWhat Happened: Trump notified Japan, South Korea, and 12 other countries that steep new U.S. tariffs, 25% or higher, will take effect August 1. The move follows months of stalled trade talks, with Trump threatening even higher tariffs on BRICS nations adopting \u201canti-American\u201d policies.Why It Matters: Markets plunged as businesses brace for more price spikes, supply chain chaos, and retaliatory tariffs, raising fears of wider economic fallout.Source: ReutersThe declining dollar faces more headwinds after posting worst first-half return in 52 yearsWhat Happened: The U.S. dollar fell 10.7% in the first half of 2025\u2014its steepest decline in 52 years\u2014amid Trump trade volatility, fiscal deficits nearing $2 trillion, and expectations of Fed rate cuts. Global investors are fleeing to gold, and some firms are betting further decline is likely.Why It Matters: The slump threatens U.S. global financial dominance and may fuel inflation, weaken the Fed\u2019s influence, and destabilize markets. Trump allies\u2019 calls for a weaker dollar are amplifying investor anxiety.Source: CNBCDeals made by Trump since pausing his \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 tariffs remain sparseWhat Happened: Three months after Trump paused sweeping tariffs to pursue 90 trade deals in 90 days, only the U.K. and Vietnam have signed agreements. The deadline has now been extended, with new tariff threats issued to 14 countries.Why It Matters: Businesses face mounting uncertainty as Trump\u2019s erratic trade agenda lurches from threat to delay with no strategic payoff.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Doctors and public health organizations sue Kennedy over vaccine policy changeWhat Happened: Major medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are suing the U.S. government after RFK Jr. removed COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The lawsuit accuses Kennedy of bypassing scientific review and misleading the public.Source: Associated PressJudge blocks Trump from cutting off Planned Parenthood funding What Happened: A federal judge temporarily halted part of Trump\u2019s spending law that aimed to cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The 14-day order ensures continued funding while litigation proceeds after the organization sued to block the targeted provision.Source: CBS NewsTrump Fired Them.

Trump continues to condition Americans to accept military force on U.S. streets\\u2014this time in a public park.

Officials say no arrests were made. Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom condemned the military-style show of force as political theater meant to instill fear in immigrants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Using troops to target communities on U.S. soil signals a dangerous normalization of domestic military operations, raising alarms about civil liberties and authoritarian overreach.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-troops-ground-la-immigration-enforcement-operation-dod/story?id=123542308\\\\\\\">ABC News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Document Casts Doubt on White House\\u2019s Claims About Deported Venezuelans</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A Salvadoran memo to the UN reveals El Salvador is holding nearly 140 disappeared Venezuelans solely at the request of the U.S., contradicting Trump officials\\u2019 claims that El Salvador has full custody.
