Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images/FileShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 12-13Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsCrypto Money Talks: Congress Delivers Wins After $130M Spending BlitzWhat Happened: The crypto industry spent over $130 million in the 2024 elections backing pro-crypto candidates. Those lawmakers are now pushing favorable bills like the GENIUS Act, repealing IRS rules, and advancing stablecoin legislation\u2014while SEC enforcement fades under Trump.Why It Matters: Crypto firms are cashing in on their political investments, shaping federal law to their advantage, and benefiting Trump\u2019s personal business interests, with no regard to consumer protections.Source: New York TimesThe Trump Family Is Going All-In on Crypto Projects, From Bitcoin Mining to StablecoinsWhat Happened: Trump and his family are aggressively expanding their footprint in the crypto world, launching ventures across NFTs, Bitcoin mining, stablecoins, meme-coins, and decentralized finance. These moves coincide with Trump\u2019s broader deregulatory push and legislative efforts that benefit the industry.Why It Matters: The Trump family\u2019s direct involvement in crypto\u2014while Trump pushes pro-crypto policies and guts enforcement\u2014is blatant corruption. Trump, his allies, and his family are profiting from projects he is regulating, turning U.S. financial policy into a tool for self-enrichment.Source: Bloomberg\u2018Completely Out of Touch\u2019: Trump Golfs and Fundraises as Economy CratersWhat Happened: As financial markets nosedive and fears of a recession mount, Trump has spent the past week golfing with Saudis, dining with donors, and dismissing economic pain. He skipped a military repatriation ceremony, charged $1 million a plate for a MAGA fundraiser, and played in his own golf tournament\u2014all while insisting on Truth Social that his tariff war is \u201cdoing really well.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is governing like a mad king\u2014isolated, erratic, and indifferent to the chaos he\u2019s causing. As he ignores expert warnings and mocks allies, his reckless policies are shredding U.S. credibility and economy, destabilizing markets, and deepening public anxiety.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Tells Judge It Doesn\u2019t Have to Bring Back Man It Illegally Disappeared to El SalvadorWhat Happened: Despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering Trump to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2014illegally disappeared to El Salvador\u2014the DOJ now claims it has no legal obligation to bring him back. Trump officials argue the U.S. has no jurisdiction and refuse to release details of the migrant detention deal with El Salvador, where Abrego is being held in a notorious gulag.Why It Matters: Trump is openly defying the Supreme Court and using foreign detention centers to bypass U.S. law. It\u2019s a dangerous escalation\u2014undermining due process, enabling extrajudicial deportations, and weaponizing international deals to hold migrants indefinitely outside legal oversight.Source: Rolling StoneTrump Order Seeks Costly Voting Machine Overhaul, Raising Chaos ConcernsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order that would force states to buy new voting machines that don\u2019t yet exist or revert to hand-counting ballots. The order also demands voter citizenship checks, changes mail-in ballot deadlines, and gives the federal government expanded oversight of state voter rolls.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s voting machine mandate is an unworkable, billion-dollar mess. It\u2019s technically impossible, legally dubious, and guaranteed to wreak havoc on the 2026 midterms\u2014which is the point. States don\u2019t have the funding, systems, or authority to comply\u2014and courts are already swamped with lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.Source: The Washington PostTrump\u2019s Retribution Sends a Chilling Message: Dissent Equals PunishmentWhat Happened: Trump has launched a sweeping campaign of retribution\u2014targeting former officials, universities, student protesters, judges, and law firms. He ordered investigations into ex-officials like Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, demanded free legal work from firms that opposed him, revoked student visas, closed federal offices in blue cities, froze grants to elite universities, and called for judges to be impeached. A DOJ lawyer was even suspended for admitting a wrongful deportation in court.Why It Matters: This is not policy\u2014it\u2019s political retribution and an authoritarian takeover. Trump is using the full weight of the federal government to punish dissent, intimidate critics, and silence opposition\u2014and he is just getting started. The message is clear: loyalty is demanded, and defiance comes at a cost.Source: CNNTrump overrode Social Security staff to list immigrants as deadWhat Happened: Trump, Musk, and DHS forced the Social Security Administration to falsely mark over 6,100 living immigrants as dead, cutting off their ability to work or receive benefits. A senior SSA official who objected was removed from his post.Why It Matters: Legal experts say the move is illegal and amounts to falsifying federal records. It\u2019s part of a broader extremist effort to use federal systems to target immigrants, stripping them of rights and due process.Source: The Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsDozens of DHS staffers, including top FEMA officials, given lie detector tests over alleged leaksWhat Happened: Roughly 50 DHS employees, including FEMA\u2019s acting chief, were subjected to polygraph tests in a leak investigation tied to reports on plans to gut the agency. At least one FEMA official was removed after failing a test. Why It Matters: This is authoritarian intimidation, plain and simple. Trump\u2019s DHS is using lie detectors to root out dissent, not espionage. As the regime moves to dismantle FEMA, purge its staff, and hand over disaster response to Musk\u2019s private networks, morale has collapsed. This crackdown is a political purge masked as a national security probe.Source: CNNTrump Authorizes Military to Seize Control of Federal Land at Southern BorderWhat Happened: Trump authorized the military to take control of federal land along the southern border, including the Roosevelt Reservation, for surveillance and wall construction. The Pentagon can now designate these areas as military zones\u2014allowing troops to detain migrants as \"trespassers,\" a likely end-run around the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement.Why It Matters: This unprecedented militarization of federal land erodes civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent by blurring the line between national defense and domestic law enforcement. Trump is turning immigration policy into a battlefield\u2014bypassing constitutional limits on military power inside U.S. borders.Source: CNNSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFlorida universities to deputize campus police for immigration enforcementWhat Happened: At least 3 Florida public universities\u2014UF, FAU, and USF\u2014are pursuing agreements to deputize campus police for immigration enforcement. This reverses previous protections that treated campuses as \u201csensitive locations\u201d under federal policy, which Trump has since scrapped.Why It Matters: Trump is turning universities into front lines of his immigration crackdown\u2014revoking visas, targeting student protesters, and blurring the line between education and enforcement. It\u2019s a sweeping assault on civil rights, academic freedom, and the safety of international students.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsHomeland Security Email Tells U.S. Citizen to \u2018Immediately\u2019 Self-DeportWhat Happened: DHS sent out mass emails revoking \"parole\" status for individuals without lawful immigration status\u2014urging them to leave the U.S. within seven days. But at least one recipient was a U.S.-born immigration attorney, raising alarm over the process\u2019s accuracy and legality.Why It Matters: DHS\u2019s flawed, automated enforcement system is putting innocent people\u2014including U.S. citizens\u2014at risk of deportation. It\u2019s a reckless process with no safeguards, no accountability, and mounting legal chaos.Source: WIREDNo Evidence Linking Tufts Student to Antisemitism or Terrorism, State Dept. FoundWhat Happened: Just days before ICE detained Tufts PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, a State Department memo found no evidence linking her to antisemitism or support for Hamas. The sole justification cited was her co-authorship of a student op-ed criticizing Tufts\u2019 financial ties to Israel. Despite the absence of any proof, the Trump regime invoked a discretionary visa authority that requires no evidence to revoke her visa and justify her detention.Why It Matters: Ozturk\u2019s detention is now a flashpoint in Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on international students and campus protestors. Even pro-Israel groups at Tufts condemned the move. Her case highlights growing alarm over free speech violations, lack of due process, and the abuse of immigration powers to punish dissent. Source: The Washington PostEmboldened Anti-Abortion Extremists Push to Criminalize Women for AbortionsWhat Happened: A radical faction of \u201cabortion abolitionists\u201d is pushing for women who have abortions to be charged with homicide. Once considered fringe, the movement has gained momentum since the fall of Roe and the GOP\u2019s consolidation of federal power. Why It Matters: The GOP\u2019s court-driven rollback of abortion rights has emboldened extremists who want to imprison women for ending pregnancies. It\u2019s no longer just about bans\u2014it\u2019s about criminalization. This escalation is part of a wider assault on women\u2019s autonomy, freedom, and equality under the law.Source: Associated PressRepublicans plow ahead with anti-abortion agenda in states where voters approved constitutional amendmentsWhat Happened: Despite voters in 7 states approving constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights in 2024, Republican lawmakers in more than half of those states are pushing new restrictions. Measures include curbs on abortion medication, punishing doctors for discussing abortion, and efforts to block future ballot initiatives.Why It Matters: The GOP is openly defying the will of voters to enforce minority rule on abortion. Even where people overwhelmingly supported reproductive freedom, Republican lawmakers are using legislative backdoors to roll back those rights and silence direct democracy.Source: NBC NewsMilitary academies criticized for removing DEI-related books from librariesWhat Happened: The U.S. Naval Academy removed 381 on race, gender, and identity from its library following Trump\u2019s executive order banning \u201cradical indoctrination\u201d and \u201cDEI\u201d content. Titles by Maya Angelou, Ibram X. Kendi, and others were pulled and hidden from access. Similar removals are happening across military institutions.Why It Matters: This is government censorship, plain and simple. Trump\u2019s war on \u201cDEI\u201d has turned military academies into political battlegrounds\u2014threatening academic freedom, erasing history, and signaling to future military leaders that open thought and inclusion are now liabilities.Source: ABC NewsVisas revoked for students at universities in Southern states amid crackdownWhat Happened: Universities across the South\u2014including Texas A&M, FIU, UNC, and Rice\u2014have reported dozens of international students having their visas revoked or immigration status terminated without explanation. Not all affected students were politically active.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown weaponizes immigration to silence dissent, targeting foreign students who criticize U.S. policies or allies. It\u2019s a chilling attack on protest and academic freedom\u2014and a classic authoritarian tactic. If left unchecked, it will expand to all students.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchRFK Jr. Cut 10,000 HHS Jobs. Milwaukee Kids Paid the Price.What Happened: Under orders to slash 10,000 jobs at HHS, RFK Jr. dismantled the CDC\u2019s lead poisoning program\u2014just as Milwaukee requested federal help investigating a lead crisis in public schools. The agency declined, citing a lack of capacity.Why It Matters: The job cuts are endangering public health, especially in low-income, majority-Black communities. With Trump and Musk dismantling agencies and purging workers, local governments are left to manage life-threatening crises on their own.Source: Mother JonesNavy Fires Leaders of Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron 4What Happened: Cmdr. Brett Robblee and Command Master Chief Felix Phillips were relieved of duty on April 11 due to a \u201closs of confidence\u201d in their leadership, according to the Navy. No further details were provided. Both have been temporarily reassigned.Why It Matters: The sudden leadership overhaul in a critical naval unit hints at possible dysfunction within U.S. maritime security operations. Without transparency, it raises red flags about readiness, internal conflict, or emerging threats in a vital defense area.Source: Military TimesDOJ Ends Environmental Justice Agreement in Alabama, Citing Trump\u2019s DEI BanWhat Happened: The Department of Justice has terminated its environmental justice agreement in Lowndes County, Alabama\u2014a predominantly Black rural area plagued by severe wastewater issues. The move follows Trump\u2019s executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing \u201cDEI\u201d initiatives.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s dismantling of DEI priorities is directly gutting federal efforts to protect marginalized communities. In this case, it leaves Black residents in Lowndes County exposed to unsafe, unsanitary conditions with no federal support.Source: Associated Press\u2018Bureaucratic Cruelty\u2019: Trump Cuts Jeopardize 9/11 Health Program for Survivors and RespondersWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s mass layoffs and destruction of HHS\u2014driven by Musk and RFK Jr.\u2014have plunged the World Trade Center Health Program into disarray. Cancer treatments, PTSD care, and other vital services for 9/11 survivors and first responders have been cut with no transparency on what, if anything, is still covered.Why It Matters: This is reprehensible and a betrayal to those who sacrificed the most on 9/11. First responders and survivors are now left in limbo\u2014unsure if their cancer treatments, PTSD care, or routine checkups will be covered. Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchCanadians Halt U.S. Travel Over Trump\u2019s Tariffs, Annexation Talk, and Border DetentionsWhat Happened: Canadian tourism to the U.S. is collapsing amid Trump\u2019s hostile rhetoric, including threats to annex Canada, aggressive tariffs, and reports of border detentions. Tour operators are canceling trips, bookings are down up to 90%, and businesses along the U.S.-Canada border are taking major financial hits.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s belligerent foreign policy and mass deportation agenda are unraveling one of America\u2019s closest alliances. The backlash\u2014already visible in plummeting tourism from the UK\u2014will cost the U.S. billions in revenue and inflict lasting damage on America\u2019s global image.Source: PoliticoUK Tourism to U.S. Drops Sharply Amid Trump\u2019s Rhetoric and Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: UK travel to the U.S. dropped 14.3% in March 2025 compared to last year, with similar declines across Western Europe. The drop comes amid reports of tourist detentions and aggressive immigration enforcement, including a widely publicized case involving a British backpacker. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s hostile rhetoric, immigration crackdowns, and escalating trade wars are driving international tourists away\u2014hitting the U.S. economy hard. With the UK retreating from a top tourism spot, experts warn this could signal a broader collapse in global goodwill and travel confidence.Source: The GuardianTrump\u2019s Push to Take Over Greenland Sparks Defiance in the ArcticWhat Happened: Trump has revived his threats to illegally annex Greenland, suggesting military force if necessary and dismissing Denmark\u2019s ability to secure the Arctic. His regime claims U.S. control is \u201cvital\u201d for missile defense and countering Russian and Chinese influence. Greenland\u2019s Inuit population has responded defiantly: \u201cWe are not for sale.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is trying to mirror Putin. Trump\u2019s threats of an imperial-style land grab threaten to destabilize U.S.-European relations and trample Indigenous sovereignty. Greenland is already home to a key U.S. base\u2014Trump\u2019s push to own the island is about dominance, not defense.Source: CBS News / 60 MinutesPanama Opposition Accuses U.S. of \u201cCamouflaged Invasion\u201d Over Canal Military DealWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of U.S. troops to Panama and the revival of operations at 3 former U.S. military bases, sparking outrage. Opposition leaders in Panama call it a \u201ccamouflaged invasion\u201d that violates the 1977 canal neutrality treaty. The government insists the agreement is temporary and not a violation of sovereignty, but leaked documents suggest otherwise.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aggressive push to \u201cretake\u201d the Panama Canal and deploy troops\u2014framed as countering China\u2014has triggered backlash and reignited painful memories of the 1989 U.S. invasion. The move threatens Panama\u2019s sovereignty, risks regional unrest, and deepens diplomatic instability across Latin America.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchHow the GOP Fell for Putin\u2019s RussiaWhat Happened: In an ideological shift, Trump and much of the Republican Party have embraced Putin's rhetoric and policies, overturning decades of U.S. opposition to Russian authoritarianism. From aligning with Russian propaganda on Ukraine to appointing Kremlin-friendly officials, Trump\u2019s second term has transformed Moscow from America's adversary into a cultural and geopolitical ally.Why It Matters: This marks the collapse of America\u2019s global leadership and the GOP\u2019s full embrace of Russian-style authoritarianism. Trump and the GOP aren\u2019t just cozying up to Putin\u2014they are aligning the U.S. with a genocidal war criminal who\u2019s actively mass-murdering civilians in Ukraine. Source: New York TimesMeet Alexander Dugin, the Russian Extremist Courting MAGA MediaWhat Happened: Alexander Dugin\u2014often called \u201cPutin\u2019s brain\u201d\u2014is pushing his ultranationalist, anti-democracy ideology in pro-Trump circles. Over the past year, he\u2019s appeared on shows hosted by Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Glenn Greenwald, and others, aligning himself with MAGA rhetoric against \u201cwokeism,\u201d LGBTQ rights, and \u201cglobalism.\u201dWhy It Matters: Dugin has called for the destruction of Ukraine and the elimination of all Ukrainians, is a fascist, and promotes a Eurasian empire built on authoritarianism. His rise in MAGA media\u2014paired with Trump\u2019s alliance with Putin\u2014reiterates a dangerous ideological fusion between U.S. far-right circles and Kremlin-backed extremism.Source: Wall Street JournalRussian Missile Strike Kills at Least 34 in Ukraine as Trump Pushes Cease-fireWhat Happened: Russia launched a brutal ballistic missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing at least 34 civilians and injuring 117. The missiles hit a university and a crowded street during Palm Sunday, targeting Ukrainians heading to church in the deadliest attack this year.Why It Matters: The strike came just two days after Trump\u2019s envoy met with\u2014and whitewashed\u2014Putin for the third time, ignoring Russia\u2019s ongoing genocide. It\u2019s clear neither Russia nor Trump intends to stop the war unless Ukraine surrenders. Sparing Russia from Trump\u2019s new tariffs only reinforces the message: this isn\u2019t pressure\u2014it\u2019s complicity.Source: Wall Street JournalSuspect Arrested for Arson Attack on Gov. Shapiro\u2019s Home While Family Slept InsideWhat Happened: Cody Balmer, 38, was arrested for allegedly throwing a Molotov cocktail at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s residence while Shapiro and his family were inside. The early-morning fire caused significant damage. Balmer, who has posted anti-Democrat content online, faces charges including attempted murder, terrorism, and aggravated arson.Why It Matters: This was a targeted political attack, possibly tied to Shapiro\u2019s Jewish faith. It marks another escalation in violent extremism and political hatred fueled by online radicalization and partisan rage. Meanwhile, the FBI has redirected the domestic terrorism task force to focus on immigration.Source: ABC NewsWisconsin Teen Allegedly Kills Parents in Plot to Assassinate Trump, FBI SaysWhat Happened: Seventeen-year-old Nikita Casap is accused of murdering his parents in Wisconsin as part of a plan to gain financial independence and carry out a plot to assassinate Trump. Federal investigators uncovered extremist writings praising Hitler, detailed plans for political violence, and connections to the neo-Nazi group \u201cThe Order of Nine Angles.\u201d The teen was arrested in Kansas with cash, jewelry, and a gun, and is facing both state and federal charges.Why It Matters: This highlights the rising danger of white supremacist domestic terrorism driven by neo-Nazi ideology. It marks another escalation in violent extremism and political hatred fueled by online radicalization and partisan rage. Meanwhile, the FBI has redirected the domestic terrorism task force to focus on immigration.Source: CNN\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsInvestor who predicted the 2008 financial crisis says he's 'worried about something worse than a recession'What Happened: Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio said the U.S. is on the brink of a recession\u2014and could face a far deeper crisis if Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy economic policies and debt mismanagement continue. He cited historical parallels to the 1930s, pointing to global instability, mounting debt, and a collapsing monetary order.Why It Matters: Dalio, who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, is now sounding alarms about systemic economic collapse, not just a downturn. Trump\u2019s erratic economic policies, rising protectionism, and failure to manage debt could trigger a global financial unraveling.Source: NBC NewsTrump Sows Tariff Confusion, Walks Back Electronics ExemptionsWhat Happened: Trump and top aides contradicted newly announced reciprocal tariff exemptions on electronics, signaling that exemptions for products like smartphones and semiconductors may soon be reversed. Trump now claims there was no real exemption\u2014only a shift to a different \u201ctariff bucket\u201d\u2014as Commerce Secretary Lutnick confirms new semiconductor tariffs are coming.Why It Matters: The mixed messaging fuels economic uncertainty, especially for tech companies and consumers. Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policy threatens supply chains, raises prices, and deepens distrust in U.S. trade policy.Source: CNBCChina Halts Critical Exports as Trade War with Trump EscalatesWhat Happened: Beijing has suspended exports of vital rare earth minerals and magnets used in electric vehicles, missiles, semiconductors, and jet engines. The freeze includes six heavy rare earth elements and rare earth magnets, now restricted under new export licensing rules still being developed.Why It Matters: China controls nearly all global supply of key rare earth materials\u2014and its export halt could cripple U.S. car manufacturing, semiconductor production, and military supply chains within weeks. Source: New York TimesEconomic Outlook Tanks Just 3 Months Into Trump\u2019s Term, Recession Fears SpikeWhat Happened: A Wall Street Journal survey shows economists have slashed U.S. growth forecasts and doubled the odds of a recession\u2014from 22% in January to 45% now\u2014due to Trump\u2019s aggressive and incompetent tariff rollout. GDP growth for 2025 is projected at just 0.8%, the weakest since the pandemic, as businesses reel from supply chain shocks and inflation expectations surge.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s erratic trade war is destabilizing the global economy and undermining business confidence at home. Inflation is rising, unemployment is expected to climb, and Wall Street fears Trump\u2019s policies could trigger a full-blown recession.Source: Wall Street JournalManufacturers struggle with uncertainty, chaos in Trump tariffsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s aggressive and erratic tariff policies\u2014especially the 145% levy on Chinese imports and the suspended 10% blanket tax\u2014have thrown U.S. manufacturing into turmoil. Companies report rising costs, canceled orders, and stalled international demand amid the uncertainty.Why It Matters: The very sector Trump claims to be rescuing\u2014American manufacturing\u2014is now teetering under the weight of chaotic trade policy. The unpredictability is freezing global business relationships, souring the economic outlook, and pushing the U.S. closer to recession.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News4/19- Next National Day of ActionSource: 50501Harvard Professors Sue Trump Over $9B Funding ThreatWhat Happened: Harvard faculty groups have filed a lawsuit against Trump after he threatened to cut $9 billion in federal funding, accusing the university of failing to curb antisemitism.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Authoritarian Loyalty Tests \u2014 Trump\u2019s DHS is using polygraphs to intimidate public servants and root out perceived \u201cdisloyalty\u201d\u2014not actual espionage. It\u2019s a political purge disguised as a security measure, gutting morale and consolidating power through fear.Corruption in Plain Sight \u2014 Trump and his family are profiting directly from crypto ventures while shaping financial policy to benefit themselves. Deregulation is about personal enrichment.Authoritarian Power Grab \u2014 From purging officials to militarizing the border, Trump is using the machinery of government to punish critics, sidestep laws, and cement one-man rule.Crackdown on Dissent \u2014 International students, universities, and protestors are under siege. Trump\u2019s immigration and education policies are being weaponized to suppress free speech and academic freedom.U.S. Alignment with Authoritarianism \u2014 Trump and the GOP\u2019s embrace of Putin, Dugin, and Kremlin propaganda reflects an ideological alignment.

start to finish and I am both absolutely horrified and staggered to realise how many thousands of Americans are following through with enforcing these dictatorial attempts at suppressing dissent throughout the USA in clear breach of the constitution. In the UK it could not happen and our law enforcement staff are non-political. I do not believe that so many in the USA have been corrupted by these attempts at extreme suppression driven by the desire to enrich themselves. The GOP must be feeding off misguided beliefs of unfair treatment which goes back decades. The pure ignorance of the whole set of policies is something unseen since the French Revolution or Russian Revolutions or Nazi takeover of parts of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is like an unstoppable wish to self-destruct.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div

He skipped a military repatriation ceremony, charged $1 million a plate for a MAGA fundraiser, and played in his own golf tournament\\u2014all while insisting on Truth Social that his tariff war is \\u201Cdoing really well.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is governing like a mad king\\u2014isolated, erratic, and indifferent to the chaos he\\u2019s causing.

Trump officials argue the U.S. has no jurisdiction and refuse to release details of the migrant detention deal with El Salvador, where Abrego is being held in a notorious gulag.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is openly defying the Supreme Court and using foreign detention centers to bypass U.S. law.

The order also demands voter citizenship checks, changes mail-in ballot deadlines, and gives the federal government expanded oversight of state voter rolls.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s voting machine mandate is an unworkable, billion-dollar mess. It\\u2019s technically impossible, legally dubious, and guaranteed to wreak havoc on the 2026 midterms\\u2014which is the point.

He ordered investigations into ex-officials like Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, demanded free legal work from firms that opposed him, revoked student visas, closed federal offices in blue cities, froze grants to elite universities, and called for judges to be impeached. A DOJ lawyer was even suspended for admitting a wrongful deportation in court.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is not policy\\u2014it\\u2019s political retribution and an authoritarian takeover. Trump is using the full weight of the federal government to punish dissent, intimidate critics, and silence opposition\\u2014and he is just getting started.

A senior SSA official who objected was removed from his post.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Legal experts say the move is illegal and amounts to falsifying federal records. It\\u2019s part of a broader extremist effort to use federal systems to target immigrants, stripping them of rights and due process.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/12/trump-immigrants-dead-social-security/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Dozens of DHS staffers, including top FEMA officials, given lie detector tests over alleged leaks</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Roughly 50 DHS employees, including FEMA\\u2019s acting chief, were subjected to polygraph tests in a leak investigation tied to reports on plans to gut the agency. At least one FEMA official was removed after failing a test. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is authoritarian intimidation, plain and simple. Trump\\u2019s DHS is using lie detectors to root out dissent, not espionage. As the regime moves to dismantle FEMA, purge its staff, and hand over disaster response to Musk\\u2019s private networks, morale has collapsed.

The Pentagon can now designate these areas as military zones\\u2014allowing troops to detain migrants as \\\\\\\"trespassers,\\\\\\\" a likely end-run around the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This unprecedented militarization of federal land erodes civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent by blurring the line between national defense and domestic law enforcement.

But at least one recipient was a U.S.-born immigration attorney, raising alarm over the process\\u2019s accuracy and legality.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> DHS\\u2019s flawed, automated enforcement system is putting innocent people\\u2014including U.S. citizens\\u2014at risk of deportation.

Found</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Just days before ICE detained Tufts PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, a State Department memo found no evidence linking her to antisemitism or support for Hamas. The sole justification cited was her co-authorship of a student op-ed criticizing Tufts\\u2019 financial ties to Israel. Despite the absence of any proof, the Trump regime invoked a discretionary visa authority that requires no evidence to revoke her visa and justify her detention.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Ozturk\\u2019s detention is now a flashpoint in Trump\\u2019s escalating crackdown on international students and campus protestors. Even pro-Israel groups at Tufts condemned the move. Her case highlights growing alarm over free speech violations, lack of due process, and the abuse of immigration powers to punish dissent. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/13/tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-rubio-trump/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Emboldened Anti-Abortion Extremists Push to Criminalize Women for Abortions</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A radical faction of \\u201Cabortion abolitionists\\u201D is pushing for women who have abortions to be charged with homicide. Once considered fringe, the movement has gained momentum since the fall of Roe and the GOP\\u2019s consolidation of federal power. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The GOP\\u2019s court-driven rollback of abortion rights has emboldened extremists who want to imprison women for ending pregnancies.

Measures include curbs on abortion medication, punishing doctors for discussing abortion, and efforts to block future ballot initiatives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The GOP is openly defying the will of voters to enforce minority rule on abortion.

Titles by Maya Angelou, Ibram X. Kendi, and others were pulled and hidden from access. Similar removals are happening across military institutions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is government censorship, plain and simple.

The move follows Trump\\u2019s executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing \\u201CDEI\\u201D initiatives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s dismantling of DEI priorities is directly gutting federal efforts to protect marginalized communities.
