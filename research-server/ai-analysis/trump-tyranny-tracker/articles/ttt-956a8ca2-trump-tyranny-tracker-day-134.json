Clary/AFP/Getty Images Share\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: June 2Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Don\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsThe Trump Organization Has Expanded Globally Since the 2024 Election. See WhereWhat Happened: Since Trump\u2019s re-election, the Trump Organization has announced 12 new overseas projects\u2014more than double from before. These include government-backed deals in Qatar, UAE, India, and Serbia, such as a $500 million hotel on Serbian government land and a $2 billion crypto venture with the UAE.Why It Matters: Trump continues selling access and America. Foreign governments are buying influence while Trump and his family profit. It\u2019s the most blatant corruption.Source: Wall Street JournalCrypto Bros Celebrate Themselves at Bitcoin\u2019s Most MAGA Convention YetWhat Happened: The Bitcoin 2025 convention in Las Vegas became a MAGA celebration, with crypto billionaires flaunting their role in reelecting Trump. J.D. Vance headlined the event, bragging about firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler and dismantling crypto oversight.Why It Matters: The crypto industry has fused with Trump\u2019s agenda, trading deregulation for loyalty. With Pepe memes and Trump merch everywhere, Bitcoin 2025 marked the full capture of crypto by the far right.Source: Rolling StoneBudget bill would add trillions to U.S. debt and increase inequality, Nobel laureate economists sayWhat Happened: 6 Nobel Prize-winning economists warned that Trump\u2019s budget bill would gut Medicaid and food stamps, increase debt by over $3 trillion, and fuel inflation and inequality, despite GOP lies that it would boost growth.Why It Matters: The plan redistributes wealth upward through deep safety-net cuts and tax breaks for the rich. Economists say it threatens economic stability and would burden millions of low-income Americans.Source: CBS NewsTrump\u2019s $5 Million \u201cGold Card\u201d Offers Wealthy Fast-Track to U.S. ResidencyWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s \u201cGold Card\u201d program offers permanent U.S. residency to foreigners who pay $5 million. Marketed as a red-carpet fast lane for the ultra-rich, the card includes VIP perks and lighter tax obligations\u2014but offers no investment returns.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s immigration scheme is a blueprint for corruption\u2014legalizing pay-to-play favoritism that rewards oligarchs. It mirrors foreign \u201cGolden Visa\u201d programs scrapped for abuse, turning U.S. immigration into a marketplace for the rich.Source: NPR\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsGabbard Eyes Fox News-Style Briefings to Appease TrumpWhat Happened: Tulsi Gabbard is exploring turning the President\u2019s Daily Brief into a Fox News-style video with flashy graphics and possibly even a network personality presenter. Trump has taken the brief less than once a week and is known to avoid reading long reports.Why It Matters: Warping intelligence to fit Trump\u2019s media obsessions\u2014while purging analysts who tell the truth\u2014is not just dangerous, it\u2019s insane. This guts the integrity of U.S. intelligence and replaces national security with propaganda.Source: NBC NewsTop U.S. Cyber Agency Faces Staff and Funding Cuts in New BudgetWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget proposes cutting $495 million from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and purging 1,000 jobs\u2014nearly a third of its staff. Programs tied to election security and disinformation monitoring will be gutted or shut down entirely.Why It Matters: The move drastically weakens U.S. cyber defenses amid rising global threats. Dismantling CISA\u2019s election programs opens the door to foreign interference, especially with the 2026 midterms approaching.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump to prioritize \u2018patriotic Americans\u2019 for federal jobsWhat Happened: Trump will require job applicants for most federal positions to submit essays explaining how they will advance Trump\u2019s policy agenda. The move is part of an overhaul to prioritize \u201cpatriotic Americans\u201d and replace career officials with loyalists.Why It Matters: The move guts merit-based hiring and rigs the civil service for MAGA loyalists\u2014banning demographic data, blacklisting top universities, and favoring recruits from conservative, religious, and military institutions as part of Trump\u2019s broader takeover of federal agencies.Source: Politico\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsUnease at F.B.I. Intensifies as Patel Ousts Top OfficialsWhat Happened: Kash Patel is forcing out senior officials, demoting others, and using polygraph tests to root out leaks and enforce loyalty. Patel and Dan Bongino are rapidly reshaping the bureau, targeting agents tied to past Trump investigations and prioritizing immigration and conservative grievances.Why It Matters: Trump is purging experts and stacking the FBI with loyalists, turning it into a political tool. Agents are pushed out, polygraphs are used to root out dissent, and decades of expertise are wiped out. It\u2019s a classic authoritarian tactic.Source: New York TimesFTC Targets Ad Watchdogs for Alleged Boycott Collusion Against Musk\u2019s XWhat Happened: The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a dozen advocacy and ad groups\u2014including Media Matters and Ad Fontes Media\u2014for allegedly coordinating advertiser boycotts of Elon Musk\u2019s X platform and other right-wing sites. The probe, led by new Trump-appointed FTC chair Andrew Ferguson, focuses on potential \u201cantitrust violations.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is another political crackdown on watchdogs that expose hate speech and disinformation. The FTC\u2019s shift reframes boycotts\u2014a core First Amendment tool\u2014as antitrust threats, turning decades of free speech precedent on its head.

Apple plans to move production to India; Mattel warned that tariffs will increase toy prices.Why It Matters: Trump is using tariffs to strong-arm U.S. companies\u2014an authoritarian overreach into the private sector with no legal basis. It\u2019s more about demanding public loyalty than sound policy, and the fallout will chill investment and shake confidence in doing business in the U.S.Source: CNNJustice Dept. Capitol Siege Section head Greg Rosen resigns, says Trump Jan. 6 pardons sent \"terrible message\"What Happened: Greg Rosen, head of the DOJ\u2019s Capitol Siege Section, resigned and condemned Trump\u2019s mass pardons of January 6 insurrectionists, calling them a \u201cterrible message\u201d that condones political violence. He also criticized the demotions and firings of prosecutors who secured convictions.Why It Matters: Rosen\u2019s exit highlights the collapse of the rule of law under Trump. Pardoning insurrectionists and gutting the DOJ team that held them accountable politicizes justice and greenlights political violence.Source: CBS NewsHomeland Security stonewalling info on noncitizen DNA collection operation, lawsuit allegesWhat Happened: Three advocacy groups sued the Department of Homeland Security for withholding records on its massive DNA collection program targeting noncitizens. Under Trump\u2019s 2020 order, DHS contributions to the FBI\u2019s DNA database have surged 5,000%, including data from individuals accused of no crime.Why It Matters: Advocates warn the program enables a sweeping, unchecked surveillance dragnet that could expand beyond immigrants, normalizing biometric targeting without transparency or oversight.Source: NBC NewsTrump Orders California to End Trans Athlete RuleWhat Happened: The DOJ, under Civil Rights Division head Harmeet Dhillon, ordered California\u2019s high school sports authority to bar transgender girls from girls\u2019 teams, calling the policy unconstitutional. This came after a trans athlete won two state titles and Trump threatened to cut funding.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing civil rights law to justify exclusion\u2014redefining equal protection to strip away protections and permit state-sanctioned discrimination.Source: BloombergTrump Tyranny Tracker is a reader-supported publication.

Arrests have surged to 1,600 a day, with Stephen Miller pushing for 3,000 daily.Why It Matters: ICE is operating with growing secrecy and force, echoing authoritarian crackdowns. Shielding identities and blocking transparency erodes the democratic oversight vital to civil liberties and essential to a functioning democracy.Source: Associated PressPro-Trump Reporter Fired After Criticizing HegsethWhat Happened: Gabrielle Cuccia, Pentagon propagandist for pro-Trump outlet OAN, says she was fired after criticizing Pete Hegseth\u2019s press restrictions. She accused his team of hypocrisy, leaking selectively while tightening access.Why It Matters: Cuccia\u2019s ouster reveals deepening media suppression under Trump\u2014even among loyalist outlets. Dissent from the far right is no longer tolerated, signaling growing authoritarian control over messaging.Source: The GuardianRed states tell colleges: Race and gender classes are out, civics inWhat Happened: Lawmakers in Utah, Ohio, and Florida passed laws mandating civics and Western civilization courses in colleges while eliminating race and gender studies from general education. The new rules require state-approved readings and ban diversity and inclusion programs.Why It Matters: This is a political takeover of public education. Faculty say it's gutting academic freedom and rewriting history to fit a narrow, state-imposed ideology\u2014another classic tactic in authoritarian regimes.Source: Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsICE arrest of H.S. student sends shockwaves through a Massachusetts townWhat Happened: Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, an 18-year-old student-athlete who\u2019s lived in Milford, MA since age 6, was arrested by ICE during a traffic stop just before his graduation. Though not the original target, agents detained him after learning of his immigration status.Why It Matters: The arrest sparked community outrage, with protests from students, teachers, and local officials. Critics, including the governor, called it a cruel and unnecessary disruption of a young man\u2019s future. Gomes Da Silva remains in ICE custody as legal efforts continue.Source: NBC NewsPastors Arrested for Capitol Prayer Protest Against Trump Medicaid CutsWhat Happened: Rev. William Barber and several clergy were arrested in the Capitol Rotunda after holding a prayer protest against Medicaid cuts in Trump\u2019s bill.

Now, They\u2019re Being Erased by Immigration Courts.What Happened: At least 14 Venezuelan asylum seekers, disappeared without due process to El Salvador\u2019s gulag, have had their U.S. immigration cases dismissed. Many were accused of \u201cgang ties\u201d based on tattoos but had no criminal history or final removal orders.Why It Matters: Judges are terminating their cases, making it nearly impossible to return or challenge their unlawful disappearance and lack of due process.Source: Mother JonesDiscrimination cases unravel as Trump scraps core civil rights tenetWhat Happened: Trump declared \u201cdisparate impact\u201d analysis unconstitutional, prompting the DOJ and Education Department to dismiss dozens of civil rights cases across housing, policing, lending, and education. Existing agreements tied to George Floyd\u2019s death, Native student mistreatment, and bank redlining are being torn up.Why It Matters: Disparate impact has been a cornerstone of civil rights enforcement for decades. Eliminating it dismantles protections against systemic discrimination, erases legal tools that hold institutions accountable, and guts civil rights infrastructure from within.Source: Washington PostBorder Officials Told Not to Attend Events Tied to Diversity in Law EnforcementWhat Happened: A March 2025 Trump memo barred Border Patrol and Customs officers from attending law enforcement events centered on race, gender, or culture\u2014targeting organizations like NOBLE and Women in Federal Law Enforcement. The order cited Trump\u2019s broader executive ban on federal diversity programs.Why It Matters: Critics, including a senior CBP official who resigned in protest, say the policy is discriminatory and undermines public trust. Source: New York TimesAt least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics shutter amid political turbulenceWhat Happened: At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics across seven states have closed or announced closures in 2025 due to massive funding losses. Trump froze Title X funds, escalated Medicaid defunding efforts, and pushed a tax bill targeting abortion providers.Why It Matters: These closures slash access to reproductive care, STI testing, contraception, and cancer screenings, especially for low-income patients. With Medicaid cuts looming and SCOTUS reviewing state bans, more shutdowns are expected.Source: The GuardianMass Deportation Effort Sweeps Up U.S. Citizen Children with Deported ParentsWhat Happened: Trump is deporting U.S. citizen children alongside their undocumented parents, often without legal counsel and under coercive conditions. Parents report being pressured into signing removal orders, with some families forced to leave behind critically ill children.Why It Matters: These deportations violate ICE\u2019s own protocols and endanger vulnerable kids\u2014including a 4-year-old with cancer and a 10-year-old post-brain surgery. Legal experts and lawmakers warn that the policy deprives U.S. citizens of due process and abandons families in unsafe conditions.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchInsurers, states warn of Obamacare chaos due to GOP megabillWhat Happened: A hidden clause in House Republicans\u2019 megabill ties federal payments to insurers to abortion exclusions, clashing with mandates in 12 states and D.C.

Many employees took him seriously, deepening panic inside an agency already rocked by purges and low morale.Why It Matters: With hurricane season approaching, FEMA is being hollowed out. Richardson\u2019s comment highlights the danger of Trump\u2019s unqualified appointments and the collapse of expertise in life-and-death agencies.Source: CBS NewsRFK Jr. is struggling to keep his promise to protect Native Americans from health cutsWhat Happened: Despite promises to protect Native health, HHS has made major cuts to non-IHS federal health programs\u2014slashing grants, firing support staff, and canceling initiatives for Native youth and chronic disease prevention.Why It Matters: While IHS was spared, vital programs that tribes rely on for public health, housing, overdose prevention, and data access were gutted\u2014jeopardizing care for thousands and risking lives in already underserved communities.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchPentagon to redraw command map to more closely \u201calign\u201d Greenland with the USWhat Happened: The Pentagon will move Greenland from European Command to U.S. Northern Command, \u201caligning\u201d the island more closely with U.S. territory amid Trump\u2019s escalating annexation threats to take control of the Danish territory.
