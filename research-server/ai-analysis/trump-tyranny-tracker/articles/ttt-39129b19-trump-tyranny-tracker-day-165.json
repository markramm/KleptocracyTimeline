Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for SEIUShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: July 3Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Authoritarianism 101: How It Happens \u2014 And How We Fight Back with Zev and Olga Session 6Google Meet: July 8, 2025 @8:00 PM ESTJoin Zev Shalev and me for a relaxed, interactive session breaking down the basics of authoritarian rule\u2014how it works, how it spreads, and what we can do to fight back. This is the 2nd in a summer series of Google Meet conversations for our paid subscribers. Bring your questions and insights.Paid subscribers to either Zev\u2019s or my newsletter are invited.Registration Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefgGSBQSNgZEoVyn2C3ZwRC1vEsktwe_3Li72CziHh0UiBog/viewform?usp=header\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump\u2019s FCC Scraps Ban on Prison Phone Price Gouging, Rewarding Major DonorsWhat Happened: The FCC scrapped Obama and Biden-era rules that capped prison phone rates and banned kickbacks to prison operators, gutting protections from the Martha Wright-Reed Act. The rollback reopens the door to exploitative fees that once cost families nearly $1 billion a year. It directly benefits Trump mega-donors like GEO Group and CoreCivic, who profit from these predatory practices and maintain deep financial ties and contracts with the regime.Why It Matters: This is naked corruption. Trump is letting prison companies involved in his mass detention/deportation agenda gouge families to reward his donors. Source: Mother JonesRepublican Votes for Budget After Dumping Medicaid-Related StockWhat Happened: GOP Rep. Robert Bresnahan sold shares in Centene\u2014a Medicaid provider\u2014just before voting for a Trump budget bill that slashed healthcare funding. After the vote, Centene\u2019s stock plunged 43%. Bresnahan's trade shielded him from personal financial losses directly tied to the legislation.Why It Matters: More insider trading. Bresnahan cashed in while gutting healthcare for millions. It\u2019s blatant self-dealing\u2014lawmakers profiting off policies that hurt the very people they\u2019re elected to serve.Source: The New Republic\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump Claims Sweeping Power to Nullify Laws, Letters on TikTok Ban ShowWhat Happened: Newly uncovered Justice Department letters reveal that Trump claimed sweeping constitutional powers to override a bipartisan law banning TikTok. AG Pam Bondi told tech firms they could ignore the law without penalty, asserting Trump\u2019s national security authority supersedes the statute.Why It Matters: Trump is asserting the power to unilaterally nullify laws\u2014echoing a monarch\u2019s dispensing power. Legal scholars warn this defies the Constitution, which requires presidents to enforce laws, not erase them.

Despite the mission\u2019s classified nature, their attendance was confirmed, along with a military flyover.Why It Matters: Experts warn the exposure could endanger the pilots and their families, as adversaries may exploit their identities. The White House has not disclosed any security measures.Source: Military.comCBP Seeks New Tools to Deep-Scan Phones at U.S. BorderWhat Happened: U.S. Customs and Border Protection is seeking advanced tech to extract encrypted chats, find hidden data, and analyze massive datasets from seized phones and laptops. Device searches topped 47,000 in 2024, and CBP already uses tools like Cellebrite but wants even deeper forensic reach.Why It Matters: This is a sweeping expansion of border surveillance. With no warrant required and data stored for up to 15 years, the tools will target travelers for their political views and scan sensitive content, turning routine crossings into constitution-free zones.Source: WIRED200 Marines among those being sent to Florida to help ICEWhat Happened: Trump is deploying 200 active-duty Marines to Florida to support ICE near the \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d detention site. The Marines, from New River base in North Carolina, will operate under ICE command in what officials call a logistical support role.Why It Matters: Trump continues to blur the line between military and civilian authority. Deploying active-duty troops for domestic immigration enforcement is a dangerous abuse of power\u2014and a form of conditioning Americans to accept military force as a tool of internal control.Source: ABC NewsSome education grants in limbo were used for \u2018leftwing agenda,\u2019 Trump administration saysWhat Happened: Trump froze over $6 billion in federal education grants, claiming the funds were used to support undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ programs. The freeze affects services like English instruction and after-school care.Why It Matters: Millions of low-income and immigrant children will lose vital education support. It\u2019s part of a broader crackdown designed to punish the vulnerable and enforce ideological conformity\u2014turning public education into a tool of political control.Source: Associated PressSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsFormer CBS anchor slams Paramount settlement with Trump: \u2018It was a sellout\u2019What Happened: Dan Rather condemned Paramount\u2019s $16 million settlement with Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, calling it \u201ca sad day for journalism.\u201d Trump had sued CBS for alleged \u201celection interference,\u201d a case widely seen as baseless. The funds will reportedly go to Trump\u2019s future presidential library.Why It Matters: The settlement sets a dangerous precedent\u2014rewarding legal intimidation and pressuring news outlets to capitulate to political power. Rather warned it was a corporate cave-in that undermines journalistic independence and emboldens control over the press.Source: The GuardianEPA puts on leave 139 employees who spoke out against policies under TrumpWhat Happened: The EPA placed 139 staffers on administrative leave after they signed a \u201cdeclaration of dissent\u201d accusing the agency of abandoning its mission to protect health and the environment. The EPA called the move \u201cunlawful sabotage\u201d and launched an investigation. Over 270 employees signed the letter, including many anonymously.Why It Matters: Trump is purging career scientists for prioritizing facts over subservience\u2014silencing those who oppose policies that harm public health and the environment. Expertise is being replaced with obedience, turning science into a political weapon.Source: Associated PressConservative Group Files Civil Rights Complaint Against Dodgers Over DEI HiringWhat Happened: America First Legal, founded by Trump ally Stephen Miller, filed a federal civil rights complaint accusing the L.A. Dodgers and Guggenheim Partners of discriminatory hiring practices under their DEI policies. The complaint alleges white men are being unfairly excluded and calls for a federal investigation.Why It Matters: This is part of a broader right-wing assault on corporate diversity programs\u2014and clear retaliation after the Dodgers blocked ICE agents from their stadium and pledged a donation to an immigrant support fund. Source: KTLAColumbia Cyberattack Appears Politically Motivated, University SaysWhat Happened: A cyberattack crippled Columbia University\u2019s systems and exposed data from millions of student applications. A pro-Trump \u201chacktivist\u201d hijacked campus monitors with a smiling image of Trump, claiming the attack aimed to expose affirmative action practices. The hacker says they stole 460GB of sensitive data, including Social Security numbers, financial aid records, university ID numbers, and citizenship status.Why It Matters: This was a targeted political attack by sophisticated hackers aiming to punish Columbia. With Trump freezing research funds and escalating pressure on universities, this breach is part of a broader war on higher education, driven by ideology and intimidation.Source: New York Times\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsAfter 47 years in the US, Ice took this Iranian mother from her yard. Her family just wants her homeWhat Happened: Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother and New Orleans community volunteer, was arrested by ICE agents in plainclothes from her front yard. In the U.S. since 1978, she has no criminal record and a long history of compliance with immigration rules. Her detention came shortly after Trump ordered strikes on Iran, amid a wave of ICE crackdowns targeting Iranians.Why It Matters: Trump continues his war on immigrant communities, detaining elderly, long-settled residents with no criminal record. The use of masked agents and unmarked cars without warning is straight out of the authoritarian playbook and should concern everyone.Source: The GuardianICE shut down this Latino market \u2014 without even showing upWhat Happened: The Broadacres Marketplace in North Las Vegas abruptly shut down amid fear of an ICE raid, despite no agents appearing. The panic followed a similar operation at another California market, leaving hundreds of Latino vendors suddenly without income.Why It Matters: Communities are being economically crippled not just by raids\u2014but by the looming threat of them. Legal residents are hiding, businesses are shuttering, and entire neighborhoods are falling silent from fear.Source: NBC NewsUS supreme court clears way for deportations of eight men to South SudanWhat Happened: The Supreme Court gave Trump the green light to deport eight men to war-torn South Sudan\u2014even though most aren\u2019t from there\u2014overturning a lower court that demanded proof they wouldn\u2019t be tortured or killed. The men, held at a U.S. base in Djibouti, include immigrants from Cuba, Myanmar, and Vietnam.Why It Matters: This ruling guts asylum protections and sets a dangerous precedent: migrants can now be deported to countries they\u2019re not from\u2014even if they face torture or death. It\u2019s an assault on basic human rights, sanctioned by the highest court.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch\u2018It\u2019s Harsh, Mean, Brutal\u2019: Trump\u2019s Budget Bill Deals Crushing Blow to America\u2019s PoorestWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s budget slashes $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, SNAP, and ACA subsidies while extending $3 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy. The poorest Americans lose up to $1,600 per household, while the top 0.1% gain over $100,000. The CBO says it will add $3.3 trillion to the debt.Why It Matters: Millions lose healthcare and food aid so billionaires can pocket more. Trump\u2019s promise that \u201cno one will be hurt\u201d is a lie\u2014this bill punishes the poor to reward the wealthy.Source: The Guardian'A slap in the face': Georgia and Arkansas' Medicaid work rules may preview the road aheadWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s bill imposes nationwide Medicaid work requirements, echoing failed programs in Georgia and Arkansas. Thousands lost coverage there\u2014including caregivers, gig workers, and students\u2014due to confusing rules and red tape, often without knowing until they needed care.Why It Matters: This is about ripping healthcare from the vulnerable. Under the guise of fighting \u201cfraud,\u201d Trump is punishing the working poor and chronically ill, leading to more debt, untreated illness, and needless suffering.Source: NBC NewsRFK Jr.'s FDA officials overrode career staff to limit COVID shotsWhat Happened: Top FDA officials appointed under RFK Jr. overruled career scientists to restrict full approval of COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax and Moderna. The agency narrowed Novavax\u2019s use to only seniors and high-risk individuals, despite internal staff recommending broader approval for ages 12 and up.Why It Matters: The override reflects a growing politicization of vaccine policy under RFK Jr. and Trump. Experts warn it will undermine public health trust and access to vaccines as a fall COVID wave looms.Source: CBS NewsFears in Massachusetts that Trump\u2019s bill could unravel health safety netWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s newly passed bill could strip insurance from up to 100,000 residents enrolled in Massachusetts\u2019 Health Connector, undermining a system once considered the model for Obamacare. The bill imposes tighter documentation rules and slashes ACA tax credits and Medicaid funding.Why It Matters: Advocates warn the changes will devastate low-income and marginalized communities. They say it unravels decades of progress and risks lives while destabilizing the state\u2019s health care safety net.Source: Associated PressScientists warn US will lose a generation of talent because of Trump cutsWhat Happened: Unauthorized DOGE operatives have taken over the National Science Foundation\u2019s peer-review process, vetoing grants and terminating over 1,600 projects\u2014especially those related to climate, public health, and diversity. Expert panels are being overridden, and research is being abruptly canceled, with blue states and top universities like Harvard hit hardest.Why It Matters: This is a MAGA purge of science. By politicizing research funding, Trump\u2019s regime is gutting climate and health innovation, driving scientists abroad, and handing long-term leadership in tech and science to rivals like China. Source: The GuardianWhy staffing cuts to national parks could pose safety concerns for summer visitorsWhat Happened: Lifeguard towers at Maryland\u2019s Assateague Island are shuttered as staffing shortages hit national parks nationwide. Trump\u2019s hiring freeze and a 24% cut to permanent Park Service staff have left beaches unguarded and seasonal roles unfilled, prompting safety concerns from local leaders.Why It Matters: Millions visit parks like Assateague every summer. Without lifeguards or emergency personnel, drownings and injuries are more likely. A proposed $1 billion budget cut to the Park Service next year will deepen the crisis.Source: CBS News\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchMultiple Countries Issue Travel Warnings for the U.S.What Happened: Allies like Australia, Canada, the U.K., and several European nations have issued travel warnings for the U.S., citing gun violence, mass shootings, civil unrest, immigration enforcement, and discriminatory entry practices\u2014especially toward nonbinary travelers.Why It Matters: The U.S. is no longer seen as a universally safe destination. With rising domestic instability, tourism is taking a hit\u2014costing an estimated $12.5 billion in lost revenue in 2025 alone. The warnings show a global reputational decline under Trump\u2019s leadership.Source: Yahoo NewsTrump Signs Order to Raise National Park Fees for Foreign VisitorsWhat Happened: Trump signed an executive order mandating higher entry fees at U.S. national parks for foreign tourists, while simultaneously pushing to slash the National Park Service budget by over $1 billion\u2014more than a third of its funding. The order also prioritizes U.S. residents for permits and reservations.Why It Matters: The move burdens foreign visitors while understaffing, service cuts, and closures already strain parks nationwide. It\u2019s a political stunt that won\u2019t fix Trump\u2019s degradation of park safety and access.Source: Reuters\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchKremlin Gloats Over U.S. Weapons Pause to UkraineWhat Happened: The U.S. paused key weapons deliveries to Ukraine, including 30 Patriot missiles, sparking Kremlin celebration. Russian officials seized on the decision to mock U.S. priorities and claim Ukraine\u2019s defense is faltering.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aid pause hands Putin another victory and cripples Ukraine\u2019s defenses against Russia\u2019s escalating missile onslaught. It proves Moscow\u2019s gamble was right\u2014they wanted Trump back because he\u2019d abandon Ukraine. Now, the U.S. is doing just that, effectively aiding Russia\u2019s genocide.Source: Defense OneSenate Democrats Launch Investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia Sanctions FreezeWhat Happened: Senate Democrats announced an investigation into Trump\u2019s five-month halt on new sanctions against Russia, calling it a failure to pressure Putin\u2019s genocidal war machine. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of wanting to \u201cend\u201d the war in Ukraine, his regime has blocked sanctions updates and paused key weapons shipments.Why It Matters: The freeze undermines U.S. leverage and enables global sanction evaders to keep arming Russia. Lawmakers warn this signals a dangerous appeasement of Putin and jeopardizes both Ukraine\u2019s survival and U.S. national security.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsLayoffs reach highest level since 2020, new data shows. Here's why companies are cutting jobs.What Happened: U.S. layoffs surged to 744,000 in the first half of 2025\u2014the worst since the early COVID crisis. The driving force is Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE, which purged nearly 287,000 federal jobs. Tech, retail, media, nonprofits, and government agencies have all been hit hard.Why It Matters: Trump is dismantling public institutions and forcing mass purges across sectors. At the same time, his erratic tariffs are destabilizing the private sector\u2014fueling economic insecurity.Source: CBS NewsAnalysis shows Trump\u2019s tariffs would cost US employers $82.3 billionWhat Happened: A new JPMorgan Chase Institute report shows Trump\u2019s tariff plans would cost mid-sized U.S. businesses $82.3 billion. Retailers and wholesalers, especially those importing from China, India, and Thailand, would bear the brunt\u2014 triggering price hikes or layoffs.Why It Matters: These tariffs will hit American businesses and workers, raising prices and slashing jobs\u2014especially in vulnerable sectors. With only one trade deal in place, the pain is just beginning.Source: Associated PressWall Street Worries as Crisis-Level Deficits Become the Government\u2019s Default ModeWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s tax-and-spending law adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit, locking in permanent tax cuts while gutting safety net programs. With no economic emergency to justify it, the U.S. debt is projected to hit 130% of GDP by 2034.Why It Matters: Wall Street is worried, bond yields are surging, and the dollar is sliding. Trump\u2019s policies risk crippling America\u2019s ability to respond to real crises\u2014and could trigger inflation, recession, or a market crash.Source: Wall Street Journal\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Hakeem Jeffries Breaks Record for Longest House Speech in Protest of Trump\u2019s BillWhat Happened: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for 8 hours and 44 minutes overnight, setting a new record for the longest House speech in U.S. history. His marathon protest aimed to delay a vote on Trump\u2019s tax and spending bill, which includes brutal Medicaid cuts and $170 billion for immigration enforcement.Source: TIME175+ Democrats Back NAACP Lawsuit to Block Trump\u2019s Dismantling of Education DeptWhat Happened: Over 175 Democratic lawmakers, led by Elizabeth Warren and Jamie Raskin, filed a legal brief supporting the NAACP\u2019s lawsuit against Trump\u2019s attempt to abolish the Department of Education. The suit challenges mass purges, funding freezes, and program terminations as unconstitutional power grabs.Source: ABC NewsDC Archbishop Slams Trump Megabill, Immigration CrackdownWhat Happened: Washington\u2019s Cardinal Robert McElroy condemned Trump\u2019s immigration raids and \u201cinhumane\u201d deportation agenda, accusing him of ripping families apart.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. Corruption Is the Business Model \u2014 From insider stock trades to billion-dollar kickbacks for prison telecoms and military contractors, Trump\u2019s regime is designed to reward donors, punish the poor, and enrich insiders at every level.Science Is Under Siege \u2014 Musk\u2019s unauthorized DOGE has hijacked the National Science Foundation and Trump is purging hundreds of career scientists at the EPA.

The rollback reopens the door to exploitative fees that once cost families nearly $1 billion a year. It directly benefits Trump mega-donors like GEO Group and CoreCivic, who profit from these predatory practices and maintain deep financial ties and contracts with the regime.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is naked corruption.
