REUTERS/Carlos BarriaShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 8Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsHow RFK Jr. Is Boosting \u2018Food Babe\u2019 and Other MAHA AcolytesWhat Happened: RFK Jr. is facing scrutiny for publicly elevating wellness influencers and companies aligned with his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement. These figures, including Vani Hari (\u201cFood Babe\u201d) and Mark Hyman, have business ties that benefit from RFK Jr.\u2019s policy announcements and public appearances.Why It Matters: RFK Jr. is surrounding himself with allies who stand to profit from their proximity to his position. Ethics experts say it skirts legal boundaries while blurring the line between public service and private enrichment.Source: Wall Street JournalDemocrats Block Stablecoin Bill Over Trump\u2019s Crypto ProfitsWhat Happened: Senate Democrats blocked a stablecoin regulation bill, warning it could help Trump and his allies profit from crypto ventures. The bill aimed to create federal rules for stablecoins but lacked safeguards against political self-enrichment.Why It Matters: Trump launched a meme coin, promoted pay-for-access crypto events, and backed a family-linked stablecoin tied to a $2 billion UAE deal. Democrats say the bill would legalize corruption unless it bars elected officials from owning or promoting crypto assets.Source: Associated PressTrump\u2019s Middle East trip will take him to 3 countries with Trump-branded projectsWhat Happened: Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar\u2014three countries with Trump-branded properties or active development deals. These include golf courses, luxury residences, and hotel projects tied to powerful state-linked developers like DAMAC Properties and Saudi-based Dar Global. Some of the ventures involve direct partnerships with foreign governments.Why It Matters: Trump is running U.S. foreign policy like a personal business empire (like in Russia). His deals with foreign governments turn diplomacy into a global bribery scheme, where access and influence go to the highest bidder. It\u2019s blatant corruption and a national security threat.Source: CREW\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsJeanine Pirro Named D.C. Interim U.S. AttorneyWhat Happened: Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for D.C. after Ed Martin\u2019s nomination collapsed amid backlash over his support for January 6 rioters. Martin will now lead Trump\u2019s new \u201cWeaponization Working Group\u201d at the DOJ.Why It Matters: Trump is stacking the Justice Department with loyalists to protect allies and carry out retribution against opponents. Expertise isn\u2019t a factor\u2014seasoned professionals are being purged and replaced with loyal foot soldiers who will do his bidding without question.Source: ReutersJeanine Pirro\u2019s Fox Producer Thought She Was \u201cNuts.\u201d Trump Just Named Her DC\u2019s Top ProsecutorWhat Happened: Trump appointed Fox News host and longtime loyalist Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Internal Fox communications show her executive producer describing her as a \u201creckless maniac\u201d who is \u201cnuts,\u201d promotes \u201cconspiracy theories,\u201d and \u201cshould never be on live television.\u201d Why It Matters: Pirro\u2019s appointment\u2014another conspiracy-peddling loyalist with no recent legal experience\u2014reiterates Trump\u2019s goals of controlling the Justice Department, using it as a political weapon to target his perceived enemies, protect his allies, and criminalize dissent.Source: Media MattersLeader of FEMA Is Fired as Trump Pushes to Dismantle AgencyWhat Happened: Acting FEMA chief Cameron Hamilton was fired one day after telling Congress the agency was vital to disaster response and should not be eliminated, directly contradicting Trump and Kristi Noem, who want to abolish FEMA.Why It Matters: Hamilton was fired for telling the truth. Now, FEMA is leaderless, understaffed, and underfunded just weeks before hurricane season. Trump demands blind loyalty and, as a result, will put lives at risk.Source: New York TimesDOGE-Led Software Revamp to Speed US Job Cuts Even as Musk Steps BackWhat Happened: The Office of Personnel Management, guided by Elon Musk, has revamped a Pentagon-developed layoff software, now rebranded as the \"Workforce Reshaping Tool.\" It\u2019s designed to rapidly process mass purges of federal employees.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk plan to use Pentagon software to purge thousands of federal workers. It's a blueprint for dismantling the civil service and consolidating control.Source: Reuters\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Fires Librarian of CongressWhat Happened: Dr. Carla D. Hayden, the first African American and first woman to lead the Library of Congress, was abruptly fired via email by Trump officials without explanation. She was appointed by President Obama in 2016 and served throughout Trump\u2019s first term.Why It Matters: Hayden\u2019s removal marks another aggressive Trump move to reshape American cultural and intellectual institutions, furthering his extremist agenda against diversity, historical truth, and academic independence. Her firing follows book bans and the political purging of U.S. cultural landmarks.Source: New York TimesJustice Department Targets Letitia James in Trump-Era Retaliation ProbeWhat Happened: The DOJ has launched a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James over alleged \u201cmisrepresentations on mortgage paperwork\u201d for a Norfolk, VA property. Trump-appointed housing official William Pulte referred the case, claiming James falsely stated it would be her primary residence.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the DOJ to launch a criminal probe into one of his top adversaries, who led the historic fraud case against him and blocked multiple policies. Her lawyer called the investigation \u201cpolitical retribution,\u201d with clear evidence that the disputed property was intended for her niece. Retaliation begins. Source: Washington PostAgency Moves to Fire a Judge Who Rejected a Trump DirectiveWhat Happened: Karen Ortiz, a longtime administrative judge at the EEOC, was placed on leave and is being targeted for termination after criticizing Trump\u2019s order to halt discrimination investigations involving transgender people. In February, Ortiz emailed 1,000 colleagues condemning the directive as \u201cillegal and unethical\u201d and urging the agency\u2019s acting chair to resign.Why It Matters: Ortiz is being targeted for upholding civil rights and refusing to bow to Trump\u2019s agenda. It\u2019s part of a broader authoritarian crackdown\u2014using executive power to expel anyone who defends the rule of law and erase protections that stand in the regime\u2019s way.Source: New York TimesTrump Invokes State Secrets in Abrego Garcia Deportation CaseWhat Happened: Trump invoked the rarely used state secrets privilege to block the release of documents related to the disappearance of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, defying a court order mandating his return to the U.S. Why It Matters: The DOJ is using \u201cstate secrets\u201d to cover up an illegal disappearance and defy court orders. Trump\u2019s blatant contempt for the judiciary shows a dangerous abuse of power, using secrecy to shield unlawful actions and erase accountability.Source: CBS NewsRFK Jr. Launches Autism Data Project Using Medicare, Medicaid InfoWhat Happened: The NIH is creating a \u201creal-world data platform\u201d to research autism causes using Medicare and Medicaid data, electronic medical records, and wearables.Why It Matters: Privacy advocates and autism researchers are alarmed. Critics fear the project will morph into a national autism registry (which RFK Jr. pitched) and be misused, especially given RFK Jr.\u2019s long-debunked conspiracy theories linking vaccines to autism and promises to \u201ceradicate\u201d the condition.Source: NPRUS Says It Is Probing Foreign Donations at University of PennsylvaniaWhat Happened: The Department of Education launched an investigation into the University of Pennsylvania over allegedly \u201cinaccurate and untimely disclosures of foreign donations.\u201d The department is demanding tax records, foreign contracts, and details on university personnel tied to foreign governments dating back to 2017.Why It Matters: Trump is using federal power to punish elite universities\u2014weaponizing investigations to silence dissent and enforce ideological control. This assault on education is part of a broader agenda to crush student activism and preempt resistance.Source: ReutersSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsThe Warped Reality of the Elites Shaping Trump\u2019s AdministrationWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s second-term agenda is being driven by a tight circle of far-right ideologues\u2014like JD Vance, Pete Hegseth, and Michael Anton\u2014who view America\u2019s institutions as captured by a \u201cleftist enemy.\u201d Shaped by echo chambers and grievance politics, they see universities, the media, and the government as threats to be dismantled, not reformed.Why It Matters: These extremists aren\u2019t on the sidelines\u2014they\u2019re running the government. Their paranoia is now policy, driving attacks on universities, politicizing the military, and fueling a broader effort to dismantle democracy from within.Source: VoxJournalist Sues Trump Over VOA Shutdown, Urges Media to \u2018Fight Back\u2019What Happened: Patsy Widakuswara, White House bureau chief at Voice of America, is leading a lawsuit against Trump after an executive order defunded and dismantled the broadcaster. The order halted operations, placed over 1,000 staff on leave, and terminated 600 contractors. Although a court issued a temporary injunction, VOA remains shut down as the government continues to appeal.Why It Matters: Trump is silencing independent journalism \u2014shutting down a global media agency to suppress coverage he labels \u201canti-Trump.\u201d Like any dictator, he knows that controlling the media and the narrative is key to consolidating power. Widakuswara calls it what it is: a direct assault on the First Amendment and a warning to all journalists. Kari Lake recently announced that VOA will air propaganda from far-right outlet OAN.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsThe Pentagon\u2019s Culture Wars Hit West PointWhat Happened: Pete Hegseth ordered West Point to purge \u201cdivisive\u201d content, resulting in banned books, canceled classes, and a mandate to present a sanitized, pro-American narrative. Works by Black authors like Toni Morrison and Ta-Nehisi Coates were removed, and faculty were pressured to avoid discussing racism and gender. Several professors have since resigned in protest.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s Pentagon is forcing military academies to rewrite history and suppress academic freedom, replacing honest education and historical facts with nationalist propaganda.Source: New York TimesUp to 1,000 Transgender Troops Being Expelled Under New Pentagon OrderWhat Happened: Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision allowing Trump\u2019s transgender military ban to proceed, Hegseth ordered the immediate separation of 1,000 transgender troops who had self-identified, with others given 30 days to come forward. The Pentagon will also review medical records to identify additional individuals for involuntary discharge.Why It Matters: This is the largest purge of LGBTQ+ service members in decades and a chilling rollback of civil rights. The policy enforces forced outing, strips troops of due process, and reduces their service to a political target\u2014echoing past eras of discrimination.Source: NBC NewsMigrants Are Skipping Medical Care, Fearing ICE, Doctors SayWhat Happened: Since Trump rescinded protections barring immigration enforcement at hospitals and clinics, a growing number of undocumented immigrants are avoiding or delaying urgent medical care, including for gunshot wounds, diabetes, and high-risk pregnancies, out of fear of deportation.Why It Matters: Medical professionals warn this will spark a public health crisis\u2014untreated illnesses, rising deaths, and soaring costs from preventable conditions. Clinics report sharp drops in patient visits and interpreter use, as ICE\u2019s presence creates a climate of fear that\u2019s driving immigrants away from life-saving care. Lives are on the line.Source: New York TimesTrump Declares High-Speed Internet Program \u2018Racist\u2019 and \u2018Unconstitutional\u2019What Happened: Trump attacked the Biden-era Digital Equity Act, calling it \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwoke handouts based on race,\u201d and vowed to end the program. The law, passed under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, aimed to expand broadband access for veterans, the elderly, disabled people, and low-income households.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s attack is part of a broader purge of equity programs, using race to divide the country and inflame his base. Despite the law\u2019s nondiscrimination clause, he\u2019s pushing to slash billions in broadband grants to red and blue states\u2014undermining expansion efforts and showing blatant contempt for the communities they\u2019re meant to protect.Source: New York TimesTrump Asks Supreme Court to Revoke Legal Status of 500,000 ImmigrantsWhat Happened: Trump asked the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision blocking his effort to revoke temporary legal status for over 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. These immigrants had been granted status under a Biden-era humanitarian program.Why It Matters: If the Court sides with Trump, hundreds of thousands of people\u2014many of whom have built lives in the U.S., could face deportation. The case challenges judicial oversight of executive immigration decisions, with broad implications for future humanitarian protections.Source: NBC News\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Cuts to AmeriCorps Causing \u201cDamage and Chaos,\u201d Groups SayWhat Happened: Trump abruptly terminated over 1,000 AmeriCorps grant programs, including projects serving impoverished communities and disaster-prone areas\u2014many in states that voted for Trump. Programs affected include child abuse prevention in Missouri, rural tutoring in Alaska, and flood relief in West Virginia.Why It Matters: The cuts are gutting vital services in low-income and rural areas, with lawsuits filed over staff layoffs and program disruptions. Groups warn the move is causing \u201cdamage and chaos,\u201d particularly in regions with the fewest resources.Source: CBS NewsMedicaid Payments Barely Keep Hospital Mental Health Units Afloat. Federal Cuts Could Sink ThemWhat Happened: Spencer Hospital in Iowa is one of the few remaining rural hospitals still operating an inpatient psychiatric unit, despite losing $2 million annually. Hospital leaders warn that proposed Medicaid cuts by Trump and Congress could force closures of already fragile mental health services nationwide.Why It Matters: Medicaid covers many with serious mental health needs, but pays hospitals less than private insurance. Further cuts could shut down more psych units, worsening a crisis that\u2019s already flooding ERs and jails. In Iowa, where most hospitals lack inpatient care, advocates warn of more untreated crises and preventable deaths.Source: NPR\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIntelligence Agencies Increase Focus on Greenland, U.S. Officials SayWhat Happened: U.S. intelligence agencies have increased surveillance of Greenland after Trump renewed rhetoric to illegally annex the island, and Vice President JD Vance visited a U.S. base there. A classified memo instructed agencies to gather intelligence on Greenland\u2019s independence movement and local sentiment toward U.S. resource extraction.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s obsession with Greenland is straining relations with Denmark and exposing U.S. spying on a NATO ally. It points to broader imperialist ambitions\u2014seizing resources while trampling on sovereignty and international law.Source: New York TimesTrump Snubs Traditional Allies, Heads to Saudi Arabia for First Major Foreign TripWhat Happened: Trump will make Saudi Arabia his first major foreign visit of his second term, just as he did in 2017, snubbing traditional allies. He\u2019ll also visit the UAE and Qatar, underscoring his focus on Middle Eastern wealth, personal deals, and transactional diplomacy.Why It Matters: This marks the second time Trump has broken bipartisan tradition by snubbing U.S. neighbors in favor of Gulf autocracies. His visit prioritizes personal business interests and transactional diplomacy. With Trump Organization deals in the region and alliances frayed, he\u2019s once again choosing authoritarians over long-standing democratic partners.Source: NBC News\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchOnce-Fringe Activists Are Fighting to Be the Voice of the Anti-Abortion MovementWhat Happened: Radical anti-abortion activists like Jason Storms of Operation Save America\u2014once dismissed as fringe\u2014are gaining influence in GOP circles, pushing extreme \u201cabortion abolition\u201d policies that seek to classify abortion as homicide and prosecute women for murder. These activists are lobbying lawmakers to enshrine personhood at conception and criminalize self-managed abortion.Why It Matters: These extremist efforts could reshape abortion policy nationwide\u2014criminalizing pregnant women, restricting IVF, and expanding state control over reproductive decisions. Once dismissed as fringe, the movement is embraced by GOP leaders, highlighting the growing grip of religious nationalism on Republican politics.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsHow Trump's tariffs are causing pain for some U.S. manufacturersWhat Happened: U.S. manufacturers like JLS and Horst Engineering report that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs\u2014especially the 10% minimum tariff on most imports and 145% on Chinese goods\u2014are driving up costs for materials and equipment, cutting into profits and stalling expansion plans.Why It Matters: While Trump claims tariffs will boost U.S. manufacturing, many businesses say they\u2019re facing falling demand, rising input costs, and uncertainty. Some are considering moving operations overseas or delaying investments.Source: NBC NewsPort of LA Cargo Down 35% Amid TariffsWhat Happened: Cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles has plunged 35% from the same week last year, after Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and ended the $800 exemption for low-cost imports. The sharp decline is cutting work hours for dockworkers and squeezing local businesses dependent on port traffic.Why It Matters: As one of America\u2019s key trade hubs, the Port of LA moves goods that reach all 50 states. This slowdown threatens a nationwide ripple effect\u2014supply chain disruptions, rising prices, and job losses across industries dependent on imports. Workers, port-dependent vendors, and shipping firms are already feeling the economic pain.Source: NPRE.U. Unveils a Plan to Hit Back at the U.S. if Trade Negotiations FailWhat Happened: The European Union warned it may slap retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion in U.S. goods\u2014including meat, soybeans, bourbon, and aircraft parts\u2014if trade talks with the U.S. fail. The tariffs would hit major companies like Boeing and American agribusinesses.Why It Matters: As Trump ramps up his tariff war, Europe is preparing to hit back hard. Despite Trump\u2019s upbeat rhetoric, Brussels is bracing for failed talks and weighing retaliation beyond goods, targeting U.S. tech and cloud services, core pillars of the American economy.

Attempting with brute strength, evasion of laws, breaking laws, intimidation, and legal chicanery, to change a country against its will.  All the while rebelling in unparalleled corruption  They will fail. The project is too large for them but at what huge cost in damaged lives, be-smeared reputations, broken institutions, lost alliances, closed stores, and a smashed economy?  They have done so little good and so much harm.  This is the worst administration in U.S. history and mind-bogglingly corrupt.</span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full
