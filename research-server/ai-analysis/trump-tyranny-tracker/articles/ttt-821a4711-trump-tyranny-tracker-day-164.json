These projects, backed by foreign investors and tied to his political brand, now make up a growing share of his $6.4B fortune.Why It Matters: Trump continues monetizing the presidency through influence-driven crypto deals. It\u2019s a new era of kleptocracy\u2014where political power fuels fast digital profits with no oversight.Source: BloombergTrump\u2019s Finances Were Shaky. Then He Began to Capitalize on His Comeback.What Happened: Facing plummeting cash reserves, underperforming properties, and mounting legal judgments, Trump quietly scrambled to save his empire in 2023. After securing the GOP nomination, he pivoted to influence-based deals\u2014especially in crypto and licensing\u2014shifting away from real estate toward monetizing his name and office.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s corrupt presidency is deeply entangled with his personal financial survival.

Weighs Seeking Criminal Charges as It Presses States for Election DataWhat Happened: The Justice Department is weighing criminal charges against state and local election officials it deems negligent in securing voting systems, despite no evidence of wrongdoing. Prosecutors have already begun pressuring states like Wisconsin and Colorado for detailed election data, citing a March executive order to review systems and block noncitizen access.Why It Matters: This is a blatant power grab. Trump\u2019s DOJ is using threats and fake conspiracy theories to criminalize election workers and try to rig the system in his favor. It\u2019s a purge of anyone who won\u2019t help him steal the next election.Source: New York Times\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump sued for giving Medicaid data to deportation officialsWhat Happened: 20 states are suing Trump for violating federal privacy laws by releasing Medicaid data on millions of non-citizen enrollees to DHS. The move, pushed by HHS and tied to immigration enforcement, has sparked fears it will deter people from seeking emergency medical care.Why It Matters: By weaponizing health data, the regime is creating a climate of fear that threatens public health, violates HIPAA, and sets a dangerous precedent for government misuse of confidential information that will expand to all Americans.Source: The GuardianPentagon Again Expanding Military Border Zones, This Time in ArizonaWhat Happened: The Pentagon is transferring 140 more miles of federal land in Arizona to military control, expanding Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s plan that now places over 600 miles of the southern border under Department of Defense oversight, with military zones also tied to Fort Bliss, Fort Huachuca, and Joint Base San Antonio.Why It Matters: This is a continued dangerous shift toward military rule. Trump is replacing civilian immigration enforcement with soldiers and bases, turning the U.S.-Mexico line into a militarized zone. It erodes constitutional norms and sets the stage for further domestic use of the military against civilians.Source: Military.comKristi Noem Looks to Fire Homeland Security Workers \u2018Who Don\u2019t Like Us\u2019What Happened: Kristi Noem said she\u2019s seeking ways to fire DHS employees who \u201cdon\u2019t support what we\u2019re doing,\u201d criticizing the workforce as lazy under past leadership. She\u2019s using polygraphs to root out dissent and has slashed departments like FEMA, CISA, and Civil Rights.Why It Matters: Purging career officials for ideology is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. Trump\u2019s allies\u2014Giuliani, Lewandowski, and others\u2014are reshaping DHS into a loyalist weapon, gutting its independence and turning it into an enforcement arm of Trump\u2019s political agenda.Source: BloombergSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsParamount Settles with Trump for $16M Over 60 Minutes InterviewWhat Happened: Paramount has agreed to pay $16 million to a cause of Trump\u2019s choosing\u2014either his future library or a charity\u2014to settle his lawsuit over \u201cdeceptive editing\u201d of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. The company made no apology but reached the deal as it seeks FCC approval for an $8.4 billion merger.Why It Matters: This was a sham lawsuit, and yet another major media company just caved to Trump under legal and political pressure. Experts warn the massive payout could violate bribery laws\u2014especially with Trump loyalists controlling key regulatory approvals. It\u2019s a chilling sign of how media organizations are bending to authoritarian threats as Trump escalates his attacks on the free press.Source: The GuardianDemocratic FCC Commissioner Blasts Paramount Settlement with Trump as 'Desperate Move'What Happened: FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez condemned Paramount\u2019s $16 million settlement with Trump over a 60 Minutes interview featuring Kamala Harris, calling it a \"desperate move\" to secure approval for its $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. Gomez warned that the deal sets a dangerous precedent for press freedom and urged the full commission to vote on the merger rather than allowing quiet approval.Why It Matters: Paramount\u2019s payout to Trump to secure a merger approval sets a dangerous precedent for press freedom. It sends a clear message: caving to an authoritarian leader\u2019s demands is the new price of staying in business, even if it means sacrificing journalistic integrity.Source: ReutersTrump\u2019s Lawfare Against the Free PressWhat Happened: Trump threatened to prosecute CNN over its coverage of the ICEBlock app and a leaked intel report on Iran, while Kristi Noem backed the move. Meanwhile, CBS parent Paramount paid Trump $16 million to settle a baseless lawsuit.Why It Matters: Trump is weaponizing the law to punish the press. This is a textbook authoritarian tactic\u2014using legal threats, investigations, and financial pressure to control public information, intimidate journalists, and silence independent media.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump suggests he could demand journalists reveal source of Iran intel leakWhat Happened: Trump said journalists may be forced to reveal sources behind leaked intel showing U.S. strikes on Iran only delayed, not obliterated, its nuclear program. He blamed Democrats and vowed prosecutions, calling for reporters to disclose leaks tied to national security.Why It Matters: It\u2019s a direct threat to press freedom. Trump is using national security as a pretext to punish accurate reporting and intimidate journalists.Source: Washington PostTrump\u2019s \u2018Alligator Alcatraz\u2019 tour was a calculated celebration of the dystopianWhat Happened: Trump toured his new ICE detention center in Florida, \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d alongside Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis. The facility, seized from Miami-Dade County and surrounded by marshland full of alligators and pythons, will hold 5,000 migrants in extreme heat. Why It Matters: This was a state-sponsored theater of cruelty. Trump used the spectacle to glorify mass detention, internment camps and to further dehumanize migrants. It was a gross show of force\u2014and a preview of the dystopian policies he plans to expand.Source: The GuardianStaunch Election Denier Appointed to Georgia County\u2019s Elections BoardWhat Happened: Gail Lee, a known election denier who has challenged hundreds of voter registrations since 2020, was appointed to DeKalb County\u2019s Board of Registration and Elections. Her nomination by the local GOP follows failed efforts to appoint another extremist, William Henderson, who was rejected by a judge due to a conflict of interest and public backlash.Why It Matters: Placing a 2020 election denier in a key election oversight role in a Democratic stronghold like DeKalb County is a clear threat to voting rights and election integrity. It signals the GOP\u2019s ongoing effort to undermine trust in elections from within.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS Tells Court It Can\u2019t Locate Man Wrongly Sent to El SalvadorWhat Happened: Trump officials told a federal appeals court it couldn\u2019t locate Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron, wrongfully disappeared to El Salvador, despite a court order to bring him back. The DOJ said diplomatic efforts are underway, but did not commit to returning him.Why It Matters: This is more lawless behavior. Trump officials continue ignoring court orders after disappearing people without due process. Legal rights are meaningless when power goes unchecked.Source: BloombergICEBlock App Lets Users Report ICE Sightings Amid CrackdownWhat Happened: ICEBlock, a new iOS app, allows users to anonymously report ICE activity within five miles of their location. Launched in April, the app now has 20,000 users, mainly in Los Angeles, and was created in response to Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.Source: The HillU.S. citizen seeks $1 million after arrest, detention for recording immigration raidWhat Happened: Job Garcia, a U.S. citizen and Ph.D. student, was arrested and detained for over 24 hours after filming an immigration raid at a Los Angeles Home Depot. MALDEF is suing ICE, CBP, and DHS for $1 million, alleging Garcia was tackled, restrained, and arrested without cause for advising a truck driver of his rights.Why It Matters: The lawsuit highlights growing concerns over free speech, racial profiling, and civil rights. DHS claims Garcia \u201cassaulted\u201d an agent, but civil rights lawyers argue his arrest was unlawful and meant to silence dissent.Source: The Hill\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchTrump Freezes $6 Billion for After-School and Summer ProgramsWhat Happened: Trump is withholding over $6 billion in federal education grants, including funding for after-school care, summer camps, English learner programs, and adult literacy. The freeze, part of a review to align with Trump\u2019s agenda, has left states scrambling as the money was expected on July 1. No timeline has been given for disbursement.Why It Matters: This funding freeze targets vulnerable children, guts support for working families, and undermines programs Congress already approved. Shutting down Head Start centers and child care services in migrant and rural areas is another calculated attack on the poor to advance an extremist agenda.Source: Associated PressInsurers Aren\u2019t Saying Whether They\u2019ll Cover Vaccines for Kids if Government Stops Recommending ThemWhat Happened: After RFK Jr. replaced the CDC\u2019s vaccine board with anti-vaccine allies, the new panel may drop some childhood vaccines from the recommended schedule. Only one major insurer has pledged continued coverage; most are staying quiet.Why It Matters: If ACIP removes vaccines and insurers follow, millions of children could lose access to free, life-saving immunizations\u2014risking public health and fueling preventable outbreaks.Source: WIREDTrump\u2019s First EPA Promised to Crack Down on Forever Chemicals. His Second EPA Is Pulling Back.What Happened: EPA is delaying enforcement of drinking water limits on PFAS chemicals until 2031, reversing earlier progress made under both his first term and Biden\u2019s. The agency also canceled $15 million in PFAS research funding, slowed pollution tracking efforts, and requested court delays on holding polluters accountable under Superfund.Why It Matters: PFAS are toxic, cancer-linked chemicals that contaminate water across the U.S. While Trump officials claim to be \u201cfollowing the science,\u201d they\u2019re dismantling the very standards and research needed to protect public health, leaving communities exposed to long-term harm.Source: ProPublica\u2018We\u2019ve been ghosted by FEMA\u2019: Officials across country say they can\u2019t get answers on critical fundingWhat Happened: FEMA officials say they\u2019re being blocked from communicating with Congress and local agencies. Internal memos reveal that all inquiries must go through political appointees as Kristi Noem tightens control, and Trump plans to shut down FEMA after hurricane season.Why It Matters: Trump officials are gutting disaster response in real-time. As storms intensify, critical funding is delayed and experienced staff are muzzled\u2014leaving millions vulnerable.Source: CNNRepublican budget bill dismantles climate law passed by DemocratsWhat Happened: Senate Republicans passed their bill that dismantles key parts of the 2022 climate law, ending most wind and solar tax credits and eliminating EV subsidies. While a proposed tax on renewable energy was dropped, the bill accelerates the rollback of clean energy incentives. It also expands oil, gas, and coal leasing and blocks methane emissions penalties. Why It Matters: This bill hands billions to Big Oil, guts support for renewables, and blocks progress on America\u2019s clean energy future. As wildfires rage and temperatures soar, Trump is dooming the country to a dirtier, deadlier, and more expensive energy system that benefits polluters while we all pay the price.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchIran\u2019s president orders country to suspend cooperation with UN nuclear watchdog IAEAWhat Happened: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered an immediate halt to cooperation with the IAEA after U.S. and Israeli airstrikes struck key nuclear sites, including Fordow. The move, based on a parliamentary law, heightens fears over Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, as international inspectors remain in the dark about the fate of the missing highly enriched uranium.Why It Matters: With inspectors shut out and monitoring suspended, Iran is now free to escalate its program without transparency, risking a new crisis in the Middle East and undermining years of nonproliferation efforts.Source: Associated Press\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump allies caught off guard by Pentagon\u2019s Ukraine weapons freezeWhy It Matters: This wasn\u2019t a routine review\u2014it was an excuse to aid Russia\u2019s genocidal war, just as Moscow unleashes its most intense and brutal attacks since the full-scale invasion began. The freeze is a betrayal of Ukraine, a gift to Putin, and a warning to allies.Source: PoliticoLack of New U.S. Sanctions Allows Restricted Goods and Funds Into RussiaWhat Happened: Trump has issued no new sanctions on Russia in 2025 and has quietly eased some, including lifting restrictions on Karina Rotenberg. This pause has allowed shell companies in China and Hong Kong to funnel military components to Russia, bypassing U.S. controls. Meanwhile, the DOJ\u2019s KleptoCapture task force was disbanded as one of Trump\u2019s first actions.Why It Matters: With no new enforcement, Russia is freely rebuilding its wartime supply chains. Trump\u2019s loyalty to Moscow is gutting Western pressure and reiterating that the U.S. will aid in Russia\u2019s continued aggression, occupation, and genocide in Ukraine.Source: New York TimesNorth Korea to Send 30,000 Troops to Fight for Russia in UkraineWhat Happened: North Korea plans to deploy up to 30,000 troops to support Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence. This follows a prior secret deployment of 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late 2024, which Moscow later confirmed. Satellite imagery, flight data, and military logistics indicate preparations are underway, with Russian forces integrating North Korean units into active combat roles and front-line operations.Why It Matters: Ukraine is battling Russia and a coalition of authoritarian regimes\u2014North Korean troops/weapons, Iranian and Chinese weapons\u2014while the U.S. abandons its ally. By freezing key arms shipments, Trump continues providing cover for Russia\u2019s genocidal war and signals to other dictators that America no longer stands by its commitments.Source: CNNUkraine Fears Increased Russian Aggression After U.S. Halts Weapons ShipmentsWhat Happened: Trump officials abruptly paused key weapons deliveries to Ukraine, citing \u201cconcerns\u201d over U.S. stockpiles. Kyiv warned the move will embolden Russia to prolong its genocidal war, which just saw one of its largest aerial attacks in June\u2014over 5,400 drones and hundreds of missiles. The suspension includes Patriot interceptors, Howitzer shells, and other vital munitions already staged in Poland and approved by Congress during the Biden administration.Why It Matters: This guts Ukraine\u2019s defenses as Russia escalates against all Ukrainian cities and mirrors Trump\u2019s 2019 illegal aid freeze, which led to his impeachment. Trump and Republicans continue aiding Russia\u2019s genocidal war by starving Ukraine of weaponsSource: BBC News and Associated PressTrans Pilot Falsely Blamed for DC Crash Sues Right-Wing InfluencerWhat Happened: Jo Ellis, a Virginia National Guard pilot, was falsely accused online of causing a deadly Blackhawk airliner crash in DC that killed 67. The conspiracy, fueled by Trump allies like Matt Wallace and QAnon figures, spread rapidly after Trump\u2019s military transgender ban. Ellis, who wasn't involved in the crash, has filed a defamation lawsuit and released a \u201cproof of life\u201d video to stop the harassment.Why It Matters: This is part of a dangerous trend of weaponizing disinformation to scapegoat trans-Americans and others Trump targets. Right-wing influencers are turning entire communities into national punching bags\u2014fueling harassment, violence, and policy rollbacks that strip away rights and dignity.Source: WIRED\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump says U.S. struck trade deal with Vietnam that imposes 20% tariff on its importsWhat Happened: Trump announced a trade agreement with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on transshipped products, mainly aimed at cracking down on Chinese rerouting. In exchange, the U.S. will reportedly gain full tariff-free access to Vietnam\u2019s markets. Why It Matters: The deal hikes import costs for U.S. businesses and will drive up prices for consumers, despite Trump's claim that Vietnam will \u201cpay\u201d the tariffs. Critics warn the move destabilizes trade and injects more economic uncertainty, while Trump frames it as a win for U.S. manufacturers and revenue.Source: CNBCUS private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, missing expectations for an increase of 115,000What Happened: In a surprising turn, the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, the first monthly decline in over two years, missing forecasts of a 115,000 gain. Hiring stalled across industries, with companies reluctant to fill vacancies amid uncertainty driven by Trump\u2019s tariffs, federal cuts, and immigration crackdowns.Why It Matters: The job loss signals growing economic fragility. While layoffs remain low, businesses are freezing hiring, reflecting deep unease over policy-driven volatility. The labor market may be softening\u2014slowly, then all at once.Source: CNNMicrosoft laying off about 9,000 employees in latest round of cutsWhat Happened: Microsoft is cutting about 9,000 jobs across departments and regions. The layoffs follow previous rounds in May and June and are part of a broader effort to streamline management and increase agility.Why It Matters: Despite massive profits and record stock performance, Microsoft continues to shrink its workforce amid shifting business priorities and internal restructuring. The move reflects ongoing tech industry volatility.Source: CNBC\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News7/17- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Mayors Sue Over Trump\u2019s Efforts to Restrict Obamacare SignupsWhat Happened: The mayors of Baltimore, Chicago, and Columbus are suing Trump over new rules that shorten Obamacare enrollment, tighten income checks, and allow insurers to deny coverage for unpaid premiums. The rules are expected to strip coverage from up to 2 million people and bar certain immigrants from enrolling.Source: The GuardianL.A. Legal Groups Sue to Stop \u2018Unconstitutional\u2019 Immigration ActionsWhat Happened: Civil rights groups in Los Angeles filed a federal lawsuit accusing Trump of racial profiling, warrantless arrests, and detaining immigrants in \u201cdungeonlike\u201d conditions as part of aggressive new ICE and Border Patrol raids. The suit describes indiscriminate sweeps targeting Latino workers at bus stops, swap meets, and job sites, often carried out by masked agents in unmarked cars.Source: New York TimesJudge blocks order barring asylum access at border and gives Trump officials two weeks to appealWhat Happened: A federal judge ruled that Trump\u2019s executive order suspending asylum access at the southern border is unlawful, stating the president cannot override laws passed by Congress. The judge stayed the ruling until July 16 to give the Trump officials time to appeal. The order, issued in January, cited an \u201cinvasion\u201d and suspended asylum rights indefinitely.Source: Associated Press\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers7/17 \u2014 Next nationwide National Day of Action$620 million \u2014 Trump\u2019s earnings from crypto ventures like World Liberty Financial and a Trump-themed memecoin in just months,$6.4 billion \u2014 Trump\u2019s estimated total fortune, now heavily reliant on influence-based crypto deals$16 million \u2014 Paramount\u2019s payout to Trump in a merger-linked settlement over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, raising legal and press freedom concerns.30,000 \u2014 North Korean troops being deployed to fight for Russia in Ukraine, in addition to 11,000 sent earlier.5,400 \u2014 Number of drones used by Russia in one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine in June.$6 billion \u2014 Federal education funds frozen by Trump, affecting after-school and summer programs.33,000 \u2014 Private-sector jobs lost in June\u2014the first monthly decline in over two years.9,000 \u2014 Microsoft jobs cut in the latest wave of layoffs amid tech sector volatility.$15 million \u2014 Slashed funding for PFAS chemical research by Trump\u2019s EPA, delaying pollution safeguards until 2031.20% tariff \u2014 New tax on Vietnamese imports under Trump\u2019s trade deal, raising costs for U.S. consumers.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump is laying the groundwork to go after Social Security and Medicare \u2014 How soon before seniors and disabled Americans feel the full impact?DOJ is threatening election workers with criminal charges \u2014 Will anyone stop this  threat to state officials and election workers before the 2026 elections?Trump\u2019s purge of civil servants is accelerating \u2014 Can the courts stop him from turning federal agencies into loyalty-based enforcement arms?Trump is punishing children and families by freezing education grants \u2014 Will public outrage force Congress to intervene before school programs shut down?FCC is being used to silence media and reward allies \u2014 How many more outlets will cave to stay in business?\ud83d\udca1 Key TakeawaysTrump\u2019s Economic Warfare \u2014 His erratic tariff policies are pushing the U.S. into a recession or worse and destabilizing global markets.

Trump is replacing civilian immigration enforcement with soldiers and bases, turning the U.S.-Mexico line into a militarized zone.

The company made no apology but reached the deal as it seeks FCC approval for an $8.4 billion merger.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This was a sham lawsuit, and yet another major media company just caved to Trump under legal and political pressure. Experts warn the massive payout could violate bribery laws\\u2014especially with Trump loyalists controlling key regulatory approvals. It\\u2019s a chilling sign of how media organizations are bending to authoritarian threats as Trump escalates his attacks on the free press.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Democratic FCC Commissioner Blasts Paramount Settlement with Trump as 'Desperate Move'</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez condemned Paramount\\u2019s $16 million settlement with Trump over a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview featuring Kamala Harris, calling it a \\\\\\\"desperate move\\\\\\\" to secure approval for its $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. Gomez warned that the deal sets a dangerous precedent for press freedom and urged the full commission to vote on the merger rather than allowing quiet approval.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Paramount\\u2019s payout to Trump to secure a merger approval sets a dangerous precedent for press freedom.

He blamed Democrats and vowed prosecutions, calling for reporters to disclose leaks tied to national security.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> It\\u2019s a direct threat to press freedom.

The facility, seized from Miami-Dade County and surrounded by marshland full of alligators and pythons, will hold 5,000 migrants in extreme heat. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This was a state-sponsored theater of cruelty. Trump used the spectacle to glorify mass detention, internment camps and to further dehumanize migrants.

Her nomination by the local GOP follows failed efforts to appoint another extremist, William Henderson, who was rejected by a judge due to a conflict of interest and public backlash.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Placing a 2020 election denier in a key election oversight role in a Democratic stronghold like DeKalb County is a clear threat to voting rights and election integrity. It signals the GOP\\u2019s ongoing effort to undermine trust in elections from within.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/georgia-election-denier-gail-lee\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>US Tells Court It Can\\u2019t Locate Man Wrongly Sent to El Salvador</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump officials told a federal appeals court it couldn\\u2019t locate Jordin Alexander Melgar-Salmeron, wrongfully disappeared to El Salvador, despite a court order to bring him back. The DOJ said diplomatic efforts are underway, but did not commit to returning him.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is more lawless behavior. Trump officials continue ignoring court orders after disappearing people without due process.

MALDEF is suing ICE, CBP, and DHS for $1 million, alleging Garcia was tackled, restrained, and arrested without cause for advising a truck driver of his rights.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The lawsuit highlights growing concerns over free speech, racial profiling, and civil rights. DHS claims Garcia \\u201Cassaulted\\u201D an agent, but civil rights lawyers argue his arrest was unlawful and meant to silence dissent.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5382868-u-s-citizen-seeks-1-million-after-arrest-detention-for-recording-immigration-raid/\\\\\\\">The Hill</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCC9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump Freezes $6 Billion for After-School and Summer Programs</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump is withholding over $6 billion in federal education grants, including funding for after-school care, summer camps, English learner programs, and adult literacy. The freeze, part of a review to align with Trump\\u2019s agenda, has left states scrambling as the money was expected on July 1. No timeline has been given for disbursement.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This funding freeze targets vulnerable children, guts support for working families, and undermines programs Congress already approved. Shutting down Head Start centers and child care services in migrant and rural areas is another calculated attack on the poor to advance an extremist agenda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-summer-school-english-language-grants-fac670e8f60fab397fbd68dfed866ea1\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Insurers Aren\\u2019t Saying Whether They\\u2019ll Cover Vaccines for Kids if Government Stops Recommending Them</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> After RFK Jr. replaced the CDC\\u2019s vaccine board with anti-vaccine allies, the new panel may drop some childhood vaccines from the recommended schedule. Only one major insurer has pledged continued coverage; most are staying quiet.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> If ACIP removes vaccines and insurers follow, millions of children could lose access to free, life-saving immunizations\\u2014risking public health and fueling preventable outbreaks.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/\\\\\\\">WIRED</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump\\u2019s First EPA Promised to Crack Down on Forever Chemicals. His Second EPA Is Pulling Back.</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> EPA is delaying enforcement of drinking water limits on PFAS chemicals until 2031, reversing earlier progress made under both his first term and Biden\\u2019s. The agency also canceled $15 million in PFAS research funding, slowed pollution tracking efforts, and requested court delays on holding polluters accountable under Superfund.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> PFAS are toxic, cancer-linked chemicals that contaminate water across the U.S. While Trump officials claim to be \\u201Cfollowing the science,\\u201D they\\u2019re dismantling the very standards and research needed to protect public health, leaving communities exposed to long-term harm.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-pfas-drinking-water\\\\\\\">ProPublica</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>\\u2018We\\u2019ve been ghosted by FEMA\\u2019: Officials across country say they can\\u2019t get answers on critical funding</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> FEMA officials say they\\u2019re being blocked from communicating with Congress and local agencies. Internal memos reveal that all inquiries must go through political appointees as Kristi Noem tightens control, and Trump plans to shut down FEMA after hurricane season.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump officials are gutting disaster response in real-time.

While a proposed tax on renewable energy was dropped, the bill accelerates the rollback of clean energy incentives. It also expands oil, gas, and coal leasing and blocks methane emissions penalties. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This bill hands billions to Big Oil, guts support for renewables, and blocks progress on America\\u2019s clean energy future. As wildfires rage and temperatures soar, Trump is dooming the country to a dirtier, deadlier, and more expensive energy system that benefits polluters while we all pay the price.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/senate-republican-tax-credits-wind-solar-trump-ceb3bd36c25017e29fccdcc4c749391f\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF10 Imperial and Geopolitical Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Iran\\u2019s president orders country to suspend cooperation with UN nuclear watchdog IAEA</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered an immediate halt to cooperation with the IAEA after U.S. and Israeli airstrikes struck key nuclear sites, including Fordow. The move, based on a parliamentary law, heightens fears over Iran\\u2019s nuclear ambitions, as international inspectors remain in the dark about the fate of the missing highly enriched uranium.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With inspectors shut out and monitoring suspended, Iran is now free to escalate its program without transparency, risking a new crisis in the Middle East and undermining years of nonproliferation efforts.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-cooperation-8bbdc81b9199d8d179d0fb2e1b8dac2a\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83C\\uDF0D Far-Right &amp; Russian Influence Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Trump allies caught off guard by Pentagon\\u2019s Ukraine weapons freeze</h3><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This wasn\\u2019t a routine review\\u2014it was an excuse to aid Russia\\u2019s genocidal war, just as Moscow unleashes its most intense and brutal attacks since the full-scale invasion began.

This pause has allowed shell companies in China and Hong Kong to funnel military components to Russia, bypassing U.S. controls. Meanwhile, the DOJ\\u2019s KleptoCapture task force was disbanded as one of Trump\\u2019s first actions.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> With no new enforcement, Russia is freely rebuilding its wartime supply chains. Trump\\u2019s loyalty to Moscow is gutting Western pressure and reiterating that the U.S. will aid in Russia\\u2019s continued aggression, occupation, and genocide in Ukraine.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>North Korea to Send 30,000 Troops to Fight for Russia in Ukraine</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> North Korea plans to deploy up to 30,000 troops to support Russia\\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence. This follows a prior secret deployment of 11,000 North Korean soldiers in late 2024, which Moscow later confirmed. Satellite imagery, flight data, and military logistics indicate preparations are underway, with Russian forces integrating North Korean units into active combat roles and front-line operations.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Ukraine is battling Russia and a coalition of authoritarian regimes\\u2014North Korean troops/weapons, Iranian and Chinese weapons\\u2014while the U.S. abandons its ally.

Kyiv warned the move will embolden Russia to prolong its genocidal war, which just saw one of its largest aerial attacks in June\\u2014over 5,400 drones and hundreds of missiles. The suspension includes Patriot interceptors, Howitzer shells, and other vital munitions already staged in Poland and approved by Congress during the Biden administration.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This guts Ukraine\\u2019s defenses as Russia escalates against all Ukrainian cities and mirrors Trump\\u2019s 2019 illegal aid freeze, which led to his impeachment.

The conspiracy, fueled by Trump allies like Matt Wallace and QAnon figures, spread rapidly after Trump\\u2019s military transgender ban. Ellis, who wasn't involved in the crash, has filed a defamation lawsuit and released a \\u201Cproof of life\\u201D video to stop the harassment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is part of a dangerous trend of weaponizing disinformation to scapegoat trans-Americans and others Trump targets.

In exchange, the U.S. will reportedly gain full tariff-free access to Vietnam\\u2019s markets. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The deal hikes import costs for U.S. businesses and will drive up prices for consumers, despite Trump's claim that Vietnam will \\u201Cpay\\u201D the tariffs. Critics warn the move destabilizes trade and injects more economic uncertainty, while Trump frames it as a win for U.S. manufacturers and revenue.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/trump-trade-vietnam-deal.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>US private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, missing expectations for an increase of 115,000</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a surprising turn, the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, the first monthly decline in over two years, missing forecasts of a 115,000 gain.
