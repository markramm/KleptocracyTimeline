Defense firms like Lockheed Martin and Palantir expect new contracts, while SpaceX and Starlink expand their grip on NASA and national security. Musk continues to expand his control over federal spending and the government.Why It Matters: With Trump removing watchdogs, he and Musk face no oversight, accelerating government privatization and funneling billions to regime-aligned cronies\u2014mirroring Russia\u2019s oligarch-controlled economy.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsMusk Seeks IRS Access to Taxpayer Data, Raising AlarmWhat Happened: Elon Musk is seeking access to IRS taxpayer databases, including the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), which contains sensitive financial data on millions of Americans. The White House is pressuring the IRS to grant FAKE DOGE operative Gavin Kliger access under the guise of IT modernization and fraud detection. Why It Matters: Granting political appointees access to taxpayer data is unprecedented and dangerous and will lead to potential political targeting, leaks, and abuse. IRS officials fear the move jeopardizes the agency\u2019s independence, especially as Trump previously floated using the IRS against political opponents. Source: The Washington PostTrump DOJ Moves to Control InvestigationsWhat Happened: Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s DOJ is dropping cases against Trump allies, including NYC Mayor Eric Adams, prompting mass resignations. The department also demanded FBI agent lists from the Capitol riot probe and sued a state attorney general who won a fraud case against Trump. A new \"Weaponization Working Group\" targets prosecutors who pursued Trump.Why It Matters: The DOJ is being reshaped to protect Trump and punish opponents, undermining prosecutorial independence and shifting law enforcement toward political control.Source: Associated PressThousands of Federal Health Workers Fired Amid DOGE-Led PurgeWhat Happened: Thousands of probationary workers across federal health agencies were fired via letter on Saturday. The CDC, FDA, NIH, and Medicare services were among the affected agencies. Why It Matters: The cuts weaken public health preparedness, affecting agencies managing pandemic stockpiles, disease detection, and medical regulation. The FDA\u2019s oversight of tobacco and medical devices was hit, despite being funded by industry fees\u2014not taxpayers. This is a politically driven purge that will cripple health and safety programs.Source: CBS NewsTrump Fires 400+ DHS Employees Amid Mass LayoffsWhat Happened: Trump fired over 400 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees, targeting FEMA, CISA, and USCIS as part of a government-wide purge. Probationary workers received identical termination letters, and high-performing recruits were among those let go. Cuts also included Coast Guard DEI staff, reassigned to border duty.Why It Matters: This sweeping purge weakens disaster relief, cybersecurity, and immigration services, while leaving ICE and CBP untouched. The firings continue to prioritize Trump\u2019s extremist agenda over national security, with CISA\u2019s election security role particularly at risk.Source: CBS NewsTrump Fires Hundreds of FAA Workers Amid Aviation Safety CrisisWhat Happened: Trump fired hundreds of probationary FAA employees responsible for maintaining air traffic control infrastructure, according to their union. The cuts come weeks after a deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., and ongoing FAA system failures.Why It Matters: The firings exacerbate aviation safety risks, especially amid ongoing air traffic controller shortages and recent deadly crashes\u2014compromising public safety.Source: CNN\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Appeals to Supreme Court, Claims \"Unprecedented Assault\" on Presidential PowerWhat Happened: Trump is asking the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that temporarily reinstated Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers. Dellinger was fired without cause as part of Trump's federal workforce purge. The Justice Department argues the ruling improperly restricts presidential authority.Why It Matters: This case is a major test of executive power. A Supreme Court win for Trump would set a precedent for purging watchdog agencies and silencing whistleblowers\u2014handing him Putin-like control over government oversight.Source: Associated PressDOE Threatens Schools Over \u2018Discriminatory\u2019 DEI PoliciesWhat Happened: The Department of Education issued a four-page memo warning all schools to DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor declared race-based decision-making \"impermissible\" and gave schools 14 days to comply.Why It Matters: The memo is part of the Trump regime\u2019s broader effort to dismantle DEI initiatives, following executive orders targeting race-conscious policies in federal agencies, education, and corporate governance. This move mirrors authoritarian tactics to suppress marginalized communities and erode civil rights protections.Source: PoliticoTrump Fires \u2018Exceptional\u2019 DOT Workers, Citing \u2018Performance\u2019 IssuesWhat Happened: Trump fired dozens of Department of Transportation employees, citing poor performance, despite supervisors rating them as \u2018exceptional.\u2019 Why It Matters: These rapid and disorganized layoffs raise concerns about politicized firings and a lack of due process, especially as some terminations are already being reversed due to errors. The broader 10% federal workforce reduction will disrupt critical government functions.Source: NBC NewsTrump DOJ Fires Immigration Judges Amid BacklogWhat Happened: The Justice Department fired multiple immigration judges, including Biden-era appointees, in a sweeping personnel purge. At least five assistant chief judges and 13 judicial candidates were dismissed.Why It Matters: The move worsens an already record-high immigration case backlog, contradicting Trump\u2019s mass deportation plans, which need more judges to process removals. The politically motivated firings will cripple the immigration court system just as Trump escalates enforcement\u2014reinforcing that his regime has no intention of offering undocumented immigrants their due process.Source: NBC NewsOcasio-Cortez on Homan suggesting she\u2019s \u2018gonna be in trouble\u2019What Happened: Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d suggested Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) could be in legal trouble for educating migrants on their rights. Homan, appearing on Fox News, questioned whether her efforts impeded law enforcement and said he was working with the DOJ to determine if she had \u201ccrossed the line.\u201dWhy It Matters: This is an authoritarian weaponization of federal agencies against opposition. The regime is prepared to weaponize the DOJ for political retaliation\u2014targeting critics.Source: The HillTrump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assaultWhat Happened: Trump is dismantling labor protections, firing thousands of federal workers, and crippling agencies like the NLRB and EEOC that enforce union rights and workplace discrimination laws. Trump is firing key labor officials, nullifying federal union contracts, and disbanding DEI programs. Meanwhile, Musk and Bezos are backing efforts to shut down the NLRB entirely, leaving workers with little recourse against corporate power.Why It Matters: Trump and Musk are weaponizing the government to crush labor rights, while anti-union billionaires like Musk and Bezos push to dismantle the NLRB entirely. With no enforcement, workers lose their ability to organize, fight unfair firings, and challenge discrimination\u2014marking a shift toward authoritarian governance.Source: The GuardianSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsTrump\u2019s Post Sparks Fears of Authoritarian RuleWhat Happened: Trump posted, \u201cHe who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\u201d sparking accusations of authoritarianism. The White House reshared it with his mugshot. This further shows Trump is positioning himself above the law. Why It Matters: The post highlights that Trump is laying the groundwork for authoritarian rule, justifying rule-breaking as necessary for \"saving the country,\" as his regime moves to consolidate power, purge government workers, and weaken legal oversight. And my millionth reminder\u2014 dictators write their own set of laws.Source: ABC NewsN.Y. Governor Rejects Louisiana\u2019s Extradition Request for Abortion DoctorWhat Happened: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Dr. Margaret Daley Carpenter, a New York physician indicted for prescribing abortion pills via telehealth in Louisiana. Texas also fined Carpenter $100,000 for prescribing abortion medication across state lines, citing an alleged violation of state law for practicing without a local license.Why It Matters: Republican-led states are becoming increasingly emboldened, using indictments and extradition requests to target doctors providing abortion care across state lines. This legal battle could set a dangerous precedent, undermining shield laws meant to protect providers and expanding the reach of restrictive state abortion bans beyond their borders.Source: NBC NewsBill Introduced to Make Trump\u2019s Birthday a Federal HolidayWhat Happened: Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) introduced legislation to make June 14\u2014President Donald Trump\u2019s birthday and Flag Day\u2014a federal holiday. The \u201cTrump\u2019s Birthday and Flag Day Holiday Establishment Act\u201d seeks to honor Trump\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d alongside the annual observance of Flag Day.Why It Matters: The bill, absurdly comparing Trump to George Washington, is part of a broader effort to enshrine his \u201clegacy\u201d into U.S. law. This is a classic authoritarian tactic to cement his influence\u2014will the government demand the placement of Trump gold statues in every town and city next?Source: Press ReleaseWashington Post backs out of \u2018Fire Elon Musk\u2019 ad orderWhat Happened: The Washington Post backed out of a $115,000 advertising deal with advocacy group Common Cause, which planned to run a \"Fire Elon Musk\" ad campaign. The ad criticized Musk\u2019s unchecked influence in the Trump regime and was set to appear as a wraparound on the paper's front and back pages, targeting Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House.Why It Matters: The decision raises concerns about media independence and highlights the Post currying favor with the Trump regime. This also reflects an authoritarian shift in which media outlets are pressured to avoid content critical of Trump and Musk.Source: The HillAxios Adopts \u2018Gulf of America\u2019 in Compliance with TrumpWhat Happened: Axios announced it would use \u201cGulf of America\u201d in its reporting, following Trump\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The move comes after the White House banned the Associated Press\u2019 access to the Oval Office and Air Force One for refusing to adopt the new name.Why It Matters: This highlights the capitulation of media under pressure, raising serious press freedom concerns. The regime is strong-arming outlets to follow its narrative, a hallmark of authoritarian regimes where the government dictates editorial decisions and propaganda\u2014eroding free speech and journalistic independence.Source: The Hill\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsTrump\u2019s Anti-DEI Order Blocks National Guard from Honoring Frederick DouglassWhat Happened: The Maryland National Guard refused to participate in a Frederick Douglass parade, citing the Pentagon\u2019s new ban on \u201cidentity months\u201d like Black History Month. The Massachusetts National Guard also withdrew, forcing organizers to cancel the parade portion of the event. Why It Matters: The cancellation highlights the direct impact of Trump\u2019s anti-DEI policies, erasing historical and cultural recognition efforts. With plans to expand these directives, more community events and federal programs promoting diversity will face similar restrictions. This is also part of a broader attempt by the Trump regime to rewrite history.Source: Mother JonesSchools serving military service members\u2019 kids are pulling books on civil rights history after Trump\u2019s DEI threatsWhat Happened: The DoD Education Activity (DoDEA) ordered military schools to remove books on civil rights, diversity, and Native American history, citing Trump\u2019s executive orders. Black History Month events and cultural observances are also banned.Why It Matters: This is censorship and the weaponization of government agencies to erase history. The American Library Association condemned it as a violation of First Amendment rights.Source: The IndependentGOP-Led States Rapidly Mirror Trump\u2019s AgendaWhat Happened: Republican states are swiftly enacting Trump\u2019s policies on immigration, school choice, and government restructuring, aligning with his regime\u2019s push to cut government programs and target DEI initiatives. States like Florida and Tennessee have passed strict immigration laws, while Ohio and Arkansas are pushing work requirements for Medicaid.Why It Matters: GOP states are weaponizing state power to enforce Trump\u2019s policies, mirroring authoritarian governance tactics. More than nine states have launched fake \u201cDOGE\u201d task forces, mimicking Elon Musk\u2019s illegal federal purge. Meanwhile, Democrats warn of deepening chaos, rights rollbacks, and an emboldened conservative movement at the state level.Source: CNNEEOC Drops Transgender Discrimination Cases Under Trump OrderWhat Happened: The EEOC moved to dismiss six gender identity discrimination cases, citing Trump\u2019s executive order recognizing only biological sex. Trump also removed two Democratic commissioners and the EEOC general counsel, clearing the way for this shift.Why It Matters: This weakens workplace protections for transgender and nonbinary employees, reversing prior civil rights enforcement, and is discriminatory and an abandonment of the agency\u2019s mission.Source: CBS NewsCDC 'disease detectors' among hundreds fired as Trump ramps up agency cutsWhat Happened: Trump fired hundreds of CDC employees, including disease detection fellows who handle outbreak response. Many had excellent performance reviews, but were dismissed for \u201cpoor performance.\u201dWhy It Matters: Cuts to frontline public health programs weaken U.S. disease response amid bird flu and measles outbreaks, leaving the country vulnerable to future health crises.Source: NBC NewsTrump Aid Freeze Threatens HIV Treatment in South AfricaWhat Happened: Trump's global foreign aid freeze has disrupted HIV programs in South Africa, affecting millions of patients reliant on U.S.-funded treatment. The suspension of PEPFAR, which funds 17% of South Africa\u2019s HIV programs, has led to clinic closures, staff layoffs, and medication shortages.Why It Matters: Health workers warn of rising HIV infections and deaths as patients struggle to access care. Experts say the aid freeze abandons vulnerable communities and undermines U.S. global health leadership.Source: Politico\ud83d\udcc9 Government Collapse WatchDOGE Data Release Sparks Intel Community Alarm; Trump Dismisses ConcernsWhat Happened: Elon Musk\u2019s FAKE DOGE posted details about the National Reconnaissance Office\u2014the agency overseeing U.S. intelligence satellites\u2014on its website, including workforce size and budget information. Intelligence officials called it a significant security breach.Why It Matters: Security experts warn revealing intelligence agency staffing and budget details will jeopardize national security and expose personnel to foreign threats. This further reiterates that unvetted Musk operatives have zero business handling sensitive classified data and operating with unchecked power.Source: ABC NewsTrump wants to un-fire nuclear safety workers but can\u2019t figure out how to reach themWhat Happened: Trump mistakenly fired National Nuclear Security Administration employees, then failed to contact them for reinstatement because their government emails were deactivated. The NNSA oversees the U.S. nuclear stockpile and tracks nuclear threats, including those in Ukraine.Why It Matters: The firings jeopardize national security, disrupting oversight of America\u2019s nuclear arsenal at a time of heightened global tensions. Musk and his operatives continue to help our adversaries\u2014China and Russia.Source: NBC NewsTrump's FDA Cuts Target Food Safety and Medical OversightWhat Happened: Trump has fired FDA staff responsible for food safety, medical devices, and tobacco oversight, as part of a broader 5,200-worker purge at HHS agencies. The cuts hit probationary employees, particularly those reviewing food additives, medical devices, and e-cigarettes.Why It Matters: Slashing FDA oversight weakens food and drug safety, limits consumer protections, and risks regulatory capture by private industry. Experts warn this will cripple hiring and inspections, worsening an already strained workforce.Source: The GuardianTrump Slashes Democracy & Election Security ProgramsWhat Happened: Trump halted USAID and State Department democracy programs, fired key contractors, and paused all DHS election security efforts, sidelining officials and removing anti-disinformation resources.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s cuts are deliberately weakening election protections, aiding authoritarian regimes, and dismantling democratic safeguards. This is part of his broader power grab to eliminate oversight, consolidate control, and pave the way for unchecked authoritarian rule.Source: CNN\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Offers Concessions to Putin Ahead of U.S.-Russia Talks\u2014Without UkraineWhat Happened: Trump is moving toward a deal with Russia on Ukraine, excluding European allies and attempting to weaken Kyiv's position. Trump is planning a direct meeting with Putin, while Secretary of State Rubio and other officials will \u201crepresent\u201d the U.S. at Saudi-hosted talks. European leaders, alarmed by the shift, are holding an emergency summit in Paris.Why It Matters: Trump is betraying Ukraine, undermining Western unity, emboldening authoritarianism, and legitimizing Russia\u2019s genocidal invasion. His hostility toward NATO, alignment with far-right and Nazi parties in Europe, and willingness to hold talks without Ukraine hand Putin a strategic victory\u2014 reshaping global security in Moscow\u2019s favor.Source: CNNPutin Has Long Wanted More Power in Europe. Trump Could Grant ItWhat Happened: At the Munich Security Conference, VP Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested the U.S. may move away from Europe and take a softer stance on Russia. Vance criticized European governments for restraining far-right parties\u2014many linked to Russian influence\u2014while Hegseth warned Europe not to assume continued U.S. military support.Why It Matters: This marks a major geopolitical shift, weakening NATO and handing Putin a long-sought victory. Trump is carrying out Russia\u2019s strategic goals at the expense of U.S. allies and national security.Source: The New York TimesAs Trump Gifts Putin, He Betrays UkraineWhat Happened: At the Munich Security Conference, Vance shocked European leaders by downplaying Russia\u2019s threat and launching an ideological attack on Europe, accusing it of stifling free speech and religion. Why It Matters: European leaders see Trump\u2019s policies as a betrayal of NATO and Western unity, handing Putin a strategic victory. The New York Times describes this as a \u201cpreviously unthinkable victory\u201d for Putin, reshaping the global balance of power.Source: The GuardianTrump Official Behind USAID Dismantling Met With Christian Nationalists AbroadWhat Happened: Peter Marocco, now overseeing foreign aid in the Trump regime, secretly met with sanctioned Bosnian Serb operatives in 2018 while serving at the State Department. The meeting, which defied U.S. policy, legitimized far-right nationalist leaders pushing for a Christian Serb state. Now, as head of foreign assistance, Marocco has gutted USAID funding, sidelined staff, and is shutting down aid programs globally.Why It Matters: Marocco\u2019s history of prioritizing Christian nationalist policies over U.S. diplomatic objectives raises alarms about his role in dismantling foreign aid. His actions weaken U.S. influence, escalate sectarian tensions abroad, and align with far-right authoritarian movements.Source: ProPublicaDOGE Official Cited Holocaust Denier as InfluenceWhat Happened: Gavin Kliger, a Musk operative dismantling our agencies and gaining access to our information, credited Holocaust denier Ron Unz for his political awakening in a now-deleted post. Kliger\u2019s social media history includes amplifying white nationalist Nick Fuentes and advocating for military tribunals for undocumented immigrants.Why It Matters: A key DOGE operative embracing extremist views highlights the pattern of white nationalist influence within Musk\u2019s federal overhaul. With Musk gaining control over agencies, radical ideologies are shaping U.S. policy.Source: Mother Jones\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance NewsNationwide Protests Planned for Presidents Day Against Trump PoliciesWhat Happened: The 50501 Movement is organizing protests across all 50 states on Presidents Day to oppose the Trump regime, including executive orders aimed at cutting federal agencies and rescinding DEI policies. Protesters are also calling for Elon Musk\u2019s removal from his government role and demanding investigations into Trump\u2019s appointees, particularly those tied to Project 2025.Source: NPR\ud83d\udcca By the Numbers400+ \u2014DHS employees fired, weakening cybersecurity, disaster relief, and immigration services.5,200 \u2014HHS workers cut, impacting FDA food safety, CDC disease detection, and Medicare services.3.6M \u2014Pending immigration cases backlog worsened as Trump DOJ fires immigration judges.$400M \u2014HIV funding frozen under Trump\u2019s aid cuts, disrupting treatment in South Africa.9+ \u2014GOP-led states launched DOGE-inspired task forces to gut government oversight.\ud83d\udd0e What to Watch NextTrump-Putin Talks: Will Ukraine be sidelined in Saudi-hosted \u201cnegotiations\u201d as the U.S. capitulates to Russia and Trump hands Putin countless victories?

talk about , I will take two today. The traitor now wanting his own holiday , you have got to be kidding me , next he will be starting construction on his face on MT Rushmore .

Not just our standing with our European allies but throwing the brave Ukraines under the bus. Putin is a ruthless war criminal whose demise can\u2019t come quick enough. I used to be so proud to be an American , the flag would go up outside first thing every morning but the pain I feel for our country has the flag sitting idle until democracy takes hold again and we have our country back.  </span></p><div class=\"show-all-toggle\" role=\"button\"><div class=\"show-all-toggle-label\">Expand full comment</div></div></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex

Trump Tyranny Tracker: Feb 15-16: Weekend Roundup</strong></p><p>Welcome to today\\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\\u2019m breaking down the key news from this weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.</p><div><hr></div><h3>\\uD83D\\uDD25 In Corruption News</h3><p></p><h3><strong>Musk\\u2019s Mass Government Cuts Could Funnel Billions to Private Companies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk is gutting federal agencies, benefiting private companies\\u2014including his own. Defense firms like Lockheed Martin and Palantir expect new contracts, while SpaceX and Starlink expand their grip on NASA and national security. Musk continues to expand his control over federal spending and the government.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>With Trump removing watchdogs, he and Musk face no oversight, accelerating government privatization and funneling billions to regime-aligned cronies\\u2014mirroring Russia\\u2019s oligarch-controlled economy.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/16/elon-musk-doge-government-privatization\\\\\\\">The Guardian</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDEE1\\uFE0F In Power Consolidation News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Musk Seeks IRS Access to Taxpayer Data, Raising Alarm</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Elon Musk is seeking access to IRS taxpayer databases, including the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS), which contains sensitive financial data on millions of Americans. The White House is pressuring the IRS to grant FAKE DOGE operative Gavin Kliger access under the guise of IT modernization and fraud detection. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Granting political appointees access to taxpayer data is unprecedented and dangerous and will lead to potential political targeting, leaks, and abuse. IRS officials fear the move jeopardizes the agency\\u2019s independence, especially as Trump previously floated using the IRS against political opponents. </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/\\\\\\\">The</a></strong></em><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/\\\\\\\"> </a><em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/16/doge-irs-access-taxpayer-data/\\\\\\\">Washington Post</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump DOJ Moves to Control Investigations</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Attorney General Pam Bondi\\u2019s DOJ is dropping cases against Trump allies, including NYC Mayor Eric Adams, prompting mass resignations. The department also demanded FBI agent lists from the Capitol riot probe and sued a state attorney general who won a fraud case against Trump. A new \\\\\\\"Weaponization Working Group\\\\\\\" targets prosecutors who pursued Trump.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The DOJ is being reshaped to protect Trump and punish opponents, undermining prosecutorial independence and shifting law enforcement toward political control.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/fbi-justice-department-trump-bondi-bove-adams-a003af9d9aebe89cd289361a65c9401b\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Thousands of Federal Health Workers Fired Amid DOGE-Led Purge</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Thousands of probationary workers across federal health agencies were fired via letter on Saturday. The CDC, FDA, NIH, and Medicare services were among the affected agencies. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The cuts weaken public health preparedness, affecting agencies managing pandemic stockpiles, disease detection, and medical regulation. The FDA\\u2019s oversight of tobacco and medical devices was hit, despite being funded by industry fees\\u2014not taxpayers. This is a politically driven purge that will cripple health and safety programs.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-of-probationary-federal-health-agency-workers-fired-by-letter-this-weekend/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires 400+ DHS Employees Amid Mass Layoffs</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired over 400 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees, targeting FEMA, CISA, and USCIS as part of a government-wide purge. Probationary workers received identical termination letters, and high-performing recruits were among those let go. Cuts also included Coast Guard DEI staff, reassigned to border duty.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This sweeping purge weakens disaster relief, cybersecurity, and immigration services, while leaving ICE and CBP untouched. The firings continue to prioritize Trump\\u2019s extremist agenda over national security, with CISA\\u2019s election security role particularly at risk.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-fires-over-400-dhs-employees/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires Hundreds of FAA Workers Amid Aviation Safety Crisis</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump fired hundreds of probationary FAA employees responsible for maintaining air traffic control infrastructure, according to their union. The cuts come weeks after a deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., and ongoing FAA system failures.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The firings exacerbate aviation safety risks, especially amid ongoing air traffic controller shortages and recent deadly crashes\\u2014compromising public safety.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/politics/faa-employees-fired-trump-administration/index.html\\\\\\\">CNN</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\u2696\\uFE0F In Weaponization of Institutions News</strong></h3><p></p><h3><strong>Trump Appeals to Supreme Court, Claims \\\\\\\"Unprecedented Assault\\\\\\\" on Presidential Power</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump is asking the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that temporarily reinstated Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers. Dellinger was fired without cause as part of Trump's federal workforce purge. The Justice Department argues the ruling improperly restricts presidential authority.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This case is a major test of executive power. A Supreme Court win for Trump would set a precedent for purging watchdog agencies and silencing whistleblowers\\u2014handing him Putin-like control over government oversight.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/personnel-elon-musks-doge-arrive-pentagon-2025-02-15/\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>DOE Threatens Schools Over \\u2018Discriminatory\\u2019 DEI Policies</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>The Department of Education issued a four-page memo warning all schools to DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor declared race-based decision-making \\\\\\\"impermissible\\\\\\\" and gave schools 14 days to comply.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The memo is part of the Trump regime\\u2019s broader effort to dismantle DEI initiatives, following executive orders targeting race-conscious policies in federal agencies, education, and corporate governance. This move mirrors authoritarian tactics to suppress marginalized communities and erode civil rights protections.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/15/doge-education-department-dei-cuts-019574\\\\\\\">Politico</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Trump Fires \\u2018Exceptional\\u2019 DOT Workers, Citing \\u2018Performance\\u2019 Issues</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump fired dozens of Department of Transportation employees, citing poor performance, despite supervisors rating them as \\u2018exceptional.\\u2019 </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>These rapid and disorganized layoffs raise concerns about politicized firings and a lack of due process, especially as some terminations are already being reversed due to errors.

At least five assistant chief judges and 13 judicial candidates were dismissed.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The move worsens an already record-high immigration case backlog, contradicting Trump\\u2019s mass deportation plans, which need more judges to process removals. The politically motivated firings will cripple the immigration court system just as Trump escalates enforcement\\u2014reinforcing that his regime has no intention of offering undocumented immigrants their due process.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-fires-multiple-immigration-judges-case-backlog-rcna192365\\\\\\\">NBC News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Ocasio-Cortez on Homan suggesting she\\u2019s \\u2018gonna be in trouble\\u2019</strong></h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Tom Homan, Trump\\u2019s \\u201Cborder czar,\\u201D suggested Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) could be in legal trouble for educating migrants on their rights. Homan, appearing on Fox News, questioned whether her efforts impeded law enforcement and said he was working with the DOJ to determine if she had \\u201Ccrossed the line.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is an authoritarian weaponization of federal agencies against opposition.

Trump is firing key labor officials, nullifying federal union contracts, and disbanding DEI programs. Meanwhile, Musk and Bezos are backing efforts to shut down the NLRB entirely, leaving workers with little recourse against corporate power.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump and Musk are weaponizing the government to crush labor rights, while anti-union billionaires like Musk and Bezos push to dismantle the NLRB entirely.

The White House reshared it with his mugshot. This further shows Trump is positioning himself above the law. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The post highlights that Trump is laying the groundwork for authoritarian rule, justifying rule-breaking as necessary for \\\\\\\"saving the country,\\\\\\\" as his regime moves to consolidate power, purge government workers, and weaken legal oversight.

Texas also fined Carpenter $100,000 for prescribing abortion medication across state lines, citing an alleged violation of state law for practicing without a local license.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Republican-led states are becoming increasingly emboldened, using indictments and extradition requests to target doctors providing abortion care across state lines.

The \\u201CTrump\\u2019s Birthday and Flag Day Holiday Establishment Act\\u201D seeks to honor Trump\\u2019s \\u201Clegacy\\u201D alongside the annual observance of Flag Day.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The bill, absurdly comparing Trump to George Washington, is part of a broader effort to enshrine his \\u201Clegacy\\u201D into U.S. law.

The ad criticized Musk\\u2019s unchecked influence in the Trump regime and was set to appear as a wraparound on the paper's front and back pages, targeting Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The decision raises concerns about media independence and highlights the Post currying favor with the Trump regime.

The move comes after the White House banned the Associated Press\\u2019 access to the Oval Office and Air Force One for refusing to adopt the new name.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This highlights the capitulation of media under pressure, raising serious press freedom concerns.

The Massachusetts National Guard also withdrew, forcing organizers to cancel the parade portion of the event. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The cancellation highlights the direct impact of Trump\\u2019s anti-DEI policies, erasing historical and cultural recognition efforts.

States like Florida and Tennessee have passed strict immigration laws, while Ohio and Arkansas are pushing work requirements for Medicaid.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>GOP states are weaponizing state power to enforce Trump\\u2019s policies, mirroring authoritarian governance tactics.

Trump also removed two Democratic commissioners and the EEOC general counsel, clearing the way for this shift.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This weakens workplace protections for transgender and nonbinary employees, reversing prior civil rights enforcement, and is discriminatory and an abandonment of the agency\\u2019s mission.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eeoc-transgender-discrimination-cases/\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></p><div><hr></div><h3>CDC 'disease detectors' among hundreds fired as Trump ramps up agency cuts</h3><p><strong>What Happened: </strong>Trump fired hundreds of CDC employees, including disease detection fellows who handle outbreak response.
