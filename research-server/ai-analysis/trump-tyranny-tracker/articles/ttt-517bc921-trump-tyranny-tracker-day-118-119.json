Source: Ken M\u00fcrk/ERRShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: May 17-18Welcome to this weekend\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I break down the key news from the weekend alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.I\u2019m truly saddened by the heartbreaking news of President Biden\u2019s cancer diagnosis. Praying for his speedy recovery. He is a decent man and has been a fighter all his life, overcoming so many challenges. Wishing him and his family strength during this difficult time.Don\u2019t forget to tune into Trump Tyranny Tracker LIVE with Zev Shalev\u2014Monday through Friday at 2:00 PM EST.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump meme coin dinner likely to include mostly non-Americans based on top $TRUMP holdersWhat Happened: Ahead of Trump\u2019s private May 22 dinner for top $TRUMP memecoin holders, blockchain analysis shows that 19 of the top 25 wallets belong to foreign nationals\u2014mostly through platforms like Binance and Singapore-based exchanges. Why It Matters: Trump continues selling political access to foreigners through an unregulated memecoin. This isn\u2019t just unethical\u2014it\u2019s a glaring national security risk. Trump is running a global pay-to-play racket, powered by crypto and zero oversight.Source: CNBCBreaking Down Trump\u2019s Entanglements With CryptoWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s second term has turned crypto into a goldmine for his inner circle. His family is tied to multiple ventures\u2014including the $TRUMP memecoin, secretive Binance investment talks, and World Liberty Financial\u2019s UAE-backed stablecoin. Why It Matters: This is textbook corruption. Trump is profiting from crypto while writing the rules for it\u2014a blatant conflict of interest that erases any remaining ethical lines. He\u2019s using the presidency as a personal business venture.Source: Wall Street JournalTrump the GrifterWhat Happened: Trump is violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses\u2014taking bribes, crypto cash, and foreign favors without approval. From Qatar jets to pay-for-access dinners, the grift is nonstop.Why It Matters: This is what the Founders tried to prevent\u2014a president using the office to get rich. And the system\u2019s failing to stop it.Source: The Atlantic\u2018Very disturbing\u2019: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warnWhat Happened: Trump is under fire for accepting lavish foreign bribes\u2014including a $400 million jet from Qatar and a $2 billion crypto investment from the UAE\u2014while his family profits from international deals. Why It Matters: Trump is violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, turning U.S. foreign policy into a pay-for-access scheme while national security is compromised by unchecked foreign influence.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump\u2019s clash with the courts raises prospect of showdown over separation of powersWhat Happened: Trump is defying court orders\u2014including on disappearances under the Alien Enemies Act\u2014while a new GOP budget bill guts enforcement of contempt rulings. Judges say the White House is ignoring the law, and Trump allies and officials are urging outright defiance.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on the judiciary. Trump is testing whether courts can be ignored\u2014and he's getting away with it. If judges can't enforce rulings, the rule of law is broken.Source: Associated PressHow DOGE has tried to embed beyond the executive branchWhat Happened: Musk tried to embed staffers in independent and legislative agencies like the GAO, Peace Corps, and NEH. The GAO rejected Musk\u2019s request, saying it falls outside executive authority. Musk operatives have also approached nonprofits like CPB and the Vera Institute, often demanding budget data and staff purges.Why It Matters: Musk\u2019s operatives are invading agencies beyond executive control, triggering alarms over legality, power grabs, and the destruction of vital public services. Source: NPRTrump orders the government to stop enforcing rules he doesn\u2019t likeWhat Happened: Trump has ordered agencies to stop enforcing laws he doesn\u2019t like\u2014from anti-discrimination rules to pipeline safety and environmental protections. Key departments have been told to \u201ccease and desist,\u201d gutting enforcement across the board.Why It Matters: This is an illegal power grab. Trump is sidelining Congress and rewriting the law by decree, dismantling regulatory oversight, and erasing the rule of law in real time.Source: The Washington Post\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsWith Comey questioning, Trump again targets speechWhat Happened: After James Comey posted \u201c86 47\u201d in seashells, Trump officials launched a criminal investigation, claiming it was a \u201cthreat.\u201d DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and DNI Tulsi Gabbard called for Comey\u2019s arrest, while the Secret Service and FBI opened formal inquiries.Why It Matters: This is part of Trump\u2019s broader pattern of using federal power to intimidate critics and punish dissent, criminalizing speech protected under the First Amendment. It\u2019s a direct attack on free speech and just the beginning of his retribution.Source: The Washington PostFamilies Slam DOJ Deal Letting Boeing Dodge Prosecution for 737 MAX CrashesWhat Happened: Families of victims killed in two Boeing 737 MAX crashes plan to formally object to a tentative nonprosecution deal that would let Boeing avoid being labeled a convicted felon. The deal would halt a scheduled fraud trial over Boeing\u2019s alleged deception of regulators and instead impose a fine and victim compensation.Why It Matters: Families call it \u201ca step backward\u201d that denies accountability for what a judge called \u201cthe deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.\u201d The DOJ is shielding a powerful corporation from real consequences.Source: ReutersNonprofit leaders brace for possible targeting by Trump after tax measure advances in CongressWhat Happened: A House GOP measure backed by Trump would let the Treasury revoke tax-exempt status from nonprofits deemed \u201cterrorist supporting.\u201d The rule lacks due process and will be weaponized to punish political opponents. It comes as Trump\u2019s DOJ investigates universities and groups using DEI policies and antisemitism as cover.Why It Matters: Nonprofit leaders fear this will trigger a crackdown on dissent, weaponizing federal power to silence opposition. Legal experts warn it could chill civil society, with major groups already preparing for audits and politically driven investigations. The move echoes Russia\u2019s foreign agent law, which was used to shut down the last independent voices.Source: CNNI just wrote about this. Please take a moment to read and call Congress.

Ignoring economists\u2019 warnings about inflation, Trump insisted Walmart \u201cEAT THE TARIFFS\u201d and warned, \u201cI\u2019ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is trying to coerce private companies into aligning with his agenda, making threats for noncompliance. State intimidation undermines free market principles.Source: Associated PressOklahoma Injects 2020 Election Conspiracies Into High School CurriculumWhat Happened: Oklahoma\u2019s new K-12 social studies standards, pushed by pro-Trump Superintendent Ryan Walters, require students to \u201cidentify discrepancies\u201d in the 2020 election\u2014promoting conspiracy theories and lies about ballot dumps and mail-in voting. Why It Matters: Oklahoma is institutionalizing election disinformation in public education, turning classrooms into political battlegrounds. It\u2019s part of a wider MAGA effort to rewrite history and indoctrinate youth with MAGA propaganda.Source: Associated PressTrump Threatens ABC Over Qatar Jet Reporting, Issues \u2018Fair Warning\u2019What Happened: Trump lashed out at ABC News on Truth Social over coverage of the $400 million jet bribe by Qatar, accusing the network of falsely suggesting the \u201cgift\u201d was for him personally. He threatened Chairman Bob Iger and called the journalists \u201cSleazeBags.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump\u2019s threats against media outlets for fact-based reporting reiterate his authoritarian impulse to intimidate the free press and control public narratives, mirroring tactics used by autocrats to suppress accountability.Source: MediaiteTrump peddles false conspiracy theories tying Clintons to several deathsWhat Happened: Trump spread conspiracy theories and lies on Truth Social, claiming the Clintons were linked to multiple suspicious deaths. The video, labeled \u201cTHE VIDEO HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE,\u201d was widely shared by Trump and his political operatives.Why It Matters: Spreading baseless criminal accusations, especially murder, against political opponents is a classic authoritarian tactic\u2014used to dehumanize opposition, incite fear, and justify future crackdowns. Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsFederal Courts\u2019 Emerging Bottom Line: Due Process Rights for ImmigrantsWhat Happened: The Supreme Court and other federal courts have ruled that immigrants must be given due process before deportation, rejecting Trump\u2019s attempt to remove migrants with as little as 24 hours' notice. Judges have also blocked disappearances to third countries like El Salvador and Libya without proper warning or legal recourse.Why It Matters: Courts are resisting Trump\u2019s attempts to erode constitutional protections, but his open defiance of due process is a direct assault on the rule of law. Safeguards remain\u2014for now\u2014but the system is under sustained threat.Source: New York TimesVietnamese Man Nearly Deported to Libya After Routine ICE Check-InWhat Happened: A Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles was among 13 immigrants abruptly pulled from a Texas detention center and nearly disappeared to Libya, despite having no ties to the country. Lawyers said the men were shackled at 2:30 a.m. and denied due process.Why It Matters: This case reiterates Trump\u2019s chaotic and unlawful tactics, where due process is routinely bypassed. Mistaken identities and illegal transfers are becoming alarmingly common as the regime prioritizes mass disappearances over Constitutional protections.Source: Los Angeles TimesICE Adopts New Tactic: Deport Before TrialWhat Happened: ICE is deporting suspects, witnesses, and defendants before their trials, derailing cases involving assault, attempted murder, and fraud in cities like Denver and Boston. Prosecutors say critical proceedings are collapsing mid-investigation due to sudden removals.Why It Matters: This undermines justice, erodes due process, and endangers public safety when suspects return and reoffend. Legal experts warn it reflects a politicized abuse of immigration powers to override the legal system itself.Source: USA TodayICE Officials Just Admitted to Another Major Deportation ErrorWhat Happened: ICE admitted it wrongly deported a Guatemalan asylum seeker, O.C.G., to Mexico under Trump\u2019s \u201cthird country\u201d policy based on a false claim he wasn\u2019t afraid to return. The government now says no ICE agent verified that claim, blaming a faulty data entry system.Why It Matters: The error undermines the government\u2019s legal defense in a major class-action suit and highlights a growing pattern of rushed, rights-violating disappearances. O.C.G.\u2014a gay man who says he was raped and held for ransom in Mexico\u2014remains stranded despite a judge previously granting protection.Source: Mother Jones17 family members of notorious cartel leader enter U.S. in deal with Trump administration, Mexico saysWhat Happened: Mexico\u2019s security chief confirmed that 17 family members of Sinaloa cartel leader Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, including El Chapo\u2019s ex-wife and daughter, entered the U.S. last week under a secret deal with Trump officials. The crossing follows rumors that Guzm\u00e1n is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors to avoid trial.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s backdoor deal with cartel leaders raises explosive questions about transparency, justice, and U.S. negotiations with narco-terrorists.Source: CBS NewsU.S. funding halted Africa\u2019s HIV crisis. Trump\u2019s cuts have forced a reckoning.What Happened: Trump gutted funding for PEPFAR, the U.S. program that helped turn the tide on the HIV/AIDS crisis in Eswatini, once the global epicenter of the epidemic. The withdrawal has left the country scrambling to sustain care at the U.S.-backed Miracle Campus and forced health officials to confront a future without American support.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s aid cuts dismantle a 20-year success story in global health, risking a resurgence of preventable deaths and having devastating consequences for vulnerable communities.Source: The Washington Post\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchAfter Cuts, a Kentucky Weather Office Scrambles for Staffing as Severe Storms Bear DownWhat Happened: Devastating storms swept through the central U.S., killing at least 28 people, including 19 in Kentucky, just as the National Weather Service office in Jackson operated without overnight staff due to Musk\u2019s purges. Nearly 600 NWS employees have been purged nationwide, leaving several offices unable to provide round-the-clock forecasting.Why It Matters: As deadly tornadoes hit, Trump\u2019s cuts to federal weather services are leaving Americans vulnerable. Experts say dismantling the National Weather Service during escalating climate crises risks turning natural disasters into mass-casualty events.Source: New York TimesTrump budget would cut ocean data and leave boaters, anglers and forecasters scrambling for infoWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 2026 budget would eliminate all $43.5 million in federal support for NOAA\u2019s Integrated Ocean Observing System, a critical source of real-time data for harbor pilots, weather forecasters, and military operations.Why It Matters: Slashing this vital ocean monitoring system endangers maritime safety and disaster response. Experts say the move is like \u201cturning off the headlights in a storm\u201d\u2014reckless, shortsighted, and a direct threat to lives and national security.Source: Associated PressTrump Cuts Library Grants, E-Books and Jobs Slashed NationwideWhat Happened: Libraries nationwide are slashing staff and services after Trump suspended federal funding by targeting the Institute of Museum and Library Services. States like Maine and Mississippi have already laid off workers and paused key programs, even as judges temporarily block further cuts.Why It Matters: This is a direct attack on free access to information. Defunding libraries cripples public education and digital access\u2014especially for rural, low-income, and underserved communities. It\u2019s a coordinated assault on America\u2019s free speech and knowledge infrastructure.Source: Associated PressEnergized by Kennedy, Texas \u2018Mad Moms\u2019 Are Chipping Away at Vaccine MandatesWhat Happened: With measles spreading in Texas, anti-vaccine activists known as the \u201cMad Moms\u201d are pushing over 60 bills to weaken mandates. Recent Texas legislation advances opt-outs, bans vaccine ads, and \u201cprotects\u201d unvaccinated patients from medical discrimination.Why It Matters: RFK Jr.\u2019s appointment has supercharged the anti-vaccine movement, threatening decades of public health gains. As outbreaks rise, aligning federal policy with vaccine denialism will erode national immunization standards and put millions at risk.Source: New York TimesCooking the books? Fears Trump could target statisticians if data disappointsWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s proposed rule would let him fire civil servants, including economists and statisticians, who are seen as defying his agenda\u2014raising alarm that agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and BEA could be purged if data contradicts his narrative. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has suggested altering GDP calculations to favor Trump.Why It Matters: This would gut the credibility of U.S. economic data, undermining Fed policy and investor confidence. The move mirrors tactics used in Russia\u2014manipulating facts to serve power, not the public.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchRussia detains oil tanker after leaving Estonian portWhat Happened: Russian authorities detained the Greek-owned Green Admire oil tanker on Sunday after it departed Estonia\u2019s Sillam\u00e4e port, despite using a previously agreed safe passage through Russian waters. The move follows Estonia\u2019s recent attempt to stop a Russian shadow fleet vessel, escalating regional tensions.Why It Matters: Estonia says this is retaliation for its crackdown on Russia\u2019s illegal shadow fleet, which helps Moscow dodge sanctions with unflagged, decrepit oil tankers. As Baltic states step up enforcement, Russia is raising the risk of confrontations inside NATO territory.Source: ERR NewsPope Leo Meets Zelenskyy After Inaugural MassWhat Happened: Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, met privately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his inaugural Mass. The meeting came just before Zelenskyy\u2019s first exchange with Vance since he ambushed Zelenskyy in February at the White House.Source: The TimesCentrist Dan Defeats Pro-Trump Simion in Romanian Presidential UpsetWhat Happened: Bucharest mayor Nicu\u0219or Dan won Romania\u2019s presidency with 54% of the vote, defeating hard-right, Trump-aligned Kremlin loyalist George Simion, who had campaigned to cut Ukraine aid and mimic MAGA policies. Why It Matters: Dan\u2019s victory blocks a pro-Russia, anti-EU shift and signals voter backlash against Trump-style extremism in Europe. It preserves Romania\u2019s support for Ukraine and commitment to NATO, dealing a blow to Kremlin influence and rejection of Trumpism.Source: ReutersA Liberal Takes the Lead in the Critical Vote for Poland\u2019s PresidentWhat Happened: Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski leads the first round of Poland\u2019s presidential election with 30.8%, narrowly ahead of far-right candidate Karol Nowrocki at 29.1%. A runoff is set for June 1.Why It Matters: The presidency holds veto power, and Trzaskowski\u2019s win would aid PM Donald Tusk\u2019s agenda. The second-round election is scheduled for June 1.Source: New York Times\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchRussia launches war's largest drone attack ahead of Putin-Trump callWhat Happened: Russia launched the largest drone attack, sending 273 drones into Ukraine, killing a woman and injuring civilians just one day before Trump\u2019s planned call with Putin. Talks stalled Friday after Russia demanded Ukraine surrender territory and halt Western arms.Why It Matters: The drone assault is a power move, a reminder that Putin holds the upper hand as Trump pressures Kyiv into surrendering on Moscow\u2019s terms.Source: ReutersRussia Plans ICBM Launch to Intimidate West, Says UkraineWhat Happened: Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence reported that Russia intends to launch an RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile from Sverdlovsk in a \"training and combat\" exercise. The move, with a range of over 10,000 km, is seen as a threat aimed at Ukraine, NATO, and EU countries ahead of talks.Why It Matters: Russia\u2019s saber-rattling is nothing new\u2014it\u2019s an old, tired tactic meant to stir panic and gain leverage while trying to put pressure on Europe.Source: ReutersCombat sport clubs used to boost recruitment for white nationalist hate group, report saysWhat Happened: Active Clubs, inspired by white supremacist Robert Rundo, have spread to at least 34 states since 2023. Posing as fitness groups, they promote male supremacy, train for conflict, and serve as feeder networks for groups like Patriot Front.Why It Matters: \u201cWhite nationalism 3.0\u201d is expanding through decentralized, leaderless cells like Active Clubs, which operate under the radar while grooming new recruits. As Patriot Front faces lawsuits and scrutiny, these clubs are filling the void\u2014just as Trump\u2019s FBI has intentionally deprioritized domestic terror monitoring, allowing extremist groups to grow with little oversight or accountability.Source: CBS News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump Pressures Fed for Rate Cuts, Slams PowellWhat Happened: Trump publicly urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates \u201csooner, rather than later\u201d and again pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell on social media. He claimed there is \u201cwidespread agreement\u201d on the need for rate cuts to boost the economy.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s direct pressure on the Fed threatens the central bank\u2019s independence, and undermining Powell will destabilize investor confidence.Source: ReutersMoody's downgrade intensifies investor worry about US fiscal pathWhat Happened: Moody\u2019s downgraded the U.S. credit rating by one notch, citing rising deficits and a $36 trillion national debt. The move has rattled investors, especially as Trump pushes a tax package tied to a debt ceiling hike, with bond markets already flashing warning signs.Why It Matters: The downgrade underscores growing alarm over U.S. fiscal instability under Trump\u2019s economic agenda. Investor anxiety could drive up borrowing costs, shrink confidence, and fuel a financial reckoning.Source: Reuters\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc In Resistance News6/6- Next National Day of ActionCheck out the link for other local events\u2026Source: 50501Valor Media Network: Veterans UniteSpringsteen, Undeterred by Trump, Keeps Up War of Words From Foreign StageWhat Happened: Bruce Springsteen fired back at Trump during a concert in Manchester, U.K., after Trump warned him to \u201ckeep his mouth shut\u201d overseas.

Prices are already spiking, and manufacturers warn of supply chain disruptions. This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Crypto Corruption at the Core \u2014 Trump is personally profiting off memecoins and UAE-backed stablecoins while shaping federal crypto policy, blurring the line between public power and private gain.Authoritarianism in Plain Sight \u2014 Whether it\u2019s DOJ probes into nonprofits, court-defying disappearances, or media intimidation campaigns, Trump is preparing to use the machinery of government to punish dissent.Public Services Under Siege \u2014 From libraries to weather offices, Trump\u2019s regime is gutting infrastructure that serves Americans, leaving them exposed as disasters, storms, and outbreaks surge.Justice Is Being Undermined at Every Level \u2014 From ICE deporting trial witnesses to the DOJ shielding corporations from accountability, Trump\u2019s regime is rewriting the rules to protect allies and punish opponents.\ud83d\udea8 Call to ActionDocument Everything: Document purges, corruption, and power grabs.

Hikes</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump publicly threatened Walmart on Truth Social, demanding it absorb the costs of his new tariffs rather than raise consumer prices. Ignoring economists\\u2019 warnings about inflation, Trump insisted Walmart \\u201CEAT THE TARIFFS\\u201D and warned, \\u201CI\\u2019ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is trying to coerce private companies into aligning with his agenda, making threats for noncompliance.

It\\u2019s part of a wider MAGA effort to rewrite history and indoctrinate youth with MAGA propaganda.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-curriculum-2020-election-misinformation-bbc05b14c3d7a858014f6acefc326ec6\\\\\\\">Associated Press</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump Threatens ABC Over Qatar Jet Reporting, Issues \\u2018Fair Warning\\u2019</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump lashed out at ABC News on Truth Social over coverage of the $400 million jet bribe by Qatar, accusing the network of falsely suggesting the \\u201Cgift\\u201D was for him personally. He threatened Chairman Bob Iger and called the journalists \\u201CSleazeBags.\\u201D</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s threats against media outlets for fact-based reporting reiterate his authoritarian impulse to intimidate the free press and control public narratives, mirroring tactics used by autocrats to suppress accountability.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/trump-threatens-abc-over-coverage-of-qatar-jet-im-warning-these-sleazebags/\\\\\\\">Mediaite</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Trump peddles false conspiracy theories tying Clintons to several deaths</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump spread conspiracy theories and lies on Truth Social, claiming the Clintons were linked to multiple suspicious deaths. The video, labeled \\u201CTHE VIDEO HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE,\\u201D was widely shared by Trump and his political operatives.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Spreading baseless criminal accusations, especially murder, against political opponents is a classic authoritarian tactic\\u2014used to dehumanize opposition, incite fear, and justify future crackdowns. </p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/17/trump-clinton-false-conspiracy-theories/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDED1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>Federal Courts\\u2019 Emerging Bottom Line: Due Process Rights for Immigrants</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The Supreme Court and other federal courts have ruled that immigrants must be given due process before deportation, rejecting Trump\\u2019s attempt to remove migrants with as little as 24 hours' notice. Judges have also blocked disappearances to third countries like El Salvador and Libya without proper warning or legal recourse.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Courts are resisting Trump\\u2019s attempts to erode constitutional protections, but his open defiance of due process is a direct assault on the rule of law. Safeguards remain\\u2014for now\\u2014but the system is under sustained threat.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/us/politics/courts-immigrants-venezuelans-garcia-trump.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Vietnamese Man Nearly Deported to Libya After Routine ICE Check-In</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles was among 13 immigrants abruptly pulled from a Texas detention center and nearly disappeared to Libya, despite having no ties to the country. Lawyers said the men were shackled at 2:30 a.m. and denied due process.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This case reiterates Trump\\u2019s chaotic and unlawful tactics, where due process is routinely bypassed. Mistaken identities and illegal transfers are becoming alarmingly common as the regime prioritizes mass disappearances over Constitutional protections.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-15/l-a-vietnamese-immigrant-among-those-told-he-would-be-deported-to-libya-lawyer\\\\\\\">Los Angeles Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>ICE Adopts New Tactic: Deport Before Trial</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE is deporting suspects, witnesses, and defendants before their trials, derailing cases involving assault, attempted murder, and fraud in cities like Denver and Boston. Prosecutors say critical proceedings are collapsing mid-investigation due to sudden removals.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This undermines justice, erodes due process, and endangers public safety when suspects return and reoffend. Legal experts warn it reflects a politicized abuse of immigration powers to override the legal system itself.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/18/ice-tactic-deport-before-court-immigration/83515061007/?tbref=hp\\\\\\\">USA Today</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>ICE Officials Just Admitted to Another Major Deportation Error</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> ICE admitted it wrongly deported a Guatemalan asylum seeker, O.C.G., to Mexico under Trump\\u2019s \\u201Cthird country\\u201D policy based on a false claim he wasn\\u2019t afraid to return. The government now says no ICE agent verified that claim, blaming a faulty data entry system.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The error undermines the government\\u2019s legal defense in a major class-action suit and highlights a growing pattern of rushed, rights-violating disappearances.

The crossing follows rumors that Guzm\\u00E1n is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors to avoid trial.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s backdoor deal with cartel leaders raises explosive questions about transparency, justice, and U.S. negotiations with narco-terrorists.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sinaloa-cartel-leader-family-enters-us-deal-trump-administration-mexico/???/=&amp;ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=820349402\\\\\\\">CBS News</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>U.S. funding halted Africa\\u2019s HIV crisis.

The withdrawal has left the country scrambling to sustain care at the U.S.-backed Miracle Campus and forced health officials to confront a future without American support.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s aid cuts dismantle a 20-year success story in global health, risking a resurgence of preventable deaths and having devastating consequences for vulnerable communities.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/05/18/usaid-withdrawal-africa-healthcare/\\\\\\\">The Washington Post</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCC9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse Watch</strong></h3><p></p><h3>After Cuts, a Kentucky Weather Office Scrambles for Staffing as Severe Storms Bear Down</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Devastating storms swept through the central U.S., killing at least 28 people, including 19 in Kentucky, just as the National Weather Service office in Jackson operated without overnight staff due to Musk\\u2019s purges. Nearly 600 NWS employees have been purged nationwide, leaving several offices unable to provide round-the-clock forecasting.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> As deadly tornadoes hit, Trump\\u2019s cuts to federal weather services are leaving Americans vulnerable.

States like Maine and Mississippi have already laid off workers and paused key programs, even as judges temporarily block further cuts.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a direct attack on free access to information.
