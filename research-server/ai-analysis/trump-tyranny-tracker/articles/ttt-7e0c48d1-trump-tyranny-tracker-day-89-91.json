Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesShare\ud83d\udcc6 Trump Tyranny Tracker: April 18-20Welcome to today\u2019s Trump Tyranny Tracker, where I\u2019m breaking down the key news from the day alongside ongoing developments as Trump and his regime move swiftly to consolidate power, undermine democracy, and dismantle civil rights and freedoms.Note: Due to the holiday weekend, this roundup covers Friday through Sunday. I hope everyone had a relaxing and peaceful holiday.\ud83d\udd25 In Corruption NewsTrump White House Solicits Corporate Sponsors for Easter Egg RollWhat Happened: For the first time ever, the White House is selling corporate sponsorships for the Easter Egg Roll\u2014Amazon, Meta, and YouTube ranging from $75,000 to $200,000. The move comes amid scrutiny of Trump\u2019s ties to tech billionaires and accusations of pay-to-play influence.Why It Matters: Trump is monetizing a children\u2019s holiday, turning the Easter Egg Roll into a corporate cash grab. It\u2019s classic kleptocracy\u2014where nothing is sacred and everything, even Easter, is for sale.Source: NPR\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f In Power Consolidation NewsTrump to reclassify many federal workers, making them easier to fireWhat Happened: Trump announced a sweeping reclassification of federal workers under a new \u201cschedule policy/career\u201d category\u2014an expanded version of his old \u201cSchedule F\u201d order. The move guts civil service protections and makes it easier to purge career employees. Over 260,000 have already been purged or flagged for removal and this could affect hundreds of thousands more.Why It Matters: This is a mass purge to consolidate power. Trump is dismantling the professional, nonpartisan civil service and replacing it with a loyalty-based system\u2014one step closer to authoritarian rule. It\u2019s not about efficiency\u2014it\u2019s about power, control, and silencing dissent inside the government.Source: CNBCLaw firms, universities, civil society groups in Trump's sights for punitive actionWhat Happened: Trump announced plans to review and potentially revoke the tax-exempt status of major institutions he sees as political enemies, including Harvard University, environmental groups, and watchdog nonprofit CREW. This follows a series of executive actions aimed at law firms and universities critical of his regime. Trump is abusing executive power to try to silence dissent and cripple civil society.Why It Matters: This is authoritarianism in action. Trump is weaponizing the federal government to punish critics and dismantle the institutions, watchdogs, and organizations that hold him accountable. Source: ABC NewsTrump draft order calls for drastic restructure of state departmentWhat Happened: A leaked draft executive order outlines Trump\u2019s plan to radically restructure the State Department\u2014gutting bureaus tied to climate, human rights, refugees, democracy, and gender equality. The proposal slashes African operations, eliminates the UN liaison office, cancels DEI initiatives, and restricts Fulbright scholarships to national security fields. Why It Matters: This is a full-scale takeover of U.S. diplomacy. Trump is dismantling global engagement, erasing human rights and climate diplomacy, and installing a loyalty-based foreign service. It\u2019s the end of U.S. global leadership.Source: The Guardian\u2696\ufe0f In Weaponization of Institutions NewsTrump Demands Harvard Records on Foreign Funds and StudentsWhat Happened: Trump accused Harvard of \u201cfailing\u201d to report large foreign donations and is demanding extensive records on all foreign students, scholars, and donors going back more than a decade. This comes after Harvard refused to comply with Trump\u2019s political demands to overhaul its admissions, faculty, and disciplinary policies. In retaliation, the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal grants and threatened Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status.Why It Matters: This political blackmail, along with fabricated cases, is one of the most common tactics used in Russia. Trump is weaponizing the federal government to punish universities that defy his authoritarian agenda. Harvard stood its ground\u2014but the assault on academic freedom, privacy, and institutional independence is a dire warning to every university.Source: New York TimesTrump\u2019s DC Attorney Recycles Russian Propaganda to Smear Mueller ProsecutorWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s acting U.S. attorney in D.C., Ed Martin, accused former Mueller prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky of \u201cmisconduct\u201d using language lifted from a 2020 far-right article. Martin\u2014who\u2019s appeared over 150 times on Russian state TV and hired Trump allies, Michael Caputo and Neil McCabe,\u2014faces bipartisan backlash and possible disbarment.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s Justice Department is recycling disinformation and Kremlin garbage propaganda to rewrite the history of Russia\u2019s attack on U.S. election and discredit investigators. It\u2019s a dangerous abuse of prosecutorial power and a clear move to curry favor with Trump as Martin seeks Senate confirmation.Source: Mother JonesUnder Trump, National Security Guardrails VanishWhat Happened: Trump has significantly damaged national security defenses\u2014firing NSA/Cyber Command chief Gen. Haugh, dissolving the FBI\u2019s foreign influence unit, and shutting down disinformation teams at State and CISA. Loyalty to Trump overrides expertise, with figures like Laura Loomer influencing policy.Why It Matters: The U.S. is wide open to foreign disinformation, cyber attacks, and propaganda\u2014and it\u2019s by design. Trump has obliterated the guardrails protecting national security, replacing them with blind obedience and chaos. America\u2019s adversaries are celebrating and this is a national emergency.Source: New York TimesSubscribe\ud83d\udce2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics NewsDOGE Is Building a Master Database to Surveil and Track ImmigrantsWhat Happened: Musk is building a vast surveillance database at DHS, merging IRS, Social Security, immigration, biometric, and voter data. Whistleblowers say DOGE is bypassing privacy laws, while oversight offices are being gutted\u2014clearing the way for real-time tracking and profiling of immigrants.Why It Matters: This is the infrastructure for a mass surveillance state\u2014targeted first at immigrants, but expandable to anyone Trump and his allies deem enemies. It\u2019s authoritarian, invasive, and illegal. Musk is building the tools for political repression, and if left unchecked, this will be expanded to all Americans.Source: WIREDI covered this in more detail, \u2014 the link is at the bottom of this tracker.Trump Scraps COVID Website, Pushes China Lab-Leak TheoryWhat Happened: The Trump White House has replaced the federal government\u2019s official COVID-19 website with one promoting the lab-leak theory, blaming China for the pandemic. The new site also targets Dr. Fauci, Andrew Cuomo, and the WHO, while removing public health guidance like vaccine and treatment info.Why It Matters: Trump is rewriting the pandemic to suit his political narrative\u2014scrubbing facts, erasing science, and weaponizing disinformation. It\u2019s not just revisionism but a calculated move to sow distrust in government, undermine public health, and inflame his base at the expense of the truth.Source: USA TODAYTrump\u2019s DOJ Claims Academic Journals Hold \u201cPartisan\u201d Stance in Scientific DebatesWhat Happened: The Department of Justice sent a letter to the respected medical journal CHEST, accusing it of taking \u201cpartisan\u201d stances in scientific debates. The letter, signed by acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, demanded information about how the journal handles \u201ccompeting viewpoints\u201d and implied that scientific publications may be \u201cmisleading\u201d the public due to sponsorships or bias.Why It Matters: This is an attack on academic freedom and scientific integrity. The weaponized DOJ is trying to intimidate medical journals into platforming disinformation and politicizing science\u2014echoing tactics used in authoritarian regimes to undermine truth and control public discourse.Source: Mother JonesFor now, Pentagon and DHS won\u2019t recommend that Trump invoke the Insurrection ActWhat Happened: Hegseth and Noem will not recommend invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops for immigration arrests, citing low current border crossings. Why It Matters: Trump wants to use the military for domestic law enforcement\u2014a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. The infrastructure for mass detention is already being built and this is only a temporary pause. Something to monitor very closely and push back against.Source: CNN\u2018He\u2019s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles\u2019: Trump holds up altered image of Abrego Garcia\u2019s handWhat Happened: Trump held up what appears to be a doctored photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s hand showing \u201cMS-13\u201d tattoos to justify his deportation\u2014despite no court evidence of gang ties and prior admission it was an administrative error. Recent TikToks from Garcia\u2019s wife show no such tattoo, and legal filings never mentioned it.Why It Matters: This is classic authoritarian disinformation: share manufactured \u201cevidence\u201d to vilify your target, undermine the courts, and sell illegal actions to the public. Trump is copying the autocrat playbook.Source: The Independent\ud83d\uded1 In Human and Civil Rights Abuses NewsUS citizen says he and his wife detained without explanation after returning from CanadaWhat Happened: U.S. citizen Bachir Atallah and his wife were detained without explanation after reentering the U.S. from Canada. CBP handcuffed him, held them in separate cells, and confiscated their belongings. Denied his rights and medical help, Atallah now fears retaliation for speaking out.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration is sweeping up U.S. citizens in a climate of fear and impunity. Detaining Americans without cause or due process is authoritarian\u2014and it\u2019s a warning to us all.Source: CNNLawyers race to court to prevent imminent deportations under a rarely invoked wartime law.What Happened: The ACLU rushed to multiple courts to stop fast-tracked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u2014citing the lack of due process. Over 50 migrants were reportedly being loaded onto buses to El Salvador as emergency appeals reached the Supreme Court.Why It Matters: It\u2019s about bypassing the Constitution and setting the stage for mass removals under the guise of national security. Trump is desensitizing the public to abuses of power and laying the groundwork for a broader crackdown. If due process can be stripped from migrants, it can be stripped from anyone. This will turn inward.Source: New York TimesIndonesian student detained by ICE after US secretly revokes his visaWhat Happened: Aditya Wahyu Harsono, an Indonesian Muslim father with a valid visa and green card application, was ambushed by ICE at work after DHS secretly and retroactively revoked his visa. They cited a minor graffiti charge and a dismissed protest arrest to justify the move\u2014then filed a rare appeal to block his bond release. He remains jailed while his wife and special-needs infant face eviction and loss of healthcare.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s DHS is weaponizing immigration law to disappear people for political reasons\u2014targeting immigrants, Muslims, and activists. Secret revocations, bogus charges, and indefinite detention are the tools of a police state.Source: The Guardian\ud83d\udcc9 Government Services Disruption and Collapse WatchHegseth Said to Have Shared Attack Details in Second Signal ChatWhat Happened: Hegseth used a private Signal chat\u2014including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer\u2014to share sensitive operational details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, including F/A-18 flight schedules. This is the second known breach involving Hegseth leaking miltary strike plans via an unclassified app. Why It Matters: This is reckless, dangerous, and disqualifying. Trump\u2019s hand-picked Defense Secretary is a national security risk\u2014and must be fired.Source: New York TimesPentagon turmoil deepens: Top Hegseth aide leaves postWhat Happened: Hegseth\u2019s chief of staff Joe Kasper is out, joining three other top aides ousted this week amid a growing leak scandal and internal chaos. The Pentagon front office is now without a chief of staff, deputy, or senior adviser as dysfunction and distrust spiral.Why It Matters: The Pentagon is in meltdown mode. Hegseth has lost control, surrounded by infighting and firings. National security is being run by amateurs and loyalists and the cracks are widening fast. Our adversaries and allies are watching as America\u2019s military leadership descends into chaos, raising serious questions about U.S. readiness and global stability.Source: PoliticoMeasles Cases Soar to 800 What Happened: Measles infections in the U.S. have surged to 800 confirmed cases across 24 states with two deaths and another under investigation. The CDC reports that 96% of cases are among unvaccinated or status-unknown individuals. Why It Matters: This is what happens when an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist runs public health. Trump\u2019s appointment of RFK Jr. and the dismantling of vaccine programs are fueling a preventable crisis.Source: ABC NewsTrump\u2019s pick for acting IRS commissioner is ousted days after his appointmentWhat Happened: Gary Shapley, a controversial Trump appointee backed by Musk and congressional Republicans, was removed just days after being named acting IRS commissioner. His appointment, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was abroad, triggered backlash inside the Treasury Department. Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender will now serve in the role, marking the fifth leadership change at the IRS this year.Why It Matters: Musk tried to install a loyalist to control the IRS, part of a broader effort to politicize the tax system and target enemies. Even brief pushback shows how fragile our guardrails have become.Source: CNN\u2696\ufe0f Supreme Court WatchSupreme Court Temporarily Blocks Deportation of Venezuelan Men Under Trump\u2019s Wartime PowersWhat Happened: The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a temporary halt to Trump\u2019s planned deportation of Venezuelan men detained under the Alien Enemies Act, after the ACLU warned they were being removed without due process. The ruling came just hours after reports that some detainees had been loaded onto buses. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.Source: The Guardian\ud83c\udf10 Imperial and Geopolitical WatchTravel to the U.S. from almost everywhere is falling under TrumpWhat Happened: International travel to the U.S. has sharply declined since Trump returned to power, with a nearly 12% drop in March alone. Visitors from Western Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean have fallen by up to 26% year-over-year. The slump follows widespread reports of tourist detentions, deportations, and heightened surveillance. The EU now issues burner phones to officials traveling to the U.S. amid fears of data compromise.Why It Matters: This dramatic drop in tourism is a direct result of Trump\u2019s isolationist policies, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and erratic border enforcement. The backlash from foreign travelers will cost the U.S. economy billions and erode international relations. Source: Washington PostChina vows retaliation against countries that follow U.S. calls to isolate BeijingWhat Happened: China warned it will retaliate against any country that aligns with Trump\u2019s effort to isolate Beijing. This comes as Trump escalates his tariff war\u2014slapping a 145% duty on Chinese goods\u2014and pressures U.S. allies to join him.Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s unilateral economic warfare is dragging allies\u2014who he\u2019s also targeting with tariffs\u2014into a forced geopolitical standoff. It\u2019s accelerating global fragmentation, destabilizing trade, and weakening the alliances that once defined U.S. global leadership.Source: CNBC\ud83c\udf0d Far-Right & Russian Influence WatchTrump Ready to Recognize Russian Control of Crimea in Ukraine \u201cPeace\u201d DealWhat Happened: Trump is prepared to recognize Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea as part of a \u201cceasefire\u201d framework. The plan was shared with European and Ukrainian officials and discussed with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.Why It Matters: This is reprehensible. Trump is legitimizing Russia\u2019s deadly genocidal land grabs and betraying Ukraine, NATO, and international law. The U.S. under Trump is no longer a reliable ally\u2014it\u2019s a danger to the West and must be treated as such.Source: CNNTrump Threatens to Abandon Ukraine Peace Talks, Signals U.S. May Walk AwayWhat Happened: Trump threatened to walk away from Ukraine peace talks unless there\u2019s \u201cquick progress\u201d\u2014falsely equating Kyiv and Moscow, even as Russia commits genocide and bombs civilians daily. Rubio backed the ultimatum, warning the U.S. could exit negotiations within days. It\u2019s a betrayal of Ukraine and yet another broken promise from Trump, who once claimed he\u2019d end the war \u201cin 24 hours.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is laying the groundwork to abandon Ukraine after failing to force a surrender to Russia. If talks stall, he\u2019ll blame Ukraine and cut off U.S. support. Source: BBC News\ud83d\udcb5 In Trump Economic Downturn NewsTrump renews call for interest rate cut, says rates would be lower if Fed chief Powell \u2018understood what he was doing\u2019What Happened: Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, claiming interest rates would be lower \u201cif [Powell] understood what he was doing.\u201d Trump is reportedly exploring whether it can fire Powell before his term ends in 2026, following Powell\u2019s warning that Trump\u2019s tariffs could raise inflation. Trump also posted on Truth Social that \u201cPowell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough.\u201dWhy It Matters: Trump is trying to turn the Federal Reserve into a political weapon. By threatening to fire Powell, he\u2019s showing that even the U.S. economy isn\u2019t off-limits in his power grab. This is sabotage\u2014and it will trigger a global market meltdown.Source: CNBCVolvo to Cut 800 U.S. Jobs as Trump\u2019s Tariffs Hit Auto IndustryWhat Happened: Volvo announced plans to lay off up to 800 workers at three U.S. facilities, citing reduced demand and uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s trade policies. The layoffs will impact sites in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland. Why It Matters: Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff war is killing American jobs. Instead of creating jobs, his policies are driving up costs, slashing demand, and pushing U.S.-based manufacturers to cut back. Source: CNBCWith Only Bad Options, Businesses Scramble for a Tariff Chaos PlaybookWhat Happened: Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs on Chinese imports have blindsided U.S. businesses, forcing sudden layoffs, price hikes, canceled products, and offshored supply chains. Companies face millions in penalties, while vital goods like medical supplies and pianos are disappearing from shelves.Why It Matters: This is economic sabotage. Trump\u2019s erratic tariff policies are triggering a supply chain crisis, inflationary pressures, and massive layoffs, all while destabilizing U.S. manufacturers and retailers. Small businesses and startups are being crushed.

The court will hold hearings in May to assess whether her rights were violated.Source: Associated PressJudge Blocks DOGE From Laying Off 90% of Consumer Protection BureauWhat Happened: A federal judge halted Trump and Musk from purging over 1,400 employees\u2014roughly 90% of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014pending further evidence on the legality of the mass purge.

This is not economic nationalism\u2014it\u2019s economic destruction.Institutions Under Siege \u2014 Trump is purging watchdogs, gutting scientific agencies, and stacking national security posts with MAGA loyalists.

The move comes amid scrutiny of Trump\\u2019s ties to tech billionaires and accusations of pay-to-play influence.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is monetizing a children\\u2019s holiday, turning the Easter Egg Roll into a corporate cash grab.

The move guts civil service protections and makes it easier to purge career employees. Over 260,000 have already been purged or flagged for removal and this could affect hundreds of thousands more.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a mass purge to consolidate power. Trump is dismantling the professional, nonpartisan civil service and replacing it with a loyalty-based system\\u2014one step closer to authoritarian rule. It\\u2019s not about efficiency\\u2014it\\u2019s about power, control, and silencing dissent inside the government.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/trump-says-government-to-change-service-regulations-for-career-government-employees.html\\\\\\\">CNBC</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Law firms, universities, civil society groups in Trump's sights for punitive action</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump announced plans to review and potentially revoke the tax-exempt status of major institutions he sees as political enemies, including Harvard University, environmental groups, and watchdog nonprofit CREW. This follows a series of executive actions aimed at law firms and universities critical of his regime. Trump is abusing executive power to try to silence dissent and cripple civil society.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is authoritarianism in action.

The proposal slashes African operations, eliminates the UN liaison office, cancels DEI initiatives, and restricts Fulbright scholarships to national security fields. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is a full-scale takeover of U.S. diplomacy. Trump is dismantling global engagement, erasing human rights and climate diplomacy, and installing a loyalty-based foreign service.

This comes after Harvard refused to comply with Trump\\u2019s political demands to overhaul its admissions, faculty, and disciplinary policies. In retaliation, the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal grants and threatened Harvard\\u2019s tax-exempt status.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This political blackmail, along with fabricated cases, is one of the most common tactics used in Russia. Trump is weaponizing the federal government to punish universities that defy his authoritarian agenda.

Martin\\u2014who\\u2019s appeared over 150 times on Russian state TV and hired Trump allies, Michael Caputo and Neil McCabe,\\u2014faces bipartisan backlash and possible disbarment.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>Trump\\u2019s Justice Department is recycling disinformation and Kremlin garbage propaganda to rewrite the history of Russia\\u2019s attack on U.S. election and discredit investigators. It\\u2019s a dangerous abuse of prosecutorial power and a clear move to curry favor with Trump as Martin seeks Senate confirmation.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong> <em><strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/ed-martin-why-trumps-embattled-us-attorney-in-dc-is-talking-about-russia/\\\\\\\">Mother Jones</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><h3>Under Trump, National Security Guardrails Vanish</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Trump has significantly damaged national security defenses\\u2014firing NSA/Cyber Command chief Gen. Haugh, dissolving the FBI\\u2019s foreign influence unit, and shutting down disinformation teams at State and CISA. Loyalty to Trump overrides expertise, with figures like Laura Loomer influencing policy.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>The U.S. is wide open to foreign disinformation, cyber attacks, and propaganda\\u2014and it\\u2019s by design. Trump has obliterated the guardrails protecting national security, replacing them with blind obedience and chaos. America\\u2019s adversaries are celebrating and this is a national emergency.</p><pre><code><strong>Source:</strong><em> <strong><a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-national-security.html\\\\\\\">New York Times</a></strong></em></code></pre><div><hr></div><p class=\\\\\\\"button-wrapper\\\\\\\" data-attrs=\\\\\\\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"ButtonCreateButton\\\\\\\"><a class=\\\\\\\"button primary\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"https://trumptyrannytracker.substack.com/subscribe?\\\\\\\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>\\uD83D\\uDCE2 In Media Suppression and Authoritarian Tactics News</strong></h3><p></p><h3>DOGE Is Building a Master Database to Surveil and Track Immigrants</h3><p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Musk is building a vast surveillance database at DHS, merging IRS, Social Security, immigration, biometric, and voter data. Whistleblowers say DOGE is bypassing privacy laws, while oversight offices are being gutted\\u2014clearing the way for real-time tracking and profiling of immigrants.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is the infrastructure for a mass surveillance state\\u2014targeted first at immigrants, but expandable to anyone Trump and his allies deem enemies.

The new site also targets Dr. Fauci, Andrew Cuomo, and the WHO, while removing public health guidance like vaccine and treatment info.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump is rewriting the pandemic to suit his political narrative\\u2014scrubbing facts, erasing science, and weaponizing disinformation.

CBP handcuffed him, held them in separate cells, and confiscated their belongings. Denied his rights and medical help, Atallah now fears retaliation for speaking out.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Trump\\u2019s crackdown on immigration is sweeping up U.S. citizens in a climate of fear and impunity.

Over 50 migrants were reportedly being loaded onto buses to El Salvador as emergency appeals reached the Supreme Court.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> It\\u2019s about bypassing the Constitution and setting the stage for mass removals under the guise of national security. Trump is desensitizing the public to abuses of power and laying the groundwork for a broader crackdown. If due process can be stripped from migrants, it can be stripped from anyone.

This is the second known breach involving Hegseth leaking miltary strike plans via an unclassified app. </p><p><strong>Why It Matters: </strong>This is reckless, dangerous, and disqualifying.

His appointment, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was abroad, triggered backlash inside the Treasury Department. Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender will now serve in the role, marking the fifth leadership change at the IRS this year.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Musk tried to install a loyalist to control the IRS, part of a broader effort to politicize the tax system and target enemies.

Visitors from Western Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean have fallen by up to 26% year-over-year. The slump follows widespread reports of tourist detentions, deportations, and heightened surveillance. The EU now issues burner phones to officials traveling to the U.S. amid fears of data compromise.</p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This dramatic drop in tourism is a direct result of Trump\\u2019s isolationist policies, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and erratic border enforcement.
