# AI Integration Guide - Multiple AI Tools

## ü§ñ Overview
This guide helps you use AI assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to work with the Kleptocracy Timeline repository effectively.

## üéØ Quick Start for Any AI Tool

### Initial Context Setting
Start your session with this prompt:
```
I'm working on the Kleptocracy Timeline project - a critical documentation project tracking democratic capture from 1970-2025. This is Open Source Intelligence for democratic defense.

The repository has:
- 395+ events documenting systematic corruption
- 1,900+ sources that must be verifiable
- 9 capture lanes categorizing democratic erosion
- AGENT.md files in key directories with specific instructions

Please read the AGENT.md files in the relevant directories before making changes.
```

## üì± Tool-Specific Instructions

### Claude Code (Recommended)
**Strengths**: Deep context understanding, file operations, complex analysis

```
1. Open repository in Claude Code
2. Say: "Read all AGENT.md files to understand the project structure"
3. Use for: Pattern analysis, bulk operations, creating new investigations
```

### ChatGPT (GPT-4 with Code Interpreter)
**Strengths**: Data analysis, visualization, quick scripts

```
1. Upload key files:
   - timeline_complete.json
   - Relevant AGENT.md files
   - Event YAML files you're working on

2. Initial prompt:
   "I've uploaded timeline data from the Kleptocracy Timeline project. 
   Help me [analyze patterns/validate events/create visualizations]."

3. For ongoing work:
   - Use Custom Instructions to maintain context
   - Save analysis notebooks for continuity
```

#### ChatGPT Custom Instructions Template
```
What would you like ChatGPT to know about you?
I'm working on the Kleptocracy Timeline - documenting democratic capture 1970-2025.
Repository: github.com/markramm/KleptocracyTimeline
Focus: Data accuracy, source verification, pattern analysis

How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
- Be rigorous about source verification
- Follow YAML naming: YYYY-MM-DD--event-name-with-hyphens (NO underscores)
- Require 2+ sources for 'confirmed' status
- Focus on patterns, not partisan politics
- Cite specific event IDs when referencing timeline
```

### Cursor AI
**Strengths**: IDE integration, refactoring, code generation

```
1. Open repository in Cursor
2. Index the codebase (@codebase command)
3. Reference AGENT.md files with @file
4. Use for: React component updates, validation scripts, bulk edits
```

### GitHub Copilot
**Strengths**: In-line suggestions, boilerplate code

```
1. Install in VS Code
2. Open relevant AGENT.md alongside work
3. Use comments to guide generation:
   # Following timeline_data/AGENT.md validation rules
   # Create event following YYYY-MM-DD--hyphen-format
```

### Perplexity AI
**Strengths**: Real-time web search, source verification

```
Use for verifying timeline events:
"Verify this event from the Kleptocracy Timeline:
[paste event YAML]
Find additional sources and check facts."
```

## üîÑ Common Workflows Across AI Tools

### 1. Adding New Events
```
PROMPT: I need to add a new event to the timeline about [topic].
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Sources: [URLs]

Please:
1. Check for duplicates in existing events
2. Verify sources match the event
3. Create YAML following timeline_data/AGENT.md standards
4. Generate proper ID: YYYY-MM-DD--event-name-with-hyphens
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis
```
PROMPT: Analyze timeline_complete.json to find:
- Events involving [actor/organization]
- Patterns in [capture lane]
- Acceleration in [time period]
- Network connections between actors

Output as markdown with event ID citations.
```

### 3. Source Verification
```
PROMPT: Verify these sources for timeline event [ID]:
1. Check if URLs are accessible
2. Confirm they discuss this specific event
3. Extract key quotes supporting claims
4. Create archive.org links
5. Note any discrepancies
```

### 4. Validation and QA
```
PROMPT: Run QA checks on this event:
[paste YAML]

Check:
- ID format (hyphens only, no underscores)
- Date format and logic
- Source accessibility
- Summary completeness (who/what/when/where/why)
- Status appropriateness
```

## üéØ Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### DO:
‚úÖ Always provide AGENT.md context first
‚úÖ Specify which directory you're working in
‚úÖ Request verification of sources
‚úÖ Ask for duplicate checks
‚úÖ Validate YAML before committing
‚úÖ Use specific event IDs in discussions
‚úÖ Request citations for all claims

### DON'T:
‚ùå Accept AI-generated events without verification
‚ùå Use underscores in IDs (always hyphens)
‚ùå Mark future events as 'confirmed'
‚ùå Skip source verification
‚ùå Add partisan language
‚ùå Create events without checking duplicates

## üìä Optimizing Different AI Tools

### For Analysis Tasks
**Best tools**: Claude Code, ChatGPT with Code Interpreter
```python
# Example prompt for analysis
"Load timeline_complete.json and:
1. Count events by year
2. Find top 10 most connected actors
3. Identify acceleration patterns
4. Create network visualization
5. Export findings as markdown"
```

### For Code Development
**Best tools**: Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
```javascript
// Example prompt for React component
"Update EnhancedTimelineView.js to:
1. Add filter for capture lanes
2. Implement date range selector
3. Follow existing component patterns
4. Maintain URL state sync"
```

### For Content Creation
**Best tools**: Claude, ChatGPT
```markdown
# Example prompt for Substack post
"Using events from 2025-01 to 2025-02:
1. Identify key patterns
2. Write analysis in AI Discovery series style
3. Cite specific event IDs
4. Focus on pattern recognition
5. Avoid partisan language"
```

## üîß Handling AI Limitations

### Context Window Management
For large operations with limited context:
1. Break into smaller tasks
2. Process in batches
3. Save intermediate results
4. Maintain session notes

### Consistency Across Sessions
Create a session file:
```markdown
# Session: [Date] - [Task]
## Context
Working on: [specific task]
Directory: [path]
Relevant AGENT.md: [list]

## Progress
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Key Information
- Event ID format: YYYY-MM-DD--hyphenated-name
- Status rules: [pending/confirmed/disputed]
- Source requirements: 2+ for confirmed
```

### Verification Protocol
Always verify AI output:
```bash
# After AI generates events
python timeline_data/validate_yaml.py

# Check for duplicates
grep -r "similar-title" timeline_data/events/

# Verify sources
python tools/validation/check_all_links.py
```

## üöÄ Advanced Integration

### Chaining AI Tools
1. **Perplexity**: Find and verify sources
2. **ChatGPT**: Analyze and create event YAML
3. **Claude Code**: Validate and integrate into timeline
4. **Cursor**: Update React components

### Custom GPTs for Timeline Work
Create a custom GPT with:
- Knowledge: Upload AGENT.md files
- Instructions: Timeline standards and rules
- Actions: GitHub API for direct commits

### API Integration
```python
# Example: Automated validation with AI
import openai

def validate_event_with_ai(event_yaml):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": open('timeline_data/AGENT.md').read()},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Validate this event:\n{event_yaml}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## üìã Prompt Templates

### Event Creation
```
Create a timeline event:
Topic: [describe]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Sources: [list URLs]
Capture lanes: [select from 9 lanes]
Importance: [1-10]

Follow timeline_data/AGENT.md standards exactly.
```

### Pattern Investigation
```
Investigate pattern in timeline:
Pattern: [describe]
Time range: [start] to [end]
Output:
1. Supporting events (with IDs)
2. Key actors involved
3. Financial flows if any
4. Acceleration metrics
5. Visualization suggestions
```

### Quality Assurance
```
QA check for timeline_data/events/:
1. Find events with single sources
2. Identify missing archive links
3. Check for duplicate events
4. Validate date consistency
5. Ensure summary completeness
```
