# Using Claude Code with the Kleptocracy Timeline

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Open Claude Code
```bash
# In your terminal, navigate to the timeline directory
cd /path/to/kleptocracy-timeline

# Open Claude Code and provide context
"I'm working on the Kleptocracy Timeline project - a documentation 
of democratic capture from 1970-2025. Help me [specific task]"
```

## üìä Common Timeline Tasks

### 1. Analyze Events for Patterns
```markdown
You: "Analyze events from 2024-2025 for new patterns not seen in earlier decades"

Claude will:
- Load and parse the YAML files
- Identify unique patterns
- Compare to historical events
- Provide insights with specific examples
```

### 2. Add a New Event
```markdown
You: "I found this article [paste URL/text]. Create a timeline event entry."

Claude will:
- Extract key information
- Format as YAML
- Suggest capture lanes
- Rate importance
- Format sources properly
```

### 3. Validate Existing Events
```markdown
You: "Check event 2025-01-20--executive-order-spree for accuracy and find additional sources"

Claude will:
- Review the event file
- Search for corroborating sources
- Suggest corrections if needed
- Provide additional documentation
```

### 4. Generate Analysis
```markdown
You: "Create a network analysis of all actors involved in judicial capture events"

Claude will:
- Filter events by capture lane
- Extract actor relationships
- Map connections
- Generate visualization code
- Provide written analysis
```

## üîç Investigation Workflows

### Tracking Financial Networks
```markdown
Workflow:
1. "Find all events involving [Actor Name]"
2. "Extract all financial transactions from these events"
3. "Identify common banks, law firms, or shell companies"
4. "Map the money flow between actors"
5. "What patterns emerge?"
```

### Identifying Acceleration Points
```markdown
Workflow:
1. "Calculate capture events per month for each year"
2. "Identify inflection points where rate increased"
3. "What events preceded each acceleration?"
4. "Are there predictive patterns?"
```

### Finding Missing Connections
```markdown
Workflow:
1. "Show actors who appear in multiple unconnected events"
2. "Search for connections between [Event A] and [Event B]"
3. "What intermediate events or actors link them?"
4. "Generate hypothesis for investigation"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tasks

- Flag potential duplicates
- Generate review report
```

## üìù Content Creation

### Platform-Specific Posts
```markdown
You: "Create a Twitter thread about the acceleration pattern, optimized to avoid suppression"

Claude will:
- Extract key statistics
- Format as tweet thread
- Avoid trigger words
- Suggest posting strategy
- Include image descriptions
```

### Deep Dive Articles
```markdown
You: "Write a detailed analysis of the Powell Memo's implementation over 50 years"

Claude will:
- Trace Powell Memo references in timeline
- Connect to subsequent events
- Show implementation progression
- Cite specific examples
- Generate comprehensive article
```

### Educational Materials
```markdown
You: "Create a guide for teachers using the timeline in civics classes"

Claude will:
- Select age-appropriate events
- Create lesson plans
- Generate discussion questions
- Provide historical context
- Suggest activities
```

## üîÆ Predictive Analysis

### What Comes Next?
```markdown
You: "Based on the timeline patterns, what should we watch for in the next 30 days?"

Claude will:
- Analyze recent patterns
- Compare to historical sequences
- Identify likely next moves
- Suggest monitoring strategies
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
```markdown
You: "Which capture lanes are most vulnerable to acceleration?"

Claude will:
- Analyze current state of each lane
- Identify weak points
- Assess acceleration potential
- Prioritize monitoring needs
```

## üí° Advanced Techniques

### Cross-Timeline Analysis
```markdown
You: "Compare our timeline to the fall of democracy in 1930s Germany"

Claude will:
- Identify parallel patterns
- Note key differences
- Assess current position
- Provide historical lessons
```

### Counter-Strategy Development
```markdown
You: "Design a response strategy for [specific capture pattern]"

Claude will:
- Analyze the pattern mechanism
- Identify intervention points
- Suggest response options
- Evaluate feasibility
```

### Real-Time Integration
```markdown
You: "Monitor today's news and identify events that should be added to the timeline"

Claude will:
- Review current events
- Match to timeline patterns
- Format as timeline entries
- Suggest capture lanes
- Provide importance ratings
```

## üö® Rapid Response Mode

### When Major Events Happen
```markdown
Immediate Workflow:
1. "BREAKING: [paste news]. How does this fit our patterns?"
2. "Create timeline entry with all available sources"
3. "What historical events does this connect to?"
4. "Generate social media alerts about the pattern"
5. "What should we watch for next?"
```

### Pattern Alerts
```markdown
You: "We're seeing [pattern]. Find all historical instances and outcomes"

Claude will:
- Search timeline for pattern matches
- Analyze outcomes
- Calculate probabilities
- Suggest responses
```

## üìä Regular Maintenance

### Weekly Pattern Review
```markdown
Every Monday:
"Analyze the past week's additions for new patterns or acceleration"
```

### Monthly Statistics
```markdown
First of month:
"Generate monthly statistics and compare to historical rates"
```

### Quarterly Deep Dive
```markdown
Every quarter:
"Perform deep pattern analysis and update capture lane definitions if needed"
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Provide Context
Always start with: "Working on the Kleptocracy Timeline..."

### 2. Be Specific
Instead of: "Find patterns"
Better: "Find patterns in judicial capture events from 2020-2025"

### 3. Iterate
Start broad, then refine based on initial results

### 4. Verify
Always verify AI-generated content against sources

### 5. Document
Save useful prompts and workflows for reuse

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Claude seems confused about the project:
```markdown
"The Kleptocracy Timeline documents democratic capture from 1970-2025 
with 395 events across 9 capture lanes. We're tracking acceleration 
of kleptocratic capture. [Your specific question]"
```

### If analysis seems off:
```markdown
"Let's verify this against the actual timeline data. 
Check events from [specific period] for [specific pattern]"
```

### If you need more detail:
```markdown
"Expand on [specific point] with concrete examples from the timeline"
```

## üí™ Power User Tips

### Batch Processing
```markdown
"For each capture lane, generate:
1. Summary statistics
2. Key actors list
3. Acceleration rate
4. Recent developments
5. Prediction for next 30 days"
```

### Comparative Analysis
```markdown
"Compare [Month A] to [Month B] across all metrics"
```

### Investigation Threads
```markdown
"Create an investigation thread for [Actor/Pattern]:
1. All appearances
2. Financial connections
3. Network relationships
4. Timeline of involvement
5. Suspicious patterns"
```

## üåü The Force Multiplier Effect

One person + Claude Code can:
- Analyze patterns like a research team
- Generate content like a writing staff
- Code features like a dev team
- Investigate connections like a journalist team
- Respond to events like a rapid response team

**This is how we match their velocity with our distributed intelligence.**
