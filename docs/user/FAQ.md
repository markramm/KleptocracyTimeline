# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## üéØ About the Project

### What is the Kleptocracy Timeline?
The Kleptocracy Timeline is an open-source intelligence project documenting the systematic capture of democratic institutions from 1970 to 2025. It tracks 395+ verified events showing how democratic norms have been eroded through coordinated efforts across multiple domains.

### Why was this created?
To make invisible patterns visible. By documenting and connecting events across decades, we can see the systematic nature of democratic erosion that might otherwise appear as isolated incidents. This is intelligence infrastructure for democratic defense.

### Who created this?
This project was initiated by Mark Ramm and developed with the help of AI assistants to accelerate pattern recognition and analysis. It's now a community-driven effort welcoming contributions from anyone committed to factual documentation.

### Is this project partisan?
No. The timeline documents actions and their consequences regardless of political party. We focus on verifiable events, not partisan narratives. The data shows patterns of institutional capture that transcend party lines.

## üìä About the Data

### How many events are documented?
Currently 395+ events spanning from 1970 to 2025, with exponential acceleration in recent years (162x increase from the 1970s to 2025).

### What are the "9 Capture Lanes"?
Through pattern analysis, we identified nine systematic methods of democratic erosion:
1. **Judicial Capture & Corruption** - Control of courts
2. **Electoral Manipulation & Voter Suppression** - Undermining voting
3. **Media Capture & Propaganda** - Information control
4. **Regulatory Capture & Dismantling** - Weakening oversight
5. **Financial Corruption & Money Laundering** - Illicit finance
6. **Executive Power Expansion** - Authoritarian consolidation
7. **Legislative Dysfunction & Capture** - Breaking governance
8. **Intelligence & Security Abuse** - Surveillance and control
9. **Social Division & Violence** - Fragmenting society

### How are events verified?
Every event requires:
- Minimum 2 credible sources
- Verification of claims against sources
- Archive creation for source preservation
- Cross-reference checking for consistency
- Community validation

### What does "importance" rating mean?
Events are rated 1-10 based on:
- Systemic impact on democratic institutions
- Number of people affected
- Precedent-setting nature
- Acceleration of capture patterns
- Long-term consequences

### Why do some events show as "predicted"?
Events scheduled for future dates are marked "predicted" until they occur and can be verified. These are based on announced plans, scheduled votes, or documented intentions.

## üîß Technical Questions

### What technology powers this?
- **Data**: YAML files with rigorous schema validation
- **Frontend**: React.js with static JSON data
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (no backend required)
- **Visualization**: D3.js for network graphs
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for collaboration

### Can I download the data?
Yes! All data is open source:
- **Full timeline**: `/timeline_complete.json`
- **Individual events**: `/timeline_data/events/*.yaml`
- **API endpoints**: `/viewer/public/api/*.json`

### Is there an API?
Currently, we provide static JSON files that can be fetched directly. A full API is planned for future development.

### Why no backend/database?
Static files ensure:
- Maximum resilience (can't be taken down easily)
- Easy replication (anyone can host a copy)
- Version control (full history in Git)
- No maintenance costs
- Fast performance
